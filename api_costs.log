Abstract: Since the epoch-defining Pax Thatcher- Reagan, orthodox conservatism has entailed an absolute belief in the absolute virtue of the free market. The coiled rattlesnake of the libertarian Gadsden Flag can perhaps be said to have been refigured as a rattlesnake in the shape of a dollar sign; “Don’t Tread on Me” has metamorphosed into “Don’t Tread on the Free Market”. Whilst the Left often defines itself by principles and ideals (however vague), those on the Right have developed a propensity to define themselves by the technocratic ideals of bureaucratic efficiency and sound economic stewardship.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Kennett and Court Compared: Leadership Styles and Industrial Relations Reform in Victoria and Western Australia in the 1990s

Abstract: This article argues that political leadership in liberal democracies is measured by the achievement of goals. In order to achieve their goals leaders must overcome constraints and exploit opportunities in the social and economic environment. This is done through the deployment of the institutional capacity at their disposal which carries with it a set of constraints and opportunities. We argue that it is the way in which leaders deploy their institutional capacity which illustrates their own particular leadership style. We do so, with reference to industrial relations reforms of the 1990s, first in Victoria under Jeff Kennett and then in Western Australia under Richard Court. We argue that in this case, leadership style determined the success of achieving policy goals, and thus defined successful political leadership.

Abstract: This article examines the governance challenges facing Australian local government, which include lack of constitutional standing, intergovernmental dependencies, financial constraints and weak democratic standing. The historical context has shaped the nature and place of local government in the Australian federal polity and has contributed to the tensions created by an expansion of the roles and responsibilities of local government, especially in the provision of services, which is not matched by concomitant increases in financial capacity and local autonomy. These governance challenges are discussed with a view to establishing local government’s capacity for autonomous self-governance in the face of intergovernmental and fiscal dependencies, and the implications of this for local government reform trajectories.

Abstract: This article critically analyses the landmark reform of the Victorian court system from a comparative international perspective. It is argued that the institutional design of Court Services Victoria (’CSV’) was largely driven by a desire to protect judicial independence from the executive government and partly also to enhance the institutional capacity of the judiciary to eff ectively respond to the emerging social, political and legal challenges. Despite the establishment of CSV, the legislation preserves certain legacy administrative arrangements that impeded court administration in the past, such as the internal governance arrangements in the courts and the absence of clearly defi ned lines of administrative responsibility. The article also argues that the legislation confers too narrow a function on CSV that focuses on the provision of basic technical and administrative support to the courts. The proposed alternative would be for CSV to assume a much broader developmental mandate in the court system in order to improve the quality of the administration of justice. The article also argues that greater “corporatisation” of the judiciary will be necessary in order to protect its hard-fought independence and visibility in the political arena. The article concludes that greater judicial independence requires more, rather than less, political astuteness and engagement by the judiciary with the other branches of government and the public.

Abstract: Peer review of economic policies by countries comprises peer learning, peer support and peer pressure. Durable peer review processes focus on mutual peer learning and support as peer pressure rarely works unless countries can be convinced that a policy is in their national interest. It requires a high degree of trust and respect, sharing of information, analytical and administrative capacity and legitimacy. Proximity may lead to greater trust and openness, but it may also be associated with long-standing historical differences and grievances. In principle peer review could be a useful adjunct to other aspects of a regional integration strategy designed to bring mutual benefit to the participating countries. In the Asian context there appears ample scope for well designed peer review to contribute to domestic policy development.

Abstract: Issue addressed: A key factor underpinning the ability of people to build physical activity into their everyday life is a suitable physical environment. The physical environment is outside the jurisdiction of the health sector and, at the local level, is primarily the responsibility of local government through local planning functions. There are few studies assessing the opportunities for local government to work with health on promoting participation in physical activity. Methods: Using semi-structured interviews, a case study of one council’s organisational capacity to promote physical activity was conducted. Results: The results show that while health and physical activity were not necessarily seen as core business of council, they linked in with council’s commitment to community wellbeing and environmental development. A unifying theme was the opportunity for a partnership between health promotion and local government bodies to promote a positive, local lifestyle. Conclusion: The findings provide a sound basis for pursuing a partnership in the case of this council and point to the value of further research, exploring how these themes apply more generally and the extent to which this potential is realised in practice. So what? Systematic analysis of council’s capacity to contribute to promoting physical activity can be used to guide the development of a comprehensive, intersectoral approach to this task.

Abstract: Melbourne Water’s Living Rivers Program works in partnership with local governments to build collective capacity to implement Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD). An assessment tool to quantify the change in capacity and identify individual needs for driving capacity improvement within local government was created and applied. Known as the Needs Analysis, the tool identifies relative municipal capacity against nine predetermined themes, each identified as fundamental to the delivery of WSUD. The tool provides a snapshot of internal commitment and resourcing for the management of WSUD, and a basis for strategic program interventions. A comparative analysis of results from the first (2006/07) and second (2010/11) phases of the Needs Analysis is presented. In summary, 83% of local governments have increased in their capacity to deliver WSUD. Differing levels of capacity are evident between inner, outer and rural/regional municipalities. There are also common attributes between high, medium and low performing councils, where institutional impediments such as commitment and policy significantly influence a council’s capacity to deliver sustainable stormwater management. Insights from the Needs Analysis are shaping the program design to tailor to individual and regional capacity needs of local government, thereby stimulating further capacity growth.

Abstract: Despite the billions of dollars invested in improving Indigenous health and wellbeing outcomes in Australia, there is little evidence of program effectiveness to inform policy and practice. The deficiency of evaluations is problematic. Critical to this process is the effective engagement of commissioners with Indigenous peoples, which is not well documented. Currently, there is scant evidence on modes of commissioning practices used. This scoping review will aim to identify the spectrum of commissioning practices used when evaluating Indigenous health and wellbeing programs in Australia, codifying them into a model set. Documents (between 2008 and 2020) will be retrieved from Scopus, Proquest, Informit, Google Scholar and via a web-based search that refers to the commissioning of Indigenous health and wellbeing program evaluations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada or the United States. Importantly, the research team is Indigenous-led and the project’s governance, quality and translation framework will be informed by a project advisory group, including Indigenous associates. This will be the first scoping review globally to identify practices used to commission Indigenous health and wellbeing program evaluations. Results will be utilised to strengthen the commissioning practices of Indigenous health and wellbeing programs in Australia and overseas.

Abstract: In the context of climate change, the Danish water sector is experiencing two major pressures. On one hand, a number of agents are pushing towards more sustainable urban water management (SUWM) approaches with the aim of improving surface water quality and mitigating flood risk. On the other hand, as part of an international trend, the municipal water management departments were transformed to locally created not-for-profit corporatized companies. Main drivers for corporatization are increased efficiency and cost recovery by reduced municipal control on utility budgets. Scholars have described the influencing factors for transitioning to SUWM and highlighted the potential governance attributes for enhancing and/or constraining such change. This paper explores the corporatization of the water sector and its implications for transitioning to SUWM. On the base of a preliminary literature review we identify the rationales for and drawbacks of corporatization and compare them with the critical factors to build institutional capacity for SUWM. Preliminary results suggest that corporatization is expected to create a range of challenges that might hinder the transition towards more SUWM approaches. A more direct collaboration of the national regulator of competitive performances with government institutions and other nongovernmental actors might be an effective answer to such challenges.

Abstract: This paper considers the implementation of new whole-of-government arrangements in Indigenous Affairs. It outlines key aspects designed to address Indigenous disadvantage, including the COAG trials, bilateral agreements, Indigenous Coordination Centres, and Shared Responsibility and Regional Partnership Agreements with Indigenous communities. It situates these within broader experience of “new governance” approaches in Australia, and then considers some of the governance capacity issues that are highlighted as governments attempt these arrangements in Indigenous Australia. It considers some key findings from evaluations of the COAG trials and from research on Indigenous community governance, which each provide lessons for governments and Indigenous communities if new governance arrangements are to lead to better outcomes for Indigenous people.

Abstract: Increasingly, Australian local governments are being asked to strengthen their commitment and role in public health and health promotion. Federally, the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health (NPAPH), funded local government to deliver community-based physical activity and healthy eating programs, and to develop a range of local policies that support healthy lifestyle behaviours. In South Australia, the Public Health Act 2011 makes local government responsible, for the first time, for taking action to preserve, protect and promote public health within its area. Similar legislation has been enacted in other states.

Abstract: This article discusses some aspects of a larger study conducted to explore the challenges and barriers to implementing an integrated urban water management (IUWM) strategy in Adelaide. It is based on an internet survey of 55 key actors representing various stakeholder groups from both the public and private sectors. While the key actors identified several challenges and barriers, this paper focuses on two factors: organisational culture and institutional capacity. Clearly the stakeholders perceived these as barriers to implementing IUWM and clarified that some of the other challenges, such as ownership and access rights, are related to the “new” water sources such as stormwater and recycled wastewater.

Abstract: This paper concerns the Australian Government’s call for a resource rent tax for iron ore and coal; and extension of the existing rent tax for petroleum. Our main objective has been to address the Australian Government’s conduct of the tax reform consultation process for its proposed resource rent tax legislation. To ascertain the Government’s effectiveness in the consultative process toward legislative design, our focus is on the contentious issue of the method for valuation of starting-base assets (or capital assets) because of their deductibility from revenue subject to tax. This paper analyses relevant stakeholder submissions to the Government’s request for input on the valuation of starting-base assets for Australia’s proposed resource rent taxes. We use the perspective of stakeholder theory and grounded theory methodology. The results of our research indicate that the Australian Government has lacked effectiveness in this consultation process. The contribution of this paper is of a grounded theory that frames three recommendations to improve the consultation process. We anticipate that the adoption of these recommendations would enhance the legitimacy of outcomes and promote taxpayer confidence in the resource rent taxes as well as eventually improve compliance.

Abstract: As the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) progresses through its implementation, calls for stewardship of the new disability market increase. As a personalisation scheme, the condition of the disability service markets are tied to the ability for people with disability to access care services. Market conditions such as thin markets, market gaps and market failure threaten the public policy goals of increased choice and control for NDIS participants. We review the evidence for interventions and other market stewardship actions that can be taken by government to steward a quasi-market that provides care or welfare services. We assess the breadth and quality of the evidence base and apply these findings to the case of the Australian NDIS. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to take actions to steward the NDIS market, but that considerable resources and governance capacity are needed to do so.

Abstract: The need to change urban water management to become more sustainable is widely recognised. Recently there has been considerable financial investment in urban water reform; however these reforms have not been as successful as anticipated, most likely because there is a lack of critical analysis of existing capacity and/or capacity deficits. Understanding and assessing institutional capacity is crucial to addressing existing institutional impediments. Institutional capacity includes the human resources, intra-organisational, inter-organisational and/or external rules and incentives capacity spheres. Institutional capacity assessment is essential to form coherent and demand driven capacity development strategies. This paper proposes a tentative institutional capacity assessment framework derived from a meta-analysis of empirical research, across five different disciplinary areas, into capacity attributes most likely to advance sustainable urban water management. Forty-two publications were reviewed and the most frequently determined capacity attributes identified. The proposed schema of enabling capacities for sustainable urban water management could be used by policy makers and practitioners for city-wide strategic planning of future investment in capacity building. This would improve the opportunity for critically informing and improving the design of current and future water reform practices.

Abstract: This article examines the implementation of the African Union counter-terrorism framework by member states. It argues that the state level governance involved in implementing AU policy provisions is often ineffective due largely to a lack of relevant capacity by many African states. This article first critiques terrorism and the military approach to counter terrorism by member states; then evaluates institutional capacity in a number of African states, showing that they often lack sufficient security governance to implement AU policies; and concludes with an evaluation of the inability of member states to contain Islamophobic tendencies within their jurisdictions.

Abstract: The “new age” of transparency heralded a raft of reforms to the “Freedom of Information Act 1982” (Cth) (FOI Act 1982) that shifted control of information away from government in a bid to increase transparency and accountability. Conclusive certificates, for example, were abolished in 2009 and a number of exemptions, including the exemption for deliberative documents, were made conditional on a single public interest test in 2010. Transparency is not, however, an absolute and cannot be an end in itself; it has value only insofar as it enhances accountability. Even then, the proper balance must be struck between transparency, efficiency and effectiveness. This paper considers the role and importance of transparency and its relationship to the public interest test in the FOI Act 1982. It examines the basis and impact of recent reforms and asks whether they do, in fact, strike the right balance in respect of the deliberative processes of government. Have the reforms resulted in more accountability or less? Is there a danger that we now have “too much of a good thing”, that is, transparency, but that efficiency, effectiveness and even accountability have been inappropriately compromised?

Abstract: To date social research into the institutional aspects of sustainable urban water management has predominately been conducted in developed urban contexts, resulting in a significant lack of insight into the institutional drivers and barriers in developing urban centres, which this research begins to address. This research project investigated the understanding, perceptions and motivation relating to the transition to sustainable urban water management practices in the rapidly growing urban centre of Port Vila, Vanuatu. The need for improved urban water management, practitioners’ awareness of potential solutions, barriers and opportunities to implement solutions were investigated through semi-structured, in-depth interviews with more than 40 individuals who were identified as having a significant role in urban water management from national and local government, aid and development agencies, consultants, and the tourism sector. The data analysis revealed that in contrast to developed contexts where socio-institutional barriers are the primary barriers to transitioning to SUWM, in Port Vila there continue to be a number of technical barriers limiting the potential to transition. Skills development regarding both technical and socio-institutional capacity will be essential for enabling the transition to SUWM in Port Vila in the coming years.

Abstract: Economic narratives of northern remote Australia frequently identify the attraction of large-scale resource projects as being pivotal to regional development prospects. Yet whereas such projects may generate significant benefits to the national economy, their impacts at the regional scale are more ambiguous. This paper seeks to decentre the resources sector as a regional development engine in northern remote Australia. Using recent research from the Kimberley region, it emphasises the economically detached regional character of contemporary resource projects and, in contrast, brings into focus the importance of public sector monies in underpinning local expenditure flows. For regional development practice, this analysis implies attention to (i) strategies that aim to encourage or oblige resources companies to strengthen their connections with the regions in which they operate and (ii) the facilitation of institutional capacity building, so that local communities are more able to articulate regional development aspirations and to negotiate with outside investors.

For regional development practice, this analysis implies attention to (i) strategies that aim to encourage or oblige resources companies to strengthen their connections with the regions in which they operate and (ii) the facilitation of institutional capacity building, so that local communities are more able to articulate regional development aspirations and to negotiate with outside investors.

Abstract: Government infrastructure provision is much more important than its conception in mainstream economic theory as a response to “market failure”. In practice, it draws on the state’s capacity to fund investment in large projects and bear the associated risks. Investing in infrastructure can also be an engine for accelerating economic growth, meeting community needs and serving diverse societal goals such as equity and sustainability. These broader considerations create an expectation for it to feature particularly prominently in any Labor government’s program.

Abstract: Developing and nurturing resilience is critical to the social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) of Indigenous Australian adolescents and their continuing life trajectories. The attendance of many Indigenous adolescents from remote communities at boarding schools creates a need to prioritise and proactively create opportunities that build and nurture student resilience. This requires sustainable and multi-dimensional school-wide approaches. Despite this need, there are no documented SEWB or resilience building approaches for Australian Indigenous students who attend boarding schools. We describe the use of participatory action research to develop and implement a two-year STEP-UP intervention with boarding schools, designed to create supportive environments for improving psychosocial resilience and wellbeing of remote-living Indigenous students. The intervention consisted of three components implemented annually across eight schools: a site-specific STEP-UP action plan; staff capacity development; and an annual Schools and Communities Conference. Thematic analysis of a systematic literature review, documented action planning, conference group processes, resilience theory and survey findings from the associated broader resilience study resulted in the identification of six resilience building domains: valuing culture and identity; developing cultural leadership; nurturing strong relationships; building social and emotional skills; creating safe, supportive environments; and building staff capacity. These domains became the resulting framework for STEP-UP planning and enabled focused examination of practices and future planning. Learnings from the intervention process suggest principles to consider when designing interventions: utilising a strengths-based approach; design responsiveness; collaborative partnerships; institutional capacity; and sustainability. A resilience toolkit website was developed to enable knowledge translation and sustainability beyond the study.

Abstract: Tax jurisdiction is a legal concept, but it is fundamentally dependent on state capacity, technology and politics. The jurisdictional boundaries of the tax state are in turn crucial in delimiting its taxing power. This article considers how tax jurisdictional concepts, in particular residence, source and the location of consumption, are changing as the capability of states to tax labour, capital and consumption changes in a global digital economy. These changes are occurring through contestation in the “borderlands” of the tax state, between multiple states and non-state actors. Governments can enhance tax capability by cooperating with each other and with global intermediaries and by adopting new technologies, but also take contradictory steps to abrogate tax jurisdiction. The article illustrates the discussion with examples of tax jurisdiction for individuals as residents, workers, investors or consumers; and for corporations, including recent global developments aimed at taxation of multinational enterprises.

Abstract: Blair’s Britain came to an end in June 2007 when, after ten years and one month, Tony Blair stepped down as Prime Minister. His decade in office will be remembered for many things: for ending eighteen years of electoral wilderness for the Labour party, albeit only by re-branding it as “New Labour”; for delivering unprecedented Labour majorities in the House of Commons; for the ruinous foreign policy misadventure in Iraq; for a curious and from no point of view altogether satisfactory combination of continuity and change in domestic public service reform; and for historic constitutional change. It is with this last feature that the present paper is concerned. Blair never wanted his legacy to be constitutional reform. He was never much interested in it and he inherited Labour’s commitment to deliver important parts of it from his (Scottish) predecessor, John Smith. Had Blair felt able to escape from these commitments, it is likely that devolution, at least, would not have been delivered under his premiership. As it is, however, constitutional reform might turn out to be the single most positive achievement of his decade in Downing Street.

Abstract: Chinese academics and officials argue that the country must store water to overcome seasonal fluctuations and move water to rebalance regional differences in supply and demand. As well as supplying water, however, such projects protect the political and economic status of powerful municipalities, stimulate Chinese economic growth, and proclaim the power and administrative capacity of the state. Underpinning Promethean water management is a hidden “empire”-China’s water machine-that assembles the capacities of corporations and institutions in an international network that facilitates state schemes. Yet, fixed infrastructure and their deterministic projections collide against shifting water demands and political interests and require subtle reconciliation of competing interests.

Abstract: Outsourcing Repression: Everyday State Power in Contemporary China, Lynette Ong’s new book with Oxford University Press, provides an original and realistic analysis of the Chinese state’s control over society beyond the usual focus of the study of authoritarian states, such as on outright coercion or censorship. Her concept of “everyday state power” sheds light on how the state’s control is typically experienced by ordinary citizens and illuminates the state’s repertoire for inducing citizens’ compliance with its top-down, sometimes drastic, policies. The “thugs-for-hire” are an expedient extension of the state’s formal coercive capacity, while the political, social, and economic brokers constitute the state’s penetrative “infrastructural power”. While grounded in the study of China’s state-driven urbanisation, this book also opens new space for us to understand the sources of the Chinese state’s power more broadly, especially how it manages to mobilise the masses in the implementation of radical policies that are often highly intrusive and disruptive. As such, the book can also inform our understanding of the zero-Covid policy currently being enforced in Shanghai and other Chinese cities: besides outright coercion, the state also deploys “brokers” with intimate knowledge of communities to “persuade” the masses into compliance, often on an emotional basis. The book calls for greater attention to the complexity of the interface between the state and society to decipher both the state’s capacity to govern and society’s capacity for resistance.

Abstract: The development of a Needs Analysis Tool by Melbourne Water builds on previous social research and other investigations into local government capacity for sustainable urban water management. The Tool provides a snapshot of internal commitment and resourcing for the management of stormwater quality and Water Sensitive Urban Design, and forms one component of Melbourne Water’s Stormwater Program’s assessment and development of structural and non-structural stormwater management initiatives with local government.  This Tool offers a practical and rapid way to track changes in the capacity of local government to deliver sustainable improvements in stormwater quality, with the benefits of the Needs Analysis Tool being two fold. Firstly, it identifies individual needs of local government, and allows for projects to be designed that address these specific capacity building requirements and intra-organisational issues. Secondly, it provides for a facilitative, partnership approach between local government and Melbourne Water that maximises the strengthening of internal capacity through effective project design and delivery. This multi-layered innovative approach is a move away from more traditional water grants programs and provides for a more sustainable funding model and inter-governmental partnership approach.

In 1999, celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex in at least three women’s studies centres in Australia (at the Universities of Tasmania, Queensland and Hinders University) also indicated the institutional capacity of Australian women’s studies to commemorate its past. In 1999, too, Hecate celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. Established in 1975, Hecate was preceded by Refractory Girl in 1973, the first women’s studies journal to be established in Australia. Australian Feminist Studies was established in 1985. This article interrogates the common assumption that women’s studies in Australia has shifted from a commitment to the liberation of women as a unity to a more complicated and theoretical project informed by the post- discourses: postmodernism, postcolonialism, post-structuralism, psycho-analysis. The question is explored through a reading of Refractory Girl, Hecate and Australian Feminist Studies and interviews with the editors of Hecate and Australian Feminist Studies: Carole Ferrier, Bronwen Levy, Susan Magarey and Sue Sheridan.

Abstract: Local Government is a key agent in sustainable tourism management through its roles in: planning; economic development; marketing; regulation; land and facility management; service provision; industry assistance; and community relations. Local Government, especially in regional Australia, is the public sector agency most closely linked to sustainable tourism agents in industry and community. A number of Local Government roles and responsibilities as they relate to sustainable tourism management are identified. Interventions aimed at improving sustainable touri sm management would be assisted by the capacity of Local Government to engage with these agents and perform these roles and responsibilities. The capacity of Local Government with regards to sustainable tourism management in Vic to ria may be hindered by issues of: isolation; access to resources; training and skills of key staff; internal conflicts; and the planning and governance of Local Government participation in tourism. Structures employed by Local Governments might be exploited to increase the capacity to implement sustainable tourism objectives. A survey was conducted to investigate these structures in terms of Local Government capacity to: integrate tourism related responsibilities within Council; conduct strategic planning; maintain relationships with external tourism stakeholders; implement tourism strategies; adequately resource tourism management; and maintain involvement with industry. Findings of the survey indicated that many of the core structures to enhance management capacity were in place in most Local Governments; however, there was a lack of understanding of the breadth of sustainable management implications arising from tourism activity. There was also a clear perception that Local Government did not adequately encourage sustainable tourism development. Local Government education programs may be developed to address these issues.

Abstract: This paper examines the origins, structure and activities of two regional development organizations in the Gippsland region, Victoria, during the past decade.

Abstract: Achieving sustainable urban water management for developed cities is likely to require continuing and significant paradigm changes for planners. Demand management thinking has already largely replaced supply augmentation perspectives, and there are a growing number of new technologies for water recycling and other innovative approaches such as decentralisation geared toward minimizing water withdrawals and pollution. However successful implementation of new approaches to wastewater management is a multi-faceted challenge requiring input beyond merely technical. Controversy and community opposition has stalled some innovative projects. As a result, there has been some recognition not only of the need for functional, cost effective technology, and protection of the environment and public health, but also for social acceptability. This paper takes the social acceptance theme a little further, probing questions of institutional capacity and decision-making processes across water management organizations, as these are considered equally important to sustainable water outcomes as merely whether or not the public will accept a technology.  This critical review of case studies of water management planning suggests that societal and institutional adaptation are critical issues for sustainable water management and highlights the need for significant change in the implementation of alternative water management strategies. Changing patterns of water use is a process of long-term institutional transformation. Based on this analysis, future policy directions should focus on facilitating stable predictable arrangements for making policy decisions in civic groups. This will involve long-term institutions for continuous negotiation among diverse stakeholders about meanings, values and relationships.

Abstract: The 2006 World Bank report “The Pacific Infrastructure Challenge” noted that infrastructure performance in Pacific countries is worse than in other small island states. A lack of long term planning (in both governments and aid donors), budget provision for maintenance, institutional capacity and co-ordination has led to diminished social, environmental and economic benefits to stakeholders after major assistance from donors has been completed.  Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) developed and applied a process to help address these issues, piloted on an infrastructure programme in the Solomon Islands (funded by the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and managed by SKM) in December 2008. The process involved a series of meetings and a full day workshop with SKM, government and RAMSI representatives. It led to the definition of specific issues and objectives for the programme and the development of an action plan, based on a framework of economic, environmental and social sustainability issues. The process was successful in translating the concept of sustainability into the specific project context (provision of sustainable building infrastructure in the Solomon Islands) and facilitating a shared understanding of what “sustainability” meant to stakeholders, which had not existed before. On this basis, a common action plan was designed to implement the sustainability objectives set jointly during the engagement process.  The identified objectives of good budget planning and asset management, stakeholder co-ordination, capacity-building and community ownership address the key issues highlighted in the World Bank report. The success of the engagement process is clearly demonstrated by large parts of the action plan being adopted by the Solomon Islands Government. Improvements in budget planning and asset management have been instigated and are currently being implemented. Integration of these actions into existing project management processes will lead to better economic, social and environmental outcomes throughout the life of the project and infrastructure.

Abstract: In early 2006, the Victorian Government released the Yarra River Action Plan, which allocated $20 million towards tackling urban stormwater pollution. To ensure this money is allocated in an equitable and transparent manner across all metropolitan local governments a multi-criteria assessment tool has been developed. This paper presents an overview of the multi-criteria assessment tool developed and adopted for selecting structural Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) projects that are eligible for funding through Melbourne Water’s Stormwater Programs. This tool considers three types of indicators: environmental, engagement (engagement with stakeholders and local government capacity building), and financial. Within each category, a series of descriptive indicators of different weightings are applied to score a project: an overall score of 0.45 being required for the project to be accepted. Where initial concept designs do not satisfy this criterion, additional work is undertaken to refine and improve the project. The tool and its use are illustrated with a case study.

Abstract: Initial US efforts to rebuild and rehabilitate Iraq were a failure. This failure was all but guaranteed by the mistaken confidence that senior levels of the US Government held in Iraqi Government capacity. Once the inability of the Iraqi Government to govern was realised, efforts to take over their responsibilities were equally fraught due to a lack of planning and properly skilled personnel. By this time, much critical time had been lost in establishing an effective information management plan, and insurgent propaganda had taken root. Substantial sums of money and prodigious effort were employed to rectify the governance and information problems, but to limited effect due to a further lack of planning. Having identified these problems and learned some difficult lessons, the US V Corps formed an integrated, synchronised “C24” cell at MNF-I, incorporating the C7 (Engineer), C8 (Comptroller) and C9 (Civil Military Operations, or CMO) positions into a “one stop shop” for CMO, synchronising its efforts and shaping all of V Corps into a powerful force for “constructive engagement”. Shortcomings still exist, however, and harnessing the full capabilities of the interagency is the only way to overcome them.

Abstract: Cultural change is often positioned as central to transformation within the Australian Public Service (APS). The ongoing focus on cultural change suggests it has not yet been realised, which is unsurprising, given it is so difficult to change. However, cultural change may also be impeded due to the way it is portrayed within the APS. This article draws on the work of Schein to identify three problems with how organisational culture and cultural change are portrayed in the APS, including the focus on a unified APS culture, the simplistic way in which culture is portrayed, and the general and high-level claims for how to achieve cultural change. It provides three recommendations for how these problems can be addressed, including focusing on high-level principles for conduct across the APS (rather than a unified APS culture), focusing on cultural evolution at the department, agency, and subunit levels, and supporting cultural evolution through establishing mechanisms for behavioural change. Adopting this approach could enable the APS to realise desired changes and enable success of the Albanese Government's APS reform agenda.Points for practitionersCultural change is difficult to achieve due to culture being deeply embedded, underpinned by a stable system of values, beliefs, and assumptions.Change could be realised within the APS through focusing on cultural evolution, rather than cultural change-specifically at the department, agency, and subunit levels where there is some compatibility between existing and desired cultures.Cultural evolution requires the identification of the specific behaviours required for effective change, followed by a reconfiguration of a range of mechanisms required to embed and reinforce behavioural change.Leaders play a central role in facilitating behavioural change and cultural evolution, but doing this effectively may require leadership cognitive shifts; therefore, leaders need support and development.

Abstract: The sustainable urban water management system is likely to be characterised by complex and flexible governance arrangements, increased inter-organisational interaction and wide stakeholder participation, which contrasts significantly with the traditional approach. Recently there has been significant financial investment in urban water reform, however the reforms have not been as successful as anticipated and numerous institutional barriers remain. Understanding and assessing institutional capacity is central to addressing institutional impediments. Institutional capacity comprises individual, intra- and inter-organisational and external rules and incentives capacities. This paper reports on the first case study of a social research project that aims to develop an institutional capacity assessment framework. Empirical data from semi-structured interviews with 59 water industry experts in Sydney, Australia, and a broad literature survey were used. The key capacity attributes identified could form the basis of an institutional capacity assessment tool and reveal common and differing attributes across stakeholder groups which provide insight into stakeholder relations. Synthesis of the results revealed that intra- and inter-organisational capacities were facing particular challenges and should be explicitly addressed in reform, policy and capacity development initiatives.

Abstract: This paper is about the capacity of the federal government in Australia to achieve its stated water management and environmental goals in relation to the Murray-Darling River system via its Murray-Darling Basin Plan of 2012. The paper uses a 'state capacity' approach. One aspect of state capacity is about the state's broad institutional capabilities; these are the ways in which the state's resources and policy instruments, its institutions, and its knowledge and data capabilities can shape the state's capacity to achieve its stated goals. The second aspect is relational, emphasising the notion of 'infrastructural power', or how states might be able to achieve their goals by working cooperatively with major interlocutors in the broader state or in society. These two aspects are typically viewed from a state-centric perspective, with the state depicted as using its broad institutional capacities to help further its relational or infrastructural power over other interlocutors. In contrast, this paper shows how this process has been reversed, and how key interlocutors, including important players in federal and state governments and powerful irrigation interests, have instead drawn resources from and manipulated the key institutional elements of state capacity to suit their own interests, weaken the federal state's infrastructural power, and subvert the stated aims of the Basin Plan.

Abstract: New legislation was introduced in 2018 in Victoria, Australia to encourage the negotiation of affordable housing agreements. This change resulted in the expansion of formal and informal mechanisms for cross-sectoral affordable housing delivery. In this paper we draw on 20 interviews with housing stakeholders, focusing on the process of negotiation. We propose a novel theoretical framework to interpret capacity for collective action in a loosely regulated policy area, combining insights from negotiation theory and Institutional Capacity Development (ICD) literature. We find widespread concerns about the opaque, inefficient and potentially exploitative nature of outcomes. We also find that agreements varied across projects based on levels of trust; access to information; political capital; capacity for mutual gain; and the presence of shared rules for interacting. We conclude that competition-based negotiations may lead to increased institutional capacity while also highlighting the challenges of housing delivery in the context of institutional uncertainty.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the debate on whether or not e-government has the transformational impact on government performance, governance, and public service, as we addressed this very issue at the 2007 ECEG. However, e-government research results on the transformational impact are mixed (Scholl 2005). This may be an apt reflection of either the early stages of e-government development or the newness of e-government research field or both. Our research goal as scholars of e-government must be to penetrate appearances to ascertain whatever lessons and meanings might lie beneath. This paper is an initial attempt toward achieving this goal. The main objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between public service reform through e-government and actual government performance. We achieve this objective through a case study of Japan's National Tax Agency (NTA) and its launch of transactional e-government initiative: "e-Tax" - an online income tax returns filing and payment service for individuals and corporations. A preliminary case analysis provides evidence in support of the transformational impact of e-Tax on NTA performance (e.g. tax administration efficiency gains) and public service (e.g. process reform). This paper makes an important contribution to the growing e-government research literature on the transformational impact of e-government particularly on service process reform.

Abstract: In October 2012, Australia's parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that a mediation support unit should be created within the Australian Agency for International Development, a department now amalgamated with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The question is: Does Australia possess the motivation and capacity to implement active and effective international mediation by building the capacity of intermediaries to deploy various peacemaking methods to hasten de-escalation at different stages of a conflict? If not, is a mediation support unit an appropriate initiative to address this capability gap? This article draws on quantitative conflict data sets and an expert panel to conclude that Australia's track record demonstrates significant capacity to undertake international mediation, but that the mediation personnel and processes available to government are insufficiently resourced and coordinated to readily provide policymakers with accessible tools to undertake the diverse range of mediation strategies advocated by conflict scholars. While a mediation support unit would address some of these issues, at present it conflicts with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's institutional philosophy based on diffused expertise.

Abstract: Classical organizational management literature draws clear parallels between organizational culture and climate and effective use of power and influence as key to successful policy implementation of reforms in public sector organizations. On the other hand, the public policy literature, in particular, policy transfer as a strand within policy studies, emphasizes the role of the national context, more specifically, 'facilitators' and 'constraints' of ''politico-administrative culture" within the national context, as crucial to understanding processes of transfer, convergence, and diffusion of public policy. There is a plethora of studies by Western scholars of public management who have successfully utilized these theoretical underpinnings to study the effectiveness of public service reforms in mature policy environments such as the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand, and others. However, the public policy and comparative public management literature only offers a limited number of case studies from developing, middle-/upper-middle countries, which rely on concepts of organizational management in addition to narratives on the impact of policy learning from global doctrines, such as Weberianism, New Public Management (NPM), and New Public Governance (NPG), and national politics, on the implementation of administrative reforms in those contexts. Kazakhstan, as a resource-affluent post-Soviet country and a bastion of modernization and 'open government' in Central Asia or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the post-Soviet era is a case in point. Based on ethnographic research consisting of interviews with elite academics, civil servants, and think-tank activists, as well as reviews of OECD and government strategy reports in Astana, the findings point to a potential abatement of the impact of context constraints such as large power distance and collectivist behavior by context facilitators such as those surrounding the use of 'trilingualism' and public diplomacy towards reforms in Kazakhstan particularly in recent years.

Abstract: Administrative staff are a crucial human capital input in tertiary education institutions. Given the substantial investment in recruitment and selection of administrative staff, efficient and effective use of these staff affects the organisational and financial performance of universities. Whereas much concern has been placed on the performance of academic staff, the ability of a university to obtain an optimal level of administrative staff has not been addressed. This paper investigates whether the usage capacity of administrative staff is maximised in Vietnamese universities. Vietnam has implemented several education reform policies with the aim to improve the standing of its universities in the world's education market. The process is not only about obtaining and delivering good education quality, but also efficiently using human resources to reach optimal performance and sustainable development. Employing the stochastic frontier input requirement model with data on 112 Vietnamese universities, we examine the presence of excess administrative capacity in these universities, given the existing student outputs and other input resources. We find that, on average, the level of excess administrative capacity is 3.4%, implying an economic loss in universities. In addition, under the analysis of determinants of the variances of the inefficiency effects and the error terms in the input-requirement function, our findings reveal that excess administrative capacity varies according to location and ownership. Some policy implications are discussed to address excess capacity of administrative staff in the Vietnamese context and some key lessons learned for the rest of the world.

Abstract: This article examines recent debate over core or 'independent' integrity institutions in the Victorian and Commonwealth governments to highlight some of the need, and potential, for more careful deliberation over options for building the capacity of integrity systems - the second of the analytical themes used in Australia's national assessment. The first part compares resourcing of major integrity institutions by Australian governments over the past 15 years. Staffing and finances are seen as a useful basic measure of capacity, helping lift attention away from the assumption that creation of new bodies necessarily increases capacity. The data also show that some jurisdictions-including Victoria-may yet have some way to go if they wish to match other governments. The second part of the analysis identifies eight further issues for consideration in deliberations on institutional design. Our conclusion is that by working through such issues more systematically, it may be possible to identify new or different institutional options for configuring integrity resources. This could help avoid inappropriate choices-whether unnecessary new bodies, overloads on existing ones or the import of frameworks that do not necessarily 'fit' local conditions-of particular relevance to current proposals for a new Commonwealth anti-corruption agency.

Abstract: This research investigates the value of teaching philosophies (TP) for today's academics and their institutions. It offers a new framework to enhance academic development, personal resilience, and institutional capacity building. Since the 1990s, TPs have been formalised as personally constructed and reflectively written statements of educational values, beliefs, and practices. Whereas within universities, TPs have been institutionalised for academic performance reviews, awards, and promotions. In-depth personal interviews on TPs and their value on personal journeys and institutional experiences were conducted with academics from Australia and Canada. The findings highlight the value and future potential of TPs beyond a formulaic role.

Abstract: Upgrading is among the most effective interventions to address urban poverty, but weaknesses include outdated conceptual frameworks informing project design, and ineffective management by governance institutions. This paper examines the ingredients that need to be put in place during upgrading to ensure the continuity of the settlement improvement process. The paper is divided into three sections. The first section introduces urban upgrading, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The second section then describes the growth of Barangay Commonwealth in Metro Manila and the characteristics of the settlement. The following section introduces the institutional capacity building framework, outlining the activities necessary to ensure longer-term improvement of low-income settlements. The section then examines physical, environmental, social, economic and institutional dimensions of the upgrading of the settlement that have taken place over the last 75 years. The concluding section examines areas that need attention in order to continue the process of building the institutional capacity that will ensure the longer-teen continuity of the improvement of Barangay Commonwealth.

Abstract: The lack of studies that examined the influence of government effectiveness on environmental pollution and whether it formulates the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis motivated this research. Therefore, this research examines the role of government effectiveness on CO2 emission in 170 countries. To achieve the research aims, the system generalized method of moment model is applied while categorizing the countries into three groups: namely high, moderate, and low government effectiveness countries. The major results of this research revealed that government effectiveness reduces CO2 emission significantly in the overall sample, high and the moderate government effectiveness countries while it is not significant in the low government effectiveness countries. Moreover, the EKC hypothesis is present in the overall sample high and moderate government effectiveness countries while the hypothesis does not exist in the low government effectiveness countries. Therefore, the outcome of this research shows clearly that effectiveness of the government in terms of independence from political pressures, the quality of policy preparation and application, and the reliability of the government's commitment to such policies is an important element that determines the EKC hypothesis. From the outcome of this research, a number of policy implications were provided for the investigated countries.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited a wide range of national responses with an even wider range of outcomes in terms of infections and mortalities. Australia is a rare success story, keeping deaths comparatively low, and infections too, until the Omicron wave. What explains Australia's success? Typical explanations emphasise leaders' choices. We agree, but argue that leaders' choices, and whether these are implemented effectively, is shaped by the legacy of state transformation. Decades of neo-liberal reforms have hollowed out state capacity and confused lines of control and accountability, leaving Australia unprepared for the pandemic. Leaders thus abandoned plans and turned to ad hoc, simple to implement emergency measures - border closures and lockdowns. These averted large-scale outbreaks and deaths, but with diminishing returns as the Delta variant took hold. Conversely, Australia's regulatory state has struggled to deliver more sophisticated policy responses, even when leaders were apparently committed, including an effective quarantine system, crucial for border controls, and vaccination programme, essential for exiting the quagmire of lockdowns and closed borders, leading to a partial return to top-down governing. The Australian experience shows that to avoid a public health catastrophe or more damaging lockdowns in the next pandemic, states must re-learn to govern.

Abstract: Previous studies find that adopting Freedom of Information (FOI) laws increase reporting of corruption, as this facilitates the right of access to governmental information. Thus, it is argued that FOI laws increase transparency and enhance government accountability. However, whether or not adopting such transparency laws improves bureaucratic efficiency remains unexplored. We provide first quantitative evidence on the impact of FOI laws on bureaucratic efficiency. Using panel data on 132 countries from 1990 to 2011, we find that adopting FOI laws, and in particular 'stronger' FOI laws, is associated with an improvement in bureaucratic efficiency, after controlling for self-section bias. FOI laws appear to be more effective in the long run, and if combined with a higher degree of media freedom, presence of non-governmental organization activism, and political competition. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity using instrumental variables, alternative samples, and estimation methods.

Abstract: Building a national system of social governance (guojia zhili tixi), which is the long-running governance dream of Xi Jinping, has triggered the creation of China's 'smart state' using the tools of new information technologies to advance governance capacity (zhili nengli). These systems were already deployed nationally when the COVID-19 pandemic hit China, but were connected at a lesser capacity, targeting specific domains of security, industry or government administration. In response to the crisis, multiple technologies have been merged, exceeding the scope of their originally intended functions. This is known as function creep, when surveillant technologies remain functional past achievement of their intended purpose, or surveillant assemblages, where multiple surveillant technologies are combined. As more countries turn to digitalisation to increase public security and intensify social and market governance, the expansion of surveillant functions in China and their now-palpable effects on people's lives raises new and pressing questions for scholars and decision-makers alike.

Abstract: The national-level data extracted from the World Bank, Transparency International, and the United Nations databases were analysed in this study to examine the contribution of e-participation in improving governance factors through its influence on corruption, voice and accountability, and government effectiveness. The analysis has provided a mixed outcome in improving governance through e-participation, showing a significant relationship between e-participation and corruption-perception, and government effectiveness. Meanwhile, the relationships between e-participation and voice and accountability are insignificant. This finding indicates that the present form of e-participation in ensuring citizens' voices for holding service providers accountable may have some limitations. The findings have implications for international organisations and government institutions to redesign their e-participation methods and tools to warrant citizens' voice and ensure accountability of service providers at the national level.

Abstract: The last decade has seen increasing attention to institutional arrangements and policy outcomes affecting the governance of the world's seas and oceans. Governance is linked to institutional capacity and to the effectiveness of public organizations drawing attention to tools and approaches underpinning effective and efficient institutional arrangements. Australia has taken a high profile in oceans governance, with international actions matched by the development of a number of national initiatives including a national Oceans Policy. Australia has numerous laws and policy instruments addressing aspects of the management of the marine environment, reflecting the federal nature of this policy area where responsibility is shared between the Commonwealth (federal or Australian) government and Australian state and territory governments. The Oceans Policy, implemented by the Commonwealth and applied within Commonwealth jurisdiction, has been a major initiative but its implementation highlights a number of challenges. This article outlines Australia's approach to ocean governance and assesses, through reference to the concept of effectiveness, current governance arrangements integral to the Oceans Policy.

Abstract: This paper examines an attempt to build capacity and empower local institutions in war-torn Jaffna,, on the northern tip of Sri Lanka. A participatory approach that is aimed at social empowerment is seen to be possible even under the most restrictive of political environments. However, whether or not the development intervention provides a foundation for longer-term improvement depends on the extent to which institutional capacity is built. Through an examination of the Jaffna Reconstruction Project, it is argued that if any of the ingredients of this institutional capacity are missing, not only will the 'islands of participation and empowerment' that are built by the development initiative be short-lived, but there may also be a negligible contribution to building a foundation for longer-term improvement in quality of life.

Abstract: Purpose The "resource curse phenomenon" has received a lot of attention from researchers; however, there has not been any sound explanation to back this phenomenon since the main reason why natural resource should restrain economic growth instead of boosting economic growth remains unanswered. This paper contributes to literature on "resource curse hypothesis" by examining the role of government effectiveness in influencing the impact of gas resource rent on economic growth. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted the Cobb-Douglass production and incorporated gas resource rent, institutional quality (government effectiveness), inflation and exchange rate as additional variables that influences total output (gross domestic product). The author estimated the empirical form of the Cobb-Douglass production using autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) and Toda and Yamamoto (1995) as the main estimation strategies while other time series approaches were used as a robustness check. Findings The estimates from the ARDL short-run and the long-run dynamics suggest that the direct impact of gas resource rent on economic growth was positive but not statistically significant. At the same time, the interacting of gas resource rent and government effectiveness showed a positive and statistically significant effect of nearly 0.4123 and 0.8724 on economic growth in the long run and short run, respectively. The results from the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) also indicated that economic growth has a strong influence on gas resource rent while government effectiveness drives economic growth and not vice versa. Research limitations/implications The findings from this study imply that government effectiveness plays a crucial role in averting the "resource curse phenomenon". Hence, improving government effectiveness and efficiency through minimizing corruption among state institutions would be imperative in curbing the "resource curse phenomenon" in developing countries. Originality/value The influential role of government effectiveness on the relationship between gas resource rent on economic growth is examined.

Abstract: The expanding provision of affordable housing by non-profit community housing organisations, coupled with possibilities of substantial stock transfer from State Housing Authorities, suggest Australia's social housing sector may be entering a transformative phase. Based on a review of restructuring in Britain, where over the last 25 years, traditionally owned and managed 'council housing' has been reduced from over 90 per cent to less than 30 per cent of overall social housing stock, this article considers possible policy implications for Australia. In particular, it analyses British experience which could inform Australian decisions on organisational size, institutional vehicles and governance structures within the context of the future programme of stock transfers envisaged by many commentators on the Australian housing scene.

Abstract: We develop a state capacity framework to account for different national responses to Covid-19. Our starting point is the influential idea that neoliberalism has a major role to play in state failure to control the pandemic. By implementing neoliberal reforms, states have ostensibly rendered themselves incapable of preventing or mitigating the viral outbreak. A focus on the British experience lends weight to this perspective. But when viewed in a comparative light, the picture is less straightforward. By comparing the British and Australian cases, we see a similar embrace of neoliberal reforms across the whole of government, yet with strikingly divergent outcomes. How can we account for this dramatic difference? To answer this question, we offer an enhanced state capacity framework to improve our understanding of diverse national responses to Covid-19. Our larger objective is to enrich the existing state capacity literature in two ways. First, we extend the existing state capacity framework by introducing a new category - salutary capacity - to encapsulate a state's ability to correct and counteract the course of a national health emergency. Second, we introduce the idea of political choice to emphasise the importance of agency in offsetting the institutional weaknesses associated with neoliberal reform.

Abstract: Electricity is a vital factor underlying modern living standards, but there are many developing countries with low levels of electricity access and use. We seek to systematically identify the crucial elements underlying transitions toward greater electrification in developing countries. We use a cross-sectional regression approach with national-level data up to 2012 for 135 low-and middle-income countries. The paper finds that the effectiveness of governments is the most important governance attribute for encouraging the transition to increased electrification in developing countries, on average. The results add to the growing evidence on the importance of governance for development outcomes. Donors seeking to make more successful contributions to electrification may wish to target countries with more effective governments.

Abstract: This paper explores how state capacity in the sense of controlling tax evasion affects wage inequality through constructing several general equilibrium models. We analyse six types of redistribution in urban areas, and find that effect variations in urban wage inequality arise depending on the specific recipients of redistribution. Notably, under redistribution to urban unskilled labour, changes in wage inequality will depend on the capital intensity of the urban skilled sector when state capacity increases.

Abstract: We study the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization in a federation. Regional governments are characterized by their abilities to deliver public goods (administrative capacity) and to raise tax revenues (fiscal capacity). Two regimes are compared on efficiency grounds. Under partial decentralization, regional governments rely on central bailouts to complete local projects in financing needs. Under full decentralization, marginal financing is achieved via local capital taxes. We show that the presence of sufficiently low levels of administrative capacity is a necessary condition for full decentralization dominance. This condition may also be sufficient, depending on the projects' characteristics. Some extensions are presented.

Abstract: This paper reports the results of an empirical investigation into the relationships between public social spending, government effectiveness, and economic growth. Using panel data covering 132 developed and developing countries over the 2008 to 2019 period, we find significant and complementary relationships among the variables through fixed effects, system GMM, and instrumental variable estimation. All three components of public social spending, including social security benefits, education expenditure, and health expenditure, have a significant and positive impact on subsequent economic growth. Government effectiveness has a direct growth-enhancing effect as well as a mediating and positive effect on the association between public social expenditures and economic growth. Thus, governments accelerate the positive impact of public social spending on economic growth. These relationships hold for countries at all income levels, while the channels predicting a positive social spending - growth relationship are stronger in high-income countries than lower-income countries. To stimulate inclusive growth, governments must actively design and implement social spending policies. These, however, should be complemented by concomitant efforts to strengthen the quality of public institutions, which exerts a substantial impact on the social spending - growth relationship.

Abstract: Recognising both the importance of intertidal wetlands and their role in mosquito-borne disease we discuss wise management to conserve wetland values and to reduce vector borne disease health risks. First we summarise the mosquito-borne diseases associated with intertidal wetlands in sub-tropical and tropical Australia. We consider the Ramsar Strategic Plan, its reflection in some key Australian statutes and the relationship between environment-focussed legislation and health legislation. This is followed by a brief overview of mosquito control and its impact on human health. Using a salt marsh example of an integrated process, we describe the development of what was, in the 1980s in Australia, a novel method of habitat modification (runnelling) for mosquito control. Runnelling modifies the tidal water flow on salt marshes, reducing mosquito larval numbers and minimising environmental impacts. The approach is related to two of the Ramsar goals (wise use and institutional capacity and effectiveness). We then describe the extension of its rationale to a complex mangrove system. Finally, with a concept model, we consider the convergence between minimal habitat modification for wetland conservation and human health protection using an interdisicplinary approach involving multiple stakeholders.

Abstract: Carbon neutrality is a 21st-century priority area, with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries making significant investments in renewable energy and climate mitigation initiatives to attain it. However, carbon neutrality research in the MENA region is under-developed, particularly when considering the roles of renewable energy, economic growth, and effectiveness of government. To address this gap, this research investigates the roles of renewable energy, economic growth, and government effectiveness toward the MENA region's carbon neutrality goal. We implemented heterogeneous and second-generation panel data techniques that are resilient to cross-sectional dependency and slope heterogeneity to panel data spanning 16 MENA countries from 1996 to 2018. We discovered that MENA data are cross-sectionally dependent, heterogeneous, and cointegrated. We found that government effectiveness and renewable energy bring carbon neutrality closer, but economic growth initially delays it. We detected Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in the MENA region, specifically in the High-Income Countries. Although there were signs of EKC in the Middle-Income Countries, this was not significantly validated. Finally, we found a one-way causal link from government effectiveness and renewable energy to carbon neutrality but a feedback mechanism between economic growth and carbon neutrality in the MENA region. As a result of these findings, it is recommended that the MENA region's policymakers prioritize renewable energies and improve the effectiveness of government to drive economic growth toward the carbon neutrality goal.

Abstract: Using an index of corporate governance quality (CGQ), we provide the first robust evidence of the determinants of stock liquidity in Australia. We assume that CGQ affects stock liquidity because effective governance decreases information asymmetries between insiders (e.g. managers) and outsiders (e.g. investors), as well as among outsiders, by improving information transparency of a firm. Consistent with agency theory, this study, using 435 large capitalization firms over the period from 2001 to 2008, finds a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have a higher level of stock liquidity. These findings are robust to alternative proxies of CGQ, stock liquidity and endogeneity bias.

The experience of these senior managers and policy workers is then reinterpreted in terms of a nodal governance model. The findings from the Australian study on policy capacity, interpreted in the context of nodal governance, is then used to discuss the features of "governance capacity" as articulated in the matrix model of policy capacity developed by Wu, Ramesh and Howlett (2015). The article concludes with propositions for strengthening policy capacity across the governance regime so depicted. These include: capacity building for individuals at various key locations in the network; organisational capacity building within the organisations and across their key relationships; and reforms across the governance network as a whole.

Abstract: Background: Evidence-informed decision-making for health is far from the norm, particularly in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Health policy and systems research (HPSR) has an important role in providing the context-sensitive and -relevant evidence that is needed. However, there remain significant challenges both on the supply side, in terms of capacity for generation of policy-relevant knowledge such as HPSR, and on the demand side in terms of the demand for and use of evidence for policy decisions. This paper brings together elements from both sides to analyse institutional capacity for the generation of HPSR and the use of evidence (including HPSR) more broadly in LMICs. Methods: The paper uses literature review methods and two survey instruments (directed at research institutions and Ministries of Health, respectively) to explore the types of institutional support required to enhance the generation and use of evidence. Results: Findings from the survey of research institutions identified the absence of core funding, the lack of definitional clarity and academic incentive structures for HPSR as significant constraints. On the other hand, the survey of Ministries of Health identified a lack of locally relevant evidence, poor presentation of research findings and low institutional prioritisation of evidence use as significant constraints to evidence uptake. In contrast, improved communication between researchers and decision-makers and increased availability of relevant evidence were identified as facilitators of evidence uptake. Conclusion: The findings make a case for institutional arrangements in research that provide support for career development, collaboration and cross-learning for researchers, as well as the setting up of institutional arrangements and processes to incentivise the use of evidence among Ministries of Health and other decision-making institutions. The paper ends with a series of recommendations to build institutional capacity in HPSR through engaging multiple stakeholders in identifying and maintaining incentive structures, improving research (including HPSR) training, and developing stronger tools for synthesising non-traditional forms of local, policy-relevant evidence such as grey literature. Addressing challenges on both the supply and demand side can build institutional capacity in the research and policy worlds and support the enhanced uptake of high quality evidence in policy decisions.

Abstract: PurposeAgeing is a global concern that poses many challenges for governments, particularly in relation to the pressing issue of how to provide adequate social protection for the increasing number of elderly. Alongside rapid social and demographic transformation, Indonesia is especially challenged by the increasing number of elderly in need of formal care that is stretching the capacities of government and necessitates improvements in the social protection system. This study examines governance capacity in nursing homes and offers recommendations for improving the social protection system.Design/methodology/approachThe research presents a qualitative case study of government aged care centres in East Java and the experiences of residents and staff of three centres managed by the Provincial Social Service of East Java. The case study is based on ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured interviews with 32 informants comprising directors, managers, staff and elderly residents of nursing homes.FindingsThe research finds that while social protection is in place, governance capacities at the provincial and local level are thinly stretched. The research highlights the tensions between existent governance capacities - in terms of mobility, decision-making, implementation and established local structures of governance and management - and the inability to meet the increasing demands for government elder care services and resources amidst broader societal transformations such as shifts in cultural framing of familial care of elderly. The findings point to the importance of understanding the dynamic relationship between governance capacity and the shifting terrains of elderly care due to societal transformation.Originality/valueThe research brings attention to the pivotal role that governance capacity plays in shaping the experiences and challenges of local government level elder care provision and the growing need for elder care in the face of an ageing population and shifts in kinship and family elder care arrangements. Elder care is not simply about addressing basic needs but also the quality and dignity of elderly and this is not easy to address where social protection systems are stretched beyond capacity. Recommendations are provided for enhancing government policy and expanding the scope for building cross-sectorial partnerships.

Abstract: Global and national strategy emphasises land use planning as a key mechanism for disaster risk reduction (DRR). The practice of planning for natural hazards is devolved to local levels, making the capacity of local government critical for achieving strategic DRR goals. This study assessed the capacity of local governments in Australia to plan for natural hazards. Many Local Government Areas (LGAs) had satisfactory or good hazard planning provision, but remoteness, land area and council size influence poor hazard planning provision. Strategic intent for land use planning as a DRR mechanism is unlikely to be successful in many LGAs without first addressing place-based capacity constraints on hazard planning.

Abstract: Given the increasing importance attached to both corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate governance, this study investigates the association between these two complimentary mechanisms used by companies to enhance relations with stakeholders. Consistent with both legitimacy and stakeholder theory and controlling for industry profile, firm size, stockholder power/dispersion, creditor power/leverage, and economic performance, our analysis of the annual reports for a sample of 222 listed companies suggests that firms providing more CSR information: have better corporate governance ratings; are larger; belong to higher profile industries; and are more highly leveraged. Our findings support the limited prior research suggesting a link between corporate governance quality and CSR disclosure in company annual reports and suggest that, rather than mandating specific disclosures, regulators might be better served focussing on corporate governance quality as a way of increasing CSR disclosures.

Abstract: Ecological modernisation (EM), in theory and practice, has increasingly become central to contemporary state environmental reform agendas. EM's allure lies in its central tenet that the contemporary institutions of capitalism can be ecologically adapted to achieve 'win-win' economic and environmental outcomes. How government policy can best accomplish this aim is contested, however, with weak and strong EM approaches advocating different roles for the state in facilitating ecological restructuring. The latter approaches argue that for EM processes to be successful, state intervention via ecological industrial policy is required. This article makes a unique contribution to the industry policy and EM debate by assessing the manner in which EM was conceptualised and implemented within the Australian government's automotive industry policy between 2007 and 2013. This analysis raises issues about the institutional capacity of states to pursue either weak or strong forms of EM.

Abstract: This paper presents new archival evidence about the amount and structure of central government disaster relief during China's devastating flood of 1823. The flood affected 20 per cent of China's counties, and spending per capita was sizable and distributed between provinces depending on the intensity of flooding. Because of its relative small size and limited state capacity, the Chinese government ultimately spent about half of its annual tax revenues on relief during 1823. Given China's ensuing secular economic stagnation, this is consistent with models emphasising state capacity for economic growth.

Abstract: In the post-Cold War era, a voluminous literature has developed to define failed states, identify the causes and parameters of failure, and devise ways for dealing with the problems associated with state fragility and failure. While there is some theoretical diversity within this literature-notably between neoliberal institutionalists and neo-Weberian institutionalists-state failure is commonly defined in terms of state capacity. Since capacity is conceived in technical and 'objective' terms, the political nature of projects of state construction (and reconstruction) is masked. Whereas the existence of social and political struggles of various types is often recognized by the failed states literature, these conflicts are abstracted from political and social institutions. Such an analysis then extends into programmes that attempt to build state capacity as part of projects that seek to manage social and political conflict. Ascertaining which interests are involved and which interests are left out in such processes is essential for any understanding of the prospects or otherwise of conflict resolution.

Abstract: This paper extends prior research on the relationship between governance quality and auditor remuneration. We examine the influence of audit committee effectiveness (ACE), a proxy for governance quality, on audit fees (AF) and non-audit services fees (NASF) using a new composite measure comprising audit committee independence, expertise, diligence and size. We find that after controlling for board of director characteristics, there is a significant positive association between ACE and AF only for larger clients. Our results indicate that effective audit committees undertake more monitoring which results in wider audit scope and higher audit fees. Contrary to our expectations, we find the association between ACE and NASF to be positive and significant, especially for larger clients. This suggests that larger clients are more likely to purchase non-audit services (NAS) even in the presence of effective audit committees probably due to the complexity of their activities. Overall, our findings support regulatory initiatives aimed at improving corporate governance quality.

Abstract: 'Twinning' is the distinctive method employed during the last two decades by the Swedish International Development Go-operation Agency (Sida) to promote institutional capacity building in development co-operation. This article reports on a study undertaken to provide evidence which would help Sida to make judgements about the efficacy of the twinning model as a basis for sustainable capacity building, and to explore ways of enhancing the method. The study indicates that the twinning method has potential advantages over other modes of development co-operation, particularly that it offers enhanced possibilities for organizational learning and sustainable capacity building. However, the study suggests that this potential is not being fully exploited. Twinning arrangements have produced major benefits in professional/technical upgrading, but there is less evidence of outcomes at the level of sustainable institutional capacity building. Contrary to Sida's expectations of its distinctive advantages, in operation, twinning tends to become a rather routine process, viewed by developing country partners as an unexceptional way of delivering aid which presents few fundamental challenges and provides essentially the same benefits as alternative methods. It appears that institutional development and organizational learning are generally not issues of major significance for partner organizations in twinning arrangements. Even at the individual level the focus is on training rather than learning, which results in the usual emphasis on formal off-job training rather than seeking opportunities for learning from work. The article presents ideas on how the current twinning approach might be renovated, and considers how agencies such as Sida might enhance their development co-operation in the realm of governance by moving beyond twinning.

Abstract: We compare Australian and New Zealand parliamentary demands on executive governments to 'do something' about globalisation, noting that parliaments are distinctive institutionally-functioning as umbrellas protecting arenas of adversarial competitiveness, with little scope for cohesive institutional capacity. We define 'globalisation' as it is defined by the parliamentary actors themselves: that is, quite broadly with different actors taking different postures towards globalisation depending on party and on political and institutional perspectives. Whether parliaments can respond effectively to globalisation depends on their institutional capacity and political composition-their political resources. We establish the international context in which the two parliaments operate, establishing our hypotheses about institutional capacity from Lisa Martin's book Democratic Commitments: Legislatures and International Cooperation. We conclude that both parliaments have made significant, if often unnoticed, contributions to the political management of globalisation.

Abstract: We develop country-level governance indices using governance risk factors and examine whether country-level governance can predict stock market returns. We find that country-level governance predicts stock market returns only in countries where governance quality is poor. For countries with well-developed governance, there is no evidence that governance predicts returns. Our findings also confirm that investors in countries with weak governance can utilise information contained in country-level governance indicators to devise profitable portfolio strategies.

Abstract: This paper explores sovereign risk preferences against direct and indirect natural disasters losses in industrialized countries. Using Australia as a case study, the analysis compares expected disaster losses and government capacity to finance losses. Utilizing a national disaster loss dataset, extreme value theory is applied to estimate an all-hazard annual loss distribution. Unusually but critically, the dataset includes direct as well as indirect losses, allowing for the analysis to consider the oft-ignored issue of indirect losses. Expected annual losses (direct, and direct plus indirect) are overlaid with a risk-layer approach, to distinguish low, medium and extreme loss events. Each risk layer is compared to available fiscal resources for financing losses, grounded in the political reality of Australian disaster financing. When considering direct losses only, we find support for a risk-neutral preference on the part of the Australian government for low and medium loss levels, and a risk-averse preference in regard to extreme losses. When indirect losses are also estimated, we find that even medium loss levels are expected to overwhelm available fiscal resources, thereby violating the available resources assumption underlying arguments for sovereign risk neutrality. Our analysis provides empirical support for the assertion that indirect losses are a major, under-recognised concern for industrialized countries. A risk-averse preference in regard to medium and extreme loss events recommends enhanced investment in both corrective and prospective risk reduction in relation to these risks level, in particular to reduce indirect losses.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of corporate governance quality on audit quality in Malaysia. The sampling frame is 457 Malaysian non-finance listed companies, over the periods 2003 to 2007 (pre-2007 Code period) and 2008 to 2012 (post-2007 Code period), consisting of 2,285 observations for each period. This study uses pooled ordinary least square (OLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. The results show that the effectiveness of the audit committee (AC) has no significant influence on audit fees in the pre-and post-2007 Code period, and the effectiveness of the board has no significant influence on audit fees in the pre-2007 Code period, although it has significant influence on audit fees in the post-2007 Code period. The results suggest that the existing corporate governance framework in relation to AC has limitation in its governance role on audit process. Our study contributes to existing literature conducted in the US, the UK and Australia where their institutional settings are different from that of Malaysia. In addition, our study is based on the 2007 Code's recommendation which contributes to the previous research conducted in Malaysia and provides an insightful evidence to the regulator on the corporate governance regime in Malaysia.

Abstract: To generate innovative solutions for marine sustainability challenges, scientists, policymakers, and funders are increasingly calling for interdisciplinary research that transcends disciplinary boundaries. However, challenges associated with doing interdisciplinary research persist and undermine progress toward tackling the complex challenges faced by marine social-ecological systems. One barrier for engaging in effective interdisciplinary research is a lack of understanding about the institutional capacities that support interdisciplinary knowledge production. Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with members of the Centre for Marine Socioecology in Australia, we identify five principles that underpin effective interdisciplinary research organizations. The principles are: (1) support female leadership; (2) forge partnerships outside of academia; (3) develop impact-based performance metrics; (4) focus on long-term funding; and (5) cultivate a visible brand. Going forward, these principles could be used to inform organizational design that transforms institutional barriers into enablers of innovative interdisciplinary research for more sustainable, desirable, and equitable futures.

Abstract: In the wake of new public management, and with the emergence of new public governance, a number of challenges remain unsolved in the field of public service governance and management. In this paper, we use the example of the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme to show how we might deal with the design and implementation of a public service reform within the context of new public governance. We argue that governments need to develop greater openness to risk and policy experimentation during implementation. We therefore propose an adaptive system architecture that could support such risk taking.

Abstract: Since World War Two, the role of non-profit think tanks in the United States has grown and diversified. Today, the United States' government and Congress is advised on many matters of policy-making and implementation by such think tanks. The Westminster system of parliament, as practised in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, has rarely provided a fertile ground for the creation and sustained existence of such privately operated institutions. Despite limited links with similar United States' organizations, the seeds have never really flourished outside the United States of America. Australian Commonwealth governments have been most antagonistic in this regard. On the other hand, management consulting companies, many of which have headquarters in the United States, lobbyists, and corporate representation flourish in the quasi-corporatist political environment carefully constructed by the Australian Labor party (ALP) government since 1983. Policy-related research divisions and statutory authorities have likewise grown in size and importance within the departmental agencies of government itself. Energy, agriculture, immigration, and social service research ''arms'' have been encouraged within the ministerial arena of policy analysis and advice. Especially important has been micro and macro-economic research, urban and infrastructural planning, the Industry Commission, and the Bureau of Industry Economics, respectively. This paper will analyse the growth of these specialized forms of government think tanks, study the range of their ministerial advice, and speculate about their changing role in an increasingly ''managerialist'' type of Westminster-style parliamentary setting.

Abstract: The paper re-examines the role of the state in economic change in colonial India (1757-1947), by paying attention to fiscal capacity. This capacity was larger than that of the precolonial states, and based on different foundations, such as centralisation of finance and securitisation of public debt. Nevertheless, the effort to raise finance hit a barrier, which had owed to the separation of debt from revenue operations. Did the barrier matter? By keeping markets open, the colonial state served private enterprise, but its failure to sustain growth in fiscal capacity compromised public investment in infrastructure and social development.

Abstract: It is often claimed that proportional representation (PR) undermines government effectiveness, including decisional efficacy, fiscal prudence, electoral responsiveness and accountability. Drawing on New Zealand's experience since the introduction of a mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system in 1996, this article examines the impact of the new voting system on government effectiveness. Although government durability has been substantially reduced and the policy-making process has become more complex, governments under MMP appear to be no less able to address major policy problems or respond to changing economic circumstances. Moreover, New Zealand has maintained continuous fiscal surpluses under MMP - a radical departure from the protracted, and often large, deficits that characterised the previous two decades under a majoritarian electoral system.

Abstract: The Auditor General's performance audit into the failings of the Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program has led to a ministerial resignation and a parliamentary inquiry. The media melee prompted by the 'sports rorts' affair has focussed on political corruption of process, with a concentration on the role of ministerial advisers. This is only part of the story. This article argues that on this occasion the Australian Public Service (APS) did not acquit itself well, and that the affair was triggered by an administrative failure to advise on threshold legal and procedural issues: what is termed the 'traffic light' role of a professional public service. The article considers how such policy advice failings may have occurred, and whether APS performance in this instance is an indicator of declining institutional capacity.

Abstract: We examine the effect of stock liquidity and corporate governance on the firm's leverage decision in the order-driven stock trading system and less stringent governance environment of Australia. Using a sample of 1207 non-financial firms from 2001 to 2013, resulting in 9855 firm-year observations, we find the posited negative stock liquidity-leverage relation, confirming prior research observations that firms with more liquid stocks are significantly less leveraged. We also find a significant and negative relation between corporate governance quality (CGQ) and leverage, indicating that firms with high CGQ significantly reduce leverage. In a closer analysis, we find that the significantly negative CGQ-leverage relation exists only for firms with high stock liquidity and does not exist for firms with low stock liquidity. Our study is the first to examine such an interactive relationship among stock liquidity, corporate governance and leverage. The results, which are robust to a range of alternative proxies and to additional tests, provide new insights into the determinants of leverage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As cities confront increasingly complex governance problems, conceptions of urban governance are becoming progressively more receptive to grasping its dynamic and multiplex nature, its connection to multiple lines of authority and forms of power, and the socio-material assemblages through which it works. Yet, despite conceptual advances around the dynamism and heterogeneity of urban governing assemblages and their durability, much remains to be understood about the processes and devices that compose and cohere their constituent elements to generate governance capacity. We explore this limitation by deploying Foucault's concept of 'dispositif' to analytically characterize how urban governance capacity is achieved around complex urban problems via processes and devices of composition and cohering. We do so by examining an emergent urban energy governance dispositif focused around top-tier commercial office space in Sydney, Australia: a key site around which multiple elements have been composed in a complex, entangled dispositif to produce effective urban governance capacity and accomplish substantive gains in office building energy performance. We characterise the socio-material elements involved and, more particularly, identify and analyse the processes and devices that compose the dispositif and cohere its governance capacity and we draw out the diverse forms of power that are immanent in these processes. These are, we argue, key steps in refining systematic understandings of the contemporary functioning and politics of the distributed urban governance of complex urban challenges. We conclude with key observations suggested by our analysis for urban governance scholarship.

Abstract: As transnational programs are often advocated as a knowledge transfer opportunity between the partner universities, this case study investigated the knowledge transfer (KT) processes between Indonesian and Australian universities through an undergraduate transnational program partnership (TPP). An inter-organisational KT theoretical framework from the business sector was adapted and used to guide the study. The data were generated through semi-structured interviews with key university officers and document analysis from two partner universities. Based on the thematic analysis of the data, the findings demonstrated that the curriculum mapping process facilitated KT. However, different intentions of the partner universities in establishing the program led to declining interest to conduct more KT when expectations were not met. The Indonesian university's existing knowledge, acquired from other sources through processes that were serendipitous and based on individual lecturers' personal experience, meant that KT opportunities through the TPP were not always pursued despite written agreement to exchange knowledge with the Australian partner. While KT most evidently resulted in institutional capacity development for the Indonesian university's school that managed the TPP, dissemination of knowledge to other units within the university was more challenging due to communication problems between the units. Hence, other universities seeking to conduct KT through TPPs need to understand each partner university's intention in establishing the partnerships, identify the institutions' needs before seeking knowledge input from the partner university and improve the communication between and within the universities for sustainable benefits.

Abstract: We investigate whether and if so, how, corporate governance 'quality'(1) is related to the information flows from a company and how the share market and its agents respond. Specifically, we study links between the 'quality' of a firm's corporate governance (CGQ) and the informativeness of its disclosures. We employ six indicators of informativeness. They include document counts, properties of analysts' forecasts and a 'timeliness' metric, in the spirit of Ball and Brown (1968), that reflects the average speed of price discovery throughout the year. Our results suggest the answer to our question is 'Yes': better-governed firms do make more informative disclosures.

Abstract: While the economic benefits of the resources boom in Australia have been considerable so, too, have the impacts upon host communities. These are particularly profound in settled regions where intensive mining presents amenity problems, housing shortages, increasing demands on infrastructure, environmental degradation and conflicts with other industries such as agriculture. Attempts to manage these challenges commonly occur through a 'governance' approach involving partnership and hybrid arrangements between a whole host of stakeholders from the corporate, state and community sectors. As the closest tier of government to the local level, local government has found itself playing a central role in mining governance, particularly in responding to and managing community concerns. This paper examines the role of, and challenges facing, local government in managing the impacts of mining both alone and in collaboration with other governmental actors. It documents these issues as they relate to the resource needs, planning strategies, human capital impacts, service provision and institutional capacity of local governments in some of the most mining-intensive regions in Australia.

Abstract: In many cases, when governments commit themselves to green policy targets, they also imply the development of 'green' industries to reach those targets. But, how do governments foster the development of such industries? This is particularly relevant because such industries are often in a very early stage of their evolution. Taking the case of organic farming, we argue that the state's ability to foster 'policy capacity' is critical to the emerging development trajectories of such industries. Focussing on the state's ability to generate policy capacity in the Danish and Australian organic food sector, this article suggests that policy capacity develops as a result of high levels of state and associative capacity and the ability to create conditions favourable for corporatist deliberation. The comparative study undertaken demonstrates that these conditions are met in the Danish case, resulting in a high level of policy capacity. By contrast, Australia suffers from a low level of policy capacity as a result of low state and associative capacity and lack of corporatist deliberation.

Abstract: Transitions management (TM) is emerging as an approach to governing complex sustainability problems. Critiques point to the need to understand dynamics of system change, particularly, with regard to actor agency at micro and meso scales. This paper begins to address this scholarly gap by first, developing an analytical framework of the institutional context of a transition that recognizes forms of agency. Second, a method to apply the framework to empirical cases of urban water socio-technical systems to map their institutional context is developed. The results revealed: i) ways to identify problematic features of current systems and underlying cognitive and normative frames, to assist with envisioning and transition pathway development, ii) a method of system analysis that can target leverage points for strategizing transitions agendas and experiments, and iii) a dynamic description of the system to assist with evaluating TM interventions and monitoring transitions. By providing a systems analysis cognizant of contextual dynamics and targeted to the knowledge needs of TM activities, this analytical tool shows promise for improving TM through further empirical application and research.

Abstract: Using an online panel, we surveyed a representative sample of 500 each in Australia and New Zealand during July 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. We find trust in government has increased dramatically, with around 80% of respondents agreeing government was generally trustworthy. Around three quarters agreed management of the pandemic had increased their trust in government. Over 85% of respondents have confidence that public health scientists work in the public interest. Testing four hypotheses, we find that income and education predict trust in government and confidence in public health scientists, as does voting for the political party in government. Trust in government and confidence in public health scientists strongly predict Covid-19 phone application use, largely through convincing people the App is beneficial. Trust in government then is both an outcome and antecedent of government effectiveness. Building trust is important for governments implementing difficult policy responses during a crisis.

Abstract: Australian local government does not enjoy the status of its counterparts in comparable democracies and has long sought acknowledgment in the federal constitution. As these campaigns have consistently failed, this study considers how, and in which forms, local government obtains its own political legitimacy within a governance system centered on the citizen-state relationship, in addition to evaluating the relationships between the different forms of legitimacy. We find that positive perceptions of local government effectiveness are associated with higher levels of support for constitutional change, but that local governments need to pay more attention to systems of accountability and oversight, how building and planning issues are handled, and how they communicate with residents. Generally, and unsurprisingly, local government is appreciated more by those who rely on their services yet who are not always the loudest voices in public debates. Constitutional legitimacy is more likely when other sources of legitimacy are enhanced.

Abstract: Drawing on a systematic review of the literature, this paper explores the factors which have enabled and/or constrained the transformative potential of public service user participation within the five most influential recent narratives of public service reform. It argues that these narratives have failed either to offer a holistic conceptualisation of such participation in theory or to achieve its enactment in practice for four main reasons: participation is framed as polemic, with limited evidence of efficacy; public service delivery has been conceptualised as a linear process, with participation at its margins; structural changes have been insufficient in embedding participation; and power asymmetries have been reinforced through successive reforms. To combat these long-standing challenges, a value-creation approach is presented, which starts from an assumption of participation as a defining feature of public service delivery and considered how its import can be maximised to create value for individuals and society.

Abstract: The purpose of this article was to explore the impacts of climate change on human health in Australia in general, and the state of Queensland in particular. We evaluated healthrelated services and adaptation challenges in the health sector and indicate possible remedies. The scientific consensus on the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is convincing. Climate change will have potentially devastating human health effects including increased morbidity, mortality and injury in the near future. Its impacts will be unevenly distributed among geographical regions and population groups. The elderly, children and people who are chronically ill and economically disadvantaged will be more vulnerable than others. Adaptation is a valuable tool for minimizing the effects of climate change on human health, but the mechanisms involve various societal, cultural, economic, political, environmental, information and technological challenges that need to be addressed rigorously and cautiously. Developing and designing appropriate healthcare systems to meet the challenges involved with adaptation is equally important in reducing the health effects of climate variability. There is an increased need for information about climatic impacts on human health and a need to increase institutional capacity, social and human capital, leadership, communication and partnerships as well as promoting stakeholders' engagement in the adaptation processes in order to ensure success.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of corporate governance on the financial choices of non -financial companies operating in the Australian Securities Exchange. A purposive sampling technique was employed to select a total of 113 firms representing 14 sectors listed in the Australian Securities Exchange during the period from 2008 to 2021. The findings of the study revealed a positive and significant relationship between the size of the board, gender diversity among board members, board member affiliation, and board compensation with the financial decisions of the corporations. Additionally, the study identified that the presence of experienced and non -executive board members had a negative and significant impact on internally generated funding. Furthermore, it was observed that board gender diversity, board size, board member affiliation, and board compensation displayed a positive and significant association with debt financing, internally generated financing, and equity financing. Most organisations displayed a preference for internal and debt financing over equity funding. Aligning governance with financial decisions enhances firms' cost of capital. Governance quality affects capital market access, debt, and equity costs. Effective governance leads to favorable financing terms.

Abstract: The dominant perspective in the literature linking governance, globalization and public policy argues that globalization undercuts state capacity, weakening a government's ability to effectively regulate its domestic affairs. This paper shows otherwise with special reference to the Australian experience in financial regulation. It challenges the conventional wisdom that the Australian state is weak and cannot adopt anticipatory industrial policies. This paper argues that the adoption of the 'twin peaks' model of financial regulatory arrangements is an example of the existence of government-led steering in Australia which can adopt a proactive approach to financial regulation by steering and coordinating policy networks. 'Governance through hierarchy' in the financial services industry may be a function of the government's political entrepreneurship; its skill in setting and implementing an agenda; and an ability to create new policy communities and networks.

Using lessons learnt from past pandemics and planning exercises, public health leaders embedded an approach whereby First Nations peoples determined and led community and culturally informed pandemic control strategies and actions.In March 2020, First Nations governance was embedded into the local public health emergency response to COVID-19 in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia, enabling First Nations staff and community members to actively participate in strategic and operational decision-making with the objective of minimising COVID-19-related risks to First Nations peoples and communities. The model provided cultural insight and oversight to the local COVID-19 response; strengthened and advanced First Nations leadership; increased the First Nations public health workforce; led the development of First Nations disease surveillance strategies; and supported working groups to appropriately respond to local needs and priorities. This model demonstrates the feasibility of reframing a standard Incident Command System to embed and value First Nations principles of self-determination and empowerment to appropriately plan and respond to public health emergencies.

Abstract: Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the experience and involvement of academics in learning analytics (LA) due to its potential for improving teaching and learning. However, findings often reflect an educational culture which is indicative of the institutional or national context where the study has occurred, resulting in bias regarding LA perspectives. Therefore, this study seeks to compare and contrast the experiences of LA among academics in Australia and Malaysia, with intentions to learn from each other's experience. Areas of comparison were: (1) academics' involvement in LA activities; (2) academics' responses to the institutional capacity in supporting LA; and 3) academics' concerns about the ethical issues surrounding LA. A survey of 353 Australian and 224 Malaysian academics revealed similarities and differences. It is evident from these results that the context and infrastructure for LA are at different stages of development in both countries. Nevertheless, the results provide an interesting reflection on academics' needs, institutional understanding, policies, and educational cultural biases in applying LA in teaching and learning in higher education institutions.

Abstract: State capacity may be a crucial factor conditioning the democratizing power of elections in authoritarian regimes. This paper develops a two-phase theory considers the different effects of state capacity on turnover in elections and democratic change after elections. In regimes with limited state capacity, manipulating elections and repressing opposition is more difficult than in regimes with extensive state capacity, rendering turnover in elections more likely in weak states. However, if the new incumbent has limited capacity to deliver public services and make policy changes after coming to power, sustainable democratic change is unlikely. Hence, state capacity is hypothesized to have a negative effect on turnover, but a positive effect on democratic change. These hypotheses are confirmed in a sample of 460 elections in 110 authoritarian regimes taking place in the period 1974 to 2012 using the Varieties of Democracy dataset. The findings suggest a need to revisit strong-state-first theories of democratization.

Abstract: We inspect the impact of financial inclusion on carbon (CO2) 2 ) emissions and the role that quality of governance plays using a global dataset from 119 countries between 2004 and 2020. We address endogeneity using the dynamic two-step generalized method of moment estimator and further test the robustness of results using the Driscol-Kraay estimator, which is crucial for addressing cross-sectional and temporal dependence. The findings showed that financial inclusion and quality of governance exhibited a positive and significant impact on CO2 2 emissions. Further analysis shows that the impact of financial inclusion and governance on CO2 2 emissions varies across countries at different stages of economic development. We also documented significant variations in the results across six geographical regions. Also, the evidence from moderation and marginal effect analysis revealed that the marginal effect of financial inclusion on CO2 2 emissions is contingent on governance quality and that improving governance quality (scores) conditions financial inclusion to minimize CO2 2 emissions across the globe. We, therefore, demonstrate that in countries with relatively higher (better) governance scores, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Singapore, and New Zealand, financial inclusion significantly mitigates CO2 2 emissions compared to countries with relatively lower (weak) governance scores, such as Iraq, Zimbabwe, Ghana, and Chad. Finally, mediation analysis also highlights that the effect of financial inclusion on CO2 2 emissions is mediated by renewable energy consumption, industrialization, and household consumption. The policy implications are discussed.

Abstract: The Henry Tax Review is a work in progress, but it has already advanced sufficiently to constitute an important case study of state capacity in Australia. Using the Henry Tax Review as a case study, this paper sheds light on the question of whether the national political system is capable of devising and implementing long-term reforms. Whilst specific policy failures inevitably have a contingent dimension in the form of poor strategy and leadership or unfavourable economic conditions, the paper discusses the erosion of institutional and relational structures which, arguably, has diminished systemic political capacity. This is tantamount to a structural weakening of state capacity in Australia, a development which has the potential to erode the potential of any government to enact significant strategic policy change.

Abstract: Violent organizations are often providers of many social services in competition with the state. We provide evidence that these organizations use the provision of social services to gain support. This strategy is only effective when it fills the void left by a weak state. We show this by studying the provision of natural disaster relief by the Pakistani state and the Taliban. We first analyze the floods of 2010 that received an inadequate response from the government and show that support for the Taliban increased in the areas affected by the flood. These effects were concentrated in places where the Taliban likely provided help and where the state under-delivered. We then study the 2005 earthquake that instead received a swift government response and show that the Taliban lost support in the affected areas. Results cannot be explained by alternate mechanisms as anger against incumbents, political competition, electoral participation, and religiosity.

Abstract: Introduction Institutions play a central role in advancing the field of reproductive health in humanitarian settings (RHHS), yet little is known about organizational capacity to deliver RHHS and how this has developed over the past decade. This study aimed to document the current institutional experiences and capacities related to RHHS. Materials and Methods Descriptive study using an online questionnaire tool. Results Respondents represented 82 institutions from 48 countries, of which two-thirds originated from low-and middle-income countries. RHHS work was found not to be restricted to humanitarian agencies (25%), but was also embraced by development organizations (25%) and institutions with dual humanitarian and development mandates (50%). Agencies reported working with refugees (81%), internally-displaced (87%) and stateless persons (20%), in camp-based settings (78%), and in urban (83%) and rural settings (78%). Sixty-eight percent of represented institutions indicated having an RHHS-related policy, 79% an accountability mechanism including humanitarian work, and 90% formal partnerships with other institutions. Seventy-three percent reported routinely appointing RH focal points to ensure coordination of RHHS implementation. There was reported progress in RHHS-related disaster risk reduction (DRR), emergency management and coordination, delivery of the Minimum Initial Services Package (MISP) for RH, comprehensive RH services in post-crisis/recovery situations, gender mainstreaming, and community-based programming. Other reported institutional areas of work included capacity development, program delivery, advocacy/policy work, followed by research and donor activities. Except for abortion-related services, respondents cited improved efforts in advocacy, capacity development and technical support in their institutions for RHHS to address clinical services, including maternal and newborn health, sexual violence prevention and response, HIV prevention, management of sexually-transmitted infections, adolescent RH, and family planning. Approximately half of participants reported that their institutions had experienced an increase in dedicated budget and staff for RHHS, a fifth no change, and 1 in 10 a decrease. The Interagency RH Kits were reportedly the most commonly used supplies to support RHHS implementation. Conclusion The results suggest overall growth in institutional capacity in RHHS over the past decade, indicating that the field has matured and expanded from crisis response to include RHHS into DRR and other elements of the emergency management cycle. It is critical to consolidate the progress to date, address gaps, and sustain momentum.

Abstract: Transitioning to more sustainable urban water management is widely accepted as an essential societal objective. While there has been significant progress in developing technical solutions to the challenges faced, numerous barriers remain at the regime level, indicating that further investigation into the regime is required. This paper reports on a social research project aimed at identifying capacity attributes of a more sustainable urban water management regime. Attributes were identified for the administrative and regulatory framework, inter- and intra-organisational and individual regime spheres. Over 125 urban water practitioners specialising in sustainability in Sydney and Melbourne were interviewed to identify the attributes of a more sustainable regime. The attributes reveal that a sustainable urban water management regime emphasises learning, diverse policy tools and institutional arrangements, together with interaction among stakeholders and professional disciplines. The interaction is characterised by respect, trust and mutual understanding. The sustainable regime attributes are compared to the traditional regime and reveal that while progress has been made towards a sustainable regime, additional improvement is required. Attributes identified across multiple regime spheres indicate potential focus areas for capacity building programs or reform efforts to more effectively enable regime change towards sustainable urban water management.

Drawing on the literature that explains environmental conflicts in terms of contrasting values, a discourse analysis approach is used to identify and define the hybrid and plural values held by the groups within wind energy discourse coalitions. Importantly for future policy development, influences and views that motivate groups to participate in policy and project assessment are identified, the current battles over facts between coalitions are analysed, and the present ignorance of or preference for certain views and types of values are shown as hindering the policy making process.

Abstract: Local authorities vary considerably in their capacity for governance. The dimensions of this capacity can only be developed by drawing on local stocks of social capital. The seminal theories of social capital tend to conceive it as a community resource that is built up through a long tradition of civic engagement. We take issue with the laissez-faire implications of these theories, highlighting ways in which local governments can positively contribute to social capital formation by opening their 'political opportunity structure' and engaging voluntary organisations and community groups in trust-based partnership arrangements.

Abstract: Institutional capacity is an important element for climate change adaptation (CCA) and the development of such capacity is a great challenge in a Least Developed Country like Cambodia where resources are limited. An important first step to increasing capacity is via an understanding of the level of existing capacity; future priorities can then be subsequently identified. This study aimed to assess the capacity of organizations to implement climate change activities in Cambodia in order to provide such a basis for building capacity. Four elements of capacity were investigated in this research: (1) financial resources, (2) cooperation and coordination of stakeholders, (3) availability and quality of information on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and (4) the level of understanding of climate change vulnerability and adaptation. The data were collected through semistructured interviews with a wide range of government and non-government informants across a number of sectors. Results of the study showed that informants perceived capacity for CCA to be very constrained, especially in terms of financial resources and cooperation, and addressing these factors was ranked as the highest climate change capacity priority. Institutional capacity constraints were considered to relate more generally to weak governance of CCA. In light of our research findings, the absence of local higher education institutions in CCA activities should be addressed. The support of such institutions would provide an important mechanism to progress both capacity development as well as partnerships and coordination between different types of organizations and relevant sectors. Policy relevance Capacity for CCA within Cambodian health and water sectors was perceived to be very constrained across a range of interdependent factors. Increasing funding was ranked as the highest priority for building capacity for CCA; however, governance factors such as 'improved cooperation' were also ranked highly. Improving stakeholders' awareness of the availability of adaptation funds and resources, and their responsiveness to funding criteria, is an important implication of our research, as is improving the mobilization of local resources and the private sector. To address the issue of weak cooperation among stakeholders, improving the coordination function of the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) regarding stakeholder engagement and capacity building is crucial. Ensuring that CCA activities are based on sound information and knowledge from across different disciplines and, importantly, include the perspectives of vulnerable people themselves, ultimately underpins and supports the realization of the above priorities.

Abstract: Digitalization and the use of Smart Farming Technologies are considered a major opportunity for the future of agriculture. However, realisation of full benefits is constrained by: (1) farmers' interest in and use of big data to improve farm decision making; (2) issues of data sovereignty and trust between providers and users of data and technology; (3) institutional arrangements associated with the governance of data platforms. This paper examines the case of Australia's dairy herd milk recording system, arguably one of agriculture's first cases of 'big data' use, which collects, analyses and uses farm-level data (milk production, lactation and breeding records) to provide individual cow and herd performance information, used by individual farmers for farm management decisions. The aim of this study was to 1) examine the use of big data to add value to farm decision making; and 2) explore factors and processes, including institutional arrangements, which influence farmer engagement with and use of big data. This paper traces the Australian history of the organisation of dairy herd recording (established in 1912 and digitalized in late 1970s) and then uses findings from a longitudinal study of 7 case study dairy farms, which were incentivised to become involved in herd recording in 2015. Applying a conceptual framework linking path dependency in farm decision making and collaborative governance capacity, we find three new important dimensions of the farm user context influencing farmer demand for big data applications: 1) the transition to a new business stage; 2) the additionality farmers seek from data generated in one component of the farm system to other subsystems, and 3) the use of data in long term or strategic decision making. Further, we identified critical attributes of support services in addressing digital literacy, capacity and capability issues at farm level, including diversity in data presentation formats and facilitation of the on-farm transition process through intermediary herd test organisations. The role of farmers as governance actors, or citizens in the decisions of the trajectory of big data applications, adds to understanding of the nature of collaborative governance arrangements that support farm engagement.

Abstract: Managing large river basins for sustainability is a contentious social-ecological arena challenging traditional scientific and rational planning approaches to water and related natural resources governance. "Crises" are inevitable but double-edged: creating threats and uncertainties, but also new opportunities to shape trajectories of change and avoid adverse consequences. A case study of the large remote cross-border Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), in arid central Australia, shows how over two decades a series of social-ecological and political-administrative "crises" emerged, posing significant environmental and social dilemmas for water governance, while also opening up opportunities for institutional change. This article examines the role of crises in the emergence and evolution of water governance in the LEB, how they were perceived, the challenges and opportunities posed, social and institutional responses, and governance capacity outcomes. Finally, it reflects on emergent crises as opportunities for more systemic and adaptive change in large river basins.

Abstract: In the context of calls for a 'third way' which proposes the abandonment of many of the social democratic and statist commitments of the postwar era, this paper reviews both the responsibilities accepted by peak bodies such as ACOSS and those that ought to be retained by government. It is sceptical of claims that social policy debates in Australia lead to the conclusion that welfare state development here has been satisfactory. Social democratic objectives (derived from intellectual contributions in the 1940s and 1950s as well as from the comparative political economy of the 1980s and 1990s) emphasize more decommodified provision of services than can be readily admitted in Australia. If the demand for social welfare and social policy continues to increase to the extent suggested by past and present circumstances, serious implications emerge for both public and private providers.

By using a large sample of 1207 firms from 2001 to 2013, we find a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have greatly improved stock liquidity. Specifically, we find that better governed firms have a lower trading cost, smaller price impacts of trade, and higher trading speed. Moreover, the empirical results reveal that CGQ improves stock liquidity because it is associated with higher information disclosure.

Abstract: A remarkable process of reform of intergovernmental arrangements was initiated in Australia in 1990 designed, according to its proponents, 'to improve our national efficiency and international competitiveness and to improve the delivery and quality of services governments provide.' Unlike previous 'new federalisms' in Australia (and elsewhere) the reform process on this occasion was neither totally unilateral, nor top-down in design and implementation. Rather, while reflecting the commonwealth (federal) government's frustrations at the limits imposed by the federal system on its political power and administrative capacity, the process intentionally was cooperative, incorporating all state and territory government leaders, and including representatives of local government. In the context of a review of the origins, nature and objectives of the reform initiative, this article points both to the valuable innovations embodied in its processes, and to the of reduced political access and citizen participation created by its attempts to apply 'single-government' managerialist principles to the redesign of intergovernmental arrangements in federal systems. Political and bureaucratic objectives, combined with a lack of adequate appreciation of federal principles, led, in our view, to an attempt to supplant participatory politics with relatively less accessible and responsive managerial structures.

Abstract: Food security is an issue, not only in developing countries but also in developed economies such as Australia where people from vulnerable groups cannot access affordable and appropriate food on a daily basis. Agencies emphasise the need for collaborative approaches to such complex, multi-sectoral challenges. This article analyses two inter-governmental partnership approaches facilitating local government's response to food insecurity in 12 municipalities within the state of Victoria. We focus on the partnership approaches to collaboration, processes and structures, and collective outcomes. The comparative data analysis from in-depth interviews and document analysis of project-associated materials and municipal policies provides insight into the different partnership approaches. Results suggest that while strategically designed and focused inter-governmental partnerships can build local government capacity to respond to food security, there are systemic, regulatory, and resource barriers in play. In conclusion, the implications of these findings for future inter-governmental approaches to address complex challenges are considered. Intergovernmental partnerships are increasingly used to address complex multi-sectoral challenges like food security, which is a problem even in developed economies such as Australia. This article identifies a need to mitigate systemic, regulatory and resource barriers that limit two state-local government partnership approaches to enhance food security within twelve municipalities.

Abstract: Political scientists have recently debated the extent to which strong state capacity helps authoritarian regimes to win elections and extend their rule. This article proposes that it is not only important to disaggregate the various forms of state capacity mobilized for that purpose, but also to analyze the sequence with which autocracies deploy them. Using Suharto's New Order regime in Indonesia as a case study, I argue that regimes mobilize different forms of state capacity in distinct phases of their development, and that the sequencing of this deployment can have implications for the regime's endurance. Suharto, for example, gradually reduced the importance of coercion as he increasingly focused on the state's ability to facilitate elite co-optation and economic patronage. This helped to extend the regime's endurance as long as the economy flourished, but also made it vulnerable to the fluctuations in the world economy that caused its demise in 1998.

Abstract: This paper explores the association between director turnover and increased audit fees in Australia. The study, aligned with upper echelon theory, reveals that the characteristics and actions of top management, as reflected in director turnover, impact corporate decisions and risktaking behavior. Specifically, higher director turnover is linked to elevated audit fees, disrupting the stability of top management's monitoring and advisory functions. The association is more pronounced for external turnover compared to internal turnover. Additionally, firms with robust corporate governance quality exhibit a weakened positive relationship between director turnover and audit fees. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic further amplifies the director turnover/audit fees connection. The findings suggest that auditors are likely to consider and price in the impact of board instability on internal controls and monitoring/advisory functions.

Abstract: Municipal planning represents a key avenue for local adaptation, but is subject to recognised constraints. To date, these constraints have focused on simplistic factors such as limited resources and lack of information. In this paper we argue that this focus has obscured a wider set of constraints which need to be acknowledged and addressed if adaptation is likely to advance through municipal planning. Although these recognised constraints are relevant, we argue that what underpins these issues are more fundamental challenges affecting local, placed-based planning by drawing on the related field of community-based environmental planning (CBEP). In considering a wider set of constraints to practical attempts towards adaptation, the paper considers planning based on a case study of three municipalities in Sydney, Australia in 2008. The results demonstrate that climate adaptation was widely accepted as an important issue for planning conducted by local governments. However, it was yet to be embedded in planning practice which retained a strong mitigation bias in relation to climate change. In considering the case study, we draw attention to factors thus far under-acknowledged in the climate adaptation literature. These include leadership, institutional context and competing planning agendas. These factors can serve as constraints or enabling mechanisms for achieving climate adaptation depending upon how they are exploited in any given situation. The paper concludes that, through addressing these issues, local, place-based planning can play a greater role in achieving climate adaptation.

After checking that the index is positively associated with standard indicators of firm performance, we use it to evaluate the returns oil governance-sorted portfolios. Our main finding is that poorly governed firms significantly outperform better-governed firms. However, this result derives from the greater risk exposure of poorly governed firms. After adjusting for size and book-to-market, excess returns become insignificant across all portfolios. We verify that neither the sample period nor the behavior of specific industries is responsible for this outcome.

Abstract: Global challenges face many local governments, which in turn, need to rapidly build their capacity to respond. Local government requires alignment with organizational partners, higher levels of government, external societal actors and local constituents, through the concept of institutional fit, to acquire the capacity to respond to global challenges. Institutional fit discursively enables local government to increase its reach and collective capacity. We analysed institutional fit in two local government case studies in Australia that aimed to improve food security through addressing equity and other social aspects to the challenge. Case study analysis was based on in-depth interviews, primary document analysis and secondary data analysis pertaining to the food security initiatives. Findings show that collaborative partnerships can provide greater understanding of the goals, roles and higher-level commitment needed for institutional fit. Aligning capacities and roles between and within organizations and institutions is also required because local government is severely restricted without whole-of-institutional commitment to similar goals. We found, however, that local government is constrained in its response to change because of the complex nature of the challenge and because neoliberalism militates against fit within the wider domain of the entire institutional response. We argue that institutional fit needs to be embedded within any change process. More nuanced and targeted understandings of the roles of each organization can then be understood, along with the role of power within the institutional domain, so that appropriate planning occurs to identify and target which responses are achieved and by whom.

Moreover, empirical evidence supports the role of stock liquidity as a channel of the relationship. Overall these findings have practical implications for the stakeholders in Australia.

Abstract: Community-based forest management systems (CBFMS) are becoming increasingly popular in developing countries where 31% of the total forest is either managed or owned by the community. This paper presents the results of a four-country study conducted in 2017 in Nepal, Bhutan, India and Myanmar concerning the governance quality of CBFMS. The introduction outlines the global threat to forests, the contribution that forest based emissions make to climate change, and the policy response of the international and national communities including REDD +. The next section provides a snapshot of CBFMS in the four case study countries, and is followed by an account of the methodology, approach, framework of analysis and sampling surveys undertaken during the course of, and informing, the research. The results of the surveys revealed that perceptions of governance quality, as well as governance priorities, varied between the countries, and also at the three levels of government (national, sub-national and local) within a country. For example, Myanmar and Bhutan had very high governance ratings from local levels compared to other levels, whereas, Nepal and India had similar ratings for all levels. Further, regarding the prioritisation of different indicators, Myanmar gave highest priority to "inclusiveness" at the local level but "democracy" at the national level. The reasons for the similarities and differences between and within these countries and the possible implications are discussed.

Abstract: IntroductionThe delivery of services to improve Aboriginal health and well-being must centre culture and integrate a social and emotional well-being understanding and approaches. These approaches are essential in increasing access to, and engagement with, health services, as well as ensuring culturally safe, person-centred and community-centred care. This study will evaluate the Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia's social and emotional well-being model of service being piloted in five Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services across five of Western Australia's regions. The model of service includes the establishment of interdisciplinary social and emotional well-being teams and a four-pillar approach to service delivery.Methods and analysisAn Aboriginal Participatory Action Research methodology will be undertaken which calls for Indigenous leadership and governance, capacity-building of community co-researchers and engagement in reflexive practice. The evaluation will take a mixed-methods approach to data collection, including at each pilot site, yarns with up to five clients engaging with social and emotional well-being services; qualitative interviews with up to five service providers at each site, and up to five key knowledge holders from stakeholders including funders and commissioning bodies; the collection of clinical data; facilitated discussion using the social and emotional well-being Systems Assessment Tool; and document analysis and cost-estimation. Analysis will be guided by a client journey mapping framework, and data will be collectively analysed through a socioecological framework to understand the connections and inter-relatedness between client outcomes and experiences, social and emotional well-being team and service provider experiences, service systems and governance structures.Ethics and disseminationThis evaluation was approved by the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (HREC1204). The findings will be disseminated through the production of an evaluation report and academic publications and presentations. Findings will also be disseminated through community forums and plain language summaries. These outputs will detail evaluation findings and recommendations, the process of evaluation through an Aboriginal Participatory Action Research approach and the collaborative stakeholder relationship-building that underpinned the project.

Abstract: Post-disaster reconstruction relies on, and is shaped by, the good intentions of states, non-governmental organizations, and donors. These intentions, however, are inescapably framed by historical circumstances and cultural values. Consequently, post-disaster interventions can reinforce patterns of prejudice, injustice, and disadvantage that were entrenched in pre-disaster settings. Focusing on the experiences of Indigenous Rukai communities in southern Taiwan during recovery and reconstruction following Typhoon Morakot in 2009, this article explores the challenges faced in addressing Indigenous-specific concerns in post-disaster reconstruction and community development. We argue that institutional capacity (and capacity deficits) and the procedural vulnerability created in post-disaster responses are components of the risk landscape which require greater attention to diverse cultural values, protocols, and experiences in fostering resilient and inclusive disaster recovery approaches. In Taiwan, the particular complexities of Indigenous geographies, colonial and postcolonial circumstances, and contemporary political dynamics make developing approaches that are respectful of Indigenous cultural values, social aspirations, and political processes not only more difficult but also more important in shaping post-disaster community at multiple scales. Attentiveness to these values, aspirations, and processes generates opportunities for decreasing vulnerability to the extraordinary and the everyday disasters that communities confront.

Abstract: Majority of the literature suggest that the determination of natural resources as either a curse or a blessing cannot be solely based on their impact on economic and social development. This study investigates the relationship between sustainable human development, governance quality, green energy innovation, and CO2 emissions in oil and gas sector of China. The data from 2002 to 2022 was taken for the analysis. This study employed the novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (D-ARDL) method to examine long-term and short-term relationships. Our results of short-term analysis demonstrated that all the variables - institutional governance, sustainable human development renewable energy innovation, government stability and renewable energy consumption-have an influential role in reduce carbon emissions. The results of long run analysis reiterate findings of short run, highlighting the inverse relationship of the variables with carbon emissions. The t-statistic shows of such relationships are statistically significant in the long run. The findings of the study offer valuable insights and empirical evidence to reduce emissions using governance quality, sustainable human development, green energy innovation and renewable energy consumption in oil and gas sector of China. Our findings demonstrate that implementation of these strategies require long-term commitment and concerted efforts.

Abstract: The UNFCCC requires REDD+ countries wishing to receive results-based payments to measure, report and verify (MRV) REDD+ impacts; and outlines technical guidelines and good governance requirements for MRV. This article examines institutional effectiveness of REDD+ MRV by assessing countries' progress in implementing these technical guidelines and good governance requirements, from three dimensions. Ownership of technical methods examines whether countries own technical methods for forest area and area change measuring, and for estimating forest carbon stocks; and whether national MRV systems cover all forests, land uses and carbon pools. Administrative capacity examines development of administrative competence to implement MRV. Good governance examines whether countries espouses norms of good governance in their MRV systems. We apply these dimensions to assess and compare progress in 13 REDD+ countries, based on a review of national and international documents. Findings show that REDD+ countries have high to very high ownership of technical methods. However, majority ranks only low to moderate on administrative capacity and good governance. This means that although countries have started developing technical methods for MRV, they are yet to develop the competence necessary to administer MRV and to inculcate good governance in MRV. The article explain the scores and suggest ways of improving implementation of REDD+ MRV. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Liberal democratic states like Australia manage criminal justice issues in ways which reflect an inbuilt tension between liberal and democratic values. Liberal democracies are responsive both to liberal claims and to democratic claims. As a result, policy debates and strategies can oscillate between (on the one hand) liberal sensitivity to individual rights and opposition to enhanced state capacity and (on the other hand) democratically legitimised community norms and collective values. Four dime-related policy debates - about the creation and operation of the National Crime Authority, about strategies for combating drug-related crime, about gun control legislation and about identity systems to counter money laundering, tax evasion and public benefit fraud - illustrate the characteristic liberal democratic mode of politics in operation. The spectrum of policy responses to crime issues within liberal democratic political systems corresponds to an. analogous spectrum within criminology which encompasses individualistic and structuralist conceptions of the nature and causes of crime.

Abstract: Recent work on industry policy argues that group and state capacity are important in underpinning (or undermining) the capacity to govern industrial development. Put simply, group capacity-alongside state capacity-is deemed an important ingredient in any recipe for (re)developing national industry. This article further develops the literature on governance and transformative capacity, adding deliberative networking as a key facet. Examining the development of the organic farming sector in Australia, it is argued that the absence of transformative capacity frustrates development. Specifically, although the state has slowly come to see a need for some interaction and facilitation of organic industry development, particularly of a national domestic standard, this intervention is made difficult by the absence of: (i) capable organic industry organisations; (ii) 'in-house' departmental expertise; and (iii) venues capable of fostering policy deliberation. We argue that the reworked concept of transformative capacity can have wider application in making sense of industry development in other infant industries.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss is one of the most significant drivers of ecosystem change and is projected to continue at a rapid rate. While protected areas, such as national parks, are seen as important refuges for biodiversity, their effectiveness in stemming biodiversity decline has been questioned. Public agencies have a critical role in the governance of many such areas, but there are tensions between the need for these agencies to be more "adaptive" and their current operating environment. Our aim is to analyze how institutions enable or constrain capacity to conserve biodiversity in a globally significant cross-border network of protected areas, the Australian Alps. Using a novel conceptual framework for diagnosing biodiversity institutions, our research examined institutional adaptive capacity and more general capacity for conserving biodiversity. Several intertwined issues limit public agencies' capacity to fulfill their conservation responsibilities. Narrowly defined accountability measures constrain adaptive capacity and divert attention away from addressing key biodiversity outcomes. Implications for learning were also evident, with protected area agencies demonstrating successful learning for on-ground issues but less success in applying this learning to deeper policy change. Poor capacity to buffer political and community influences in managing significant cross-border drivers of biodiversity decline signals poor fit with the institutional context and has implications for functional fit. While cooperative federalism provides potential benefits for buffering through diversity, it also means protected area agencies have restricted authority to address cross-border threats. Restrictions on staff authority and discretion, as public servants, have further implications for deploying capacity. This analysis, particularly the possibility of fostering "ambidexterity"-creatively responding to political pressures in a way that also achieves a desirable outcome for biodiversity conservation-is one promising way of building capacity to buffer both political influences and ecological pressures. The findings and the supporting analysis provide insight into how institutional capacity to conserve biodiversity can be enhanced in protected areas in Australia and elsewhere, especially those governed by public agencies and/or multiple organizations and across jurisdictions.

Abstract: Research shows that state capacity is crucial for economic development, yet the impact of inequality on state capacity is not well understood. This paper examines the impact of income inequality on three key dimensions of state capacity, namely legal, fiscal and collective capacity using annual data for a core of 21 OECD countries over the period 1870-2013. We find that the marked reduction in inequality over most of the last century starting from 1916 was pivotal to the significant improvements in legal, fiscal and collective capacity in the OECD countries over the same period.

Abstract: Purpose - Institutional governance theory is used to explain voluntary corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting in the context of a market governance system in the absence of climate change public policy. This paper seeks to hypothesise that GHG reporting is related to internal organisation systems, external privately promulgated guidance and EU ETS trading. Design/methodology/approach - A two-stage approach is used. The initial model examines whether firms' GHG disclosures are associated with internal organisation systems factors: environmental management systems (EMS), corporate governance quality and environmental management committees as well as external private guidance provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 187 ASX 300 firms. EU ETS trading is also included. Determinants of the extent and credibility of GHG disclosure is examined in the second stage where an index constructed from the GHG reporting standard "ISO 14064-1" items for a sub-sample of 80 disclosing firms as the dependent variable. Findings - Firms that voluntarily disclose GHGs have EMSs (uncertified and certified), higher corporate governance quality and publicly report to the CDP, tend to be large and in the energy and mining and industrial sectors. The credibility and extent of disclosures are related to the existence of a certified EMS, public reporting to the CDP, and use of the GRI. Firms that disclose more credible information are more likely to be large and in the energy and mining, industrial and services sectors. Originality/value - The paper shows that some proactive but pragmatic Australian firms are disclosing their GHGs voluntarily for competitive advantage in the current market governance system in the absence of public policy.

Abstract: We report on the establishment of communities of practice at four Australian institutions and evaluate their effectiveness and durability as a means of building staff and institutional capacity for interdisciplinary teaching. A community of practice approach is a potentially valuable methodology for overcoming dynamics of fragmentation, isolation and competition within universities. The communities we established were anchored by a shared focus on the topic of climate change and they worked collaboratively to build relationships of trust and reciprocity between teachers in a wide range of disciplines. The aim of each community was to improve the teaching of climate change through enabling members to integrate diverse disciplinary perspectives, to teach collaboratively, to promote innovation through exchange and to demonstrate leadership within their institutions. The key factors that made our communities effective and durable are: (1) designation of two leadership roles, activator and facilitator, (2) provision for institutional autonomy in domesticating the model to fit local circumstances and (3) a pragmatic emphasis on opportunities for teaching innovation and leadership within existing administrative structures, teaching programs and workloads. We conclude that suitably designed and resourced communities of practice are a viable means of improving interdisciplinary teaching of complex problems by facilitating both staff development and institutional learning.

Abstract: The river basin organisation (RBO) model has been advocated as organisational best practice for sustainable river basin management, despite scant evidence of its effectiveness to manage complex river systems. This review provides a framework which combines functional social-institutional capacities with basin biophysical indicators in a diagnostic tool to determine RBO governance performance. Each of these two capacities are represented by four groups of indicators respectively covering social learning capacity and biophysical capacity. The distance and alignment between capacity and measure of performance scores can be used to prioritise program planning and resource allocation for improving river basin governance, and to undertake periodic evaluations as part of a trajectory analysis. The diagnostic functional framework provides tangible indicators of performance around key concepts in river basin governance. It offers a first attempt to strengthen the position and effectiveness of an RBO in dealing with complex adaptive systems.

Abstract: Coral reef restoration is gaining considerable momentum globally in response to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs. In Australia, as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP), a range of unconventional interventions are currently being investigated to help the Great Barrier Reef resist, repair and recover from climate change. Many of these interventions are based on innovative approaches, such as assisted evolution. The regulatory environment is likely to be critical in determining the feasibility and viability of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It influences what, where and how to restore, who should be responsible for, engaged in, and benefit from restoration. This study explores the regulatory implications of proposed restoration and adaptation interventions in the context of the Great Barrier Reef. This includes mapping the existing regulatory and governance landscape, establishing an approach to account for regulatory requirements of restoration and adaptation interventions, and examining regulatory issues associated with their development and deployment. The study also scopes administrative capacity; i.e., the capacity of regulators in terms of resources and skills required to assess novel risks and impacts of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It provides important insights that may prove useful for other jurisdictions, where ecosystem restoration and adaptation has become an imperative under a fast-changing climate.

Abstract: The Government of Indonesia (GoI) increasingly relies on the private sector financing to build and operate infrastructures through public private partnership (PPP) schemes. However, PPP does not automatically provide the solution for the financing scheme due to value for money (VFM) issues. The procurement authority must show whether a PPP proposal is the optimal solution that provides best VFM outcome. The paper presents a literature review of comparing quantitative VFM methodology for PPP infrastructure project procurement in Indonesia and Australia. Public Sector Comparator (PSC) is used to assess the potential project VFM quantitatively in Australia. In Indonesia, the PSC has not been applied, where the PPP procurement authority tends to utilize a common project evaluation method that ignores the issues of risk. Unlike the conventional price bid evaluation, the PSC enables a financial comparison including costs/gains and risks. Since the construction of PSC is primarily on risk management approach, it can facilitate risk negotiation processes between the involved parties. The study indicates that the quantitative VFM methodology of PSC is potentially applicable in Indonesia for water supply sector. Various supporting regulations are available that emphasize the importance of VFM and risk management in infrastructure investment. However, the study also reveals a number of challenges that need to be anticipated, such as the need of a more comprehensive PPP policy at both central and local government level, a more specific legal instrument for bidding evaluation method and the issue of institutional capacity development in PPP Units at the local level.

Abstract: The more a government is effective and fair, the more legitimacy that government is likely to attain, and the more it will possess the potential to elicit compliance without excessive monitoring or punitive action. We explore this proposition using contemporary survey data from sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, we are interested in the conditions that promote popular legitimating beliefs that provide support for governments that are attempting to serve their entire populations competently and in a manner that is relatively impartial and equitable. This article provides empirical support for a long hypothesized link between the extent of government effectiveness, procedural justice, and citizens' willingness to defer to governmental tax authority. The sample, drawn from a continuum of developing societies in Africa, allows us to analyze the impact of variations in government effectiveness and citizen perceptions of fairness on the sense of obligation to comply with the tax authorities, our indicator for legitimating beliefs.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the impact of national governance quality on clean energy supplies in developing countries. We used a large sample of 103 developing countries over 21 years. We employ pooled ordinary least squares as the primary estimator. Additionally, we apply a Fixed Effect and the Two-Step System-Generalized Method of Moments to mitigate contemporaneity bias. Following prior studies, we construct national governance quality from the six World Governance Indicators. Consistent with our expectations, we find a positive and significant association between national governance quality and clean energy supplies. The results show that countries with high national governance quality are more likely to generate high amounts of clean energy than low-governed countries and to experience a high green economy. The results are also significant when the governance indicator is disaggregated into individual components. However, in a continental analysis, we found that the link between national governance quality and clean energy supplies is stronger in Africa than on other continents. Our results are robust to alternative measurements and econometric identification strategies.

Abstract: Objectives Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) provide subsidised access to health services for the poor. Proxy means tests (PMTs) for income are typically employed to identify eligible beneficiaries for subsidised services but often result in significant mistargeting of benefits. We assessed the PMT approach used in Myanmar's hospital equity fund (HEF). Methods We analysed inclusion/exclusion errors by comparing household eligibility under the PMT used for HEF with household consumption (the gold standard proxy for income in LMICs). We assessed receipt of benefits post-hospitalisation against HEF eligibility rules and household income. Focus groups/interviews were conducted to understand administrative factors that influence targeting. We modelled (linear regression) predictors of household consumption to improve PMT accuracy. Results We found large targeting errors (86% of households in the bottom consumption quartile would be excluded and 15% of households in the top consumption quartile deemed eligible). HEF scores for PMT held little explanatory power for household income: 93% of individuals meeting the HEF eligibility criteria did not receive benefits post-hospitalisation, while 23% of ineligible individuals received programme support. Re-weighting PMT indicators on electricity access, land ownership and livestock ownership, and assigning weights to home-ownership, households with elderly/disabled members and household head education levels could significantly improve targeting accuracy. Poor programme awareness and uneven adherence to official eligibility determination procedures among staff likely affected targeting. Conclusions Re-weighting PMT indicators and increasing training and communication about qualification procedures could improve allocation of limited funds, though accurate targeting may continue to be challenging in contexts of low state capacity.

Abstract: Indigenous peoples within the Murray-Darling Basin have traditionally struggled for the recognition of their cultural, social, environmental, spiritual, commercial and economic connection to the waters that they have traditionally used, as well as their right to engage in all stages of water planning processes. Despite Australian national and federal frameworks providing for the inclusion of Indigenous Australians' objectives in planning frameworks, water plans have rarely addressed these objectives in water, or the strategies to achieve them. Indeed, insufficient resources, a lack of institutional capacity in both Indigenous communities and agencies and an inadequate understanding of Indigenous people's objectives in water management have limited the extent to which Indigenous objectives are addressed in water plans within the Murray-Darling Basin. In this context, the adoption of specific guidelines to meet Indigenous requirements in relation to basin water resources is crucial to support Indigenous engagement in water planning processes. Using insights from participatory planning methods and human rights frameworks, this article outlines a set of alternative and collaborative guidelines to improve Indigenous involvement in water planning and to promote sustainable and just water allocations.

Abstract: Considerable effort in recent years has gone into rebuilding fragile states. However, the debates over the effectiveness of such state-building exercises have tended to neglect that capacity building and the associated good governance programmes which comprise contemporary state building are essentially about transforming the state - meaning the ways in which political power is produced and reproduced. State capacity is now often presented as the missing link required for generating positive development outcomes and security. However, rather than being an objective and technical measure, capacity building constitutes a political and ideological mechanism for operationalising projects of state transnationalisation. The need to question prevailing notions of state capacity has become apparent in light of the failure of many state-building programmes. Such programmes have proven difficult to implement, and implementation has rarely achieved the expected development turnarounds or alleviation of violent conflict in those countries. In this article it is argued that, to identify the potential trajectories Of Such interventions, we must understand the role state building currently plays in domestic politics, and in particular, the ways in which processes of state transformation affect the development of different and often conflicting power bases within the state. This argument is examined using examples from the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands.

Abstract: Rapid decentralisation in Indonesia has shifted responsibility for managing substantial public funding from national to district governments and increased the importance of local government at the district level in delivering public services. Local government budget delays have become a huge problem as they not only delay the local government's delivery of services but also reduce its functional capacity. Our research assesses problems of budget delay in Indonesian districts. Three districts were chosen as case studies for interviews and group discussions. The research finds that human capacity and administrative problems have slowed the development and enactment of budgets. Moreover, efforts to keep election promises, especially to develop infrastructure, have not only brought a lengthy process of bargaining for economic and financial resources but also undermined the participatory budget process. This has been intensified by poor political interaction, as shown in the three case studies.

Abstract: To build capacity for addressing complex sustainable development challenges, governments, development agencies, and non-governmental organizations are making substantial investments in governance networks. Yet, enthusiasm for establishing governance networks is not always matched by empirical evidence on their effectiveness. This gap challenges these groups to know whether investing in governance networks is worth their time and effort; a weighing-up that is particularly critical in contexts of limited resources. Through a qualitative case study in Solomon Islands, we evaluate the extent to which a governance network, called the Malaita Provincial Partners for Development, contributed to four dimensions of collaborative governance capacity: individual, relational, organizational, and institutional. We find that the network made moderate contributions to individual, relational and organizational capacity, while institutional capacity remained low despite the presence of the network. Based on these findings, we argue that governance networks are not a panacea. Continued efforts are needed to establish when, how, and in what contexts collaborative networks are effective for building collaborative capacity for sustainable development.

Abstract: European Cohesion Policy is a complex scheme that allocates financial resources to European regions. The implementation of the policy is based on an articulated multi-level governance that involves local and national authorities and the European Commission. Local authorities often face difficulties in using structural funds due to limits in their administrative capacity (supply) and/or inefficiencies in adequately stimulating applications' submission (demand). By modelling and simulating the implementation of the policy, we explore how operations and decisions at the local authorities' and potential applicants' level (micro-foundations) explain emerging patterns of funds' absorption at a regional level (macro-behaviours). Building upon a mixed-methods approach combining field research and computer simulation, we develop a model capturing the key cause-effect relationships among agents and resources within the Cohesion Policy supply-and-demand system.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to use insurance stock returns as an indicator of insurance activities, and apply a dynamic panel technique to examine the link between the role of insurance and economic growth. Our empirical results show that after we control for the variations of market index returns, there is a significantly positive relationship between insurance stock returns and future economic growth. Furthermore, we also investigate how law environment and governance quality affect the link between the role of insurance and economic growth. The empirical results are consistent with our expectation that a well-defined law environment and governance quality facilitate the functioning of insurance companies, and strengthen the role of insurance in economic growth. We find generally that the effect of law and governance on the link between the role of insurance and economic growth is more significant in developed markets than in emerging markets.

Abstract: In their Institutions for the Earth (1993), Haas, Keohane and Levy argue that, at the international level, three fundamental conditions must be met for the effective management of environmental problems. They summarise these conditions as the three 'Cs'-the building of concern; the existence of a suitable contractual environment; and the growth of state capacity. We applied the Haas, Keohane and Levy (HKL) model to three case studies at the national level, in order to ascertain the extent to which the three Cs explained the emergence of successful institutional regimes. We found that two of the three variables-improvements to the contractual environment and increases in state capacity-had considerable explanatory power. Concern was important in providing the motive force for change, but high levels of concern did not lead to effective institutional regimes unless the other two factors were present. We found a strong reciprocal relationship between state capacity and the contractual environment-the ability to monitor solutions and to generate policy-relevant 'trustable' information, was positively associated with improved negotiating structures and outcomes.

Abstract: This study examines the quest for environmental sustainability in Africa by analyzing the roles of natural resource abundance, governance quality, and government expenditure. It explores the relationships between these variables, employing the N-shaped hypothesis across 42 African countries from 1986 to 2020 grouped into resource-rich and resource-poor countries. Utilizing the Lewbel 2SLS modeling technique, the research evaluates how these factors interact and impact carbon and nitrous emissions in the region. The findings reveal distinct patterns: resource-poor countries exhibit an N-shaped relationship between natural resource abundance and emissions. In contrast, resource-rich countries show such patterns between government expenditure and carbon emissions. Moreover, in resource-rich countries, higher natural resource abundance, government expenditure, and governance effectiveness tend to increase carbon emissions but decrease nitrous emissions. Conversely, in resource-poor economies, carbon emissions decrease with natural resource abundance and governance quality but increase with government expenditure and effectiveness. Additionally, regulatory quality positively correlates with nitrous emissions across all contexts. The study's insights offer valuable guidance for policymakers aiming to foster environmental sustainability, emphasizing tailored strategies based on the diverse impacts of natural resources, governance, and government spending across different economic contexts.

Abstract: This article documents terrain ruggedness as an underlying cause of lack of state capacity. The paper contends that rugged topography poses significant costs to cooperation among the constituent groups within the state. This problem then translates into inability to commit to policies and under-provision of public goods, leading to such outcomes as poor protection of rule of law, limited tax revenue, civil violence, and ultimately, a weak state apparatus. Using several indicators capturing different dimensions of state capacity, the paper econometrically tests its argument in a sample of 187 independent countries and finds robust and clear evidence in favor of its reasoning. Further, the paper documents that delayed urbanization constitutes an important transmission mechanism for the significant role of terrain ruggedness in reduced state capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Mainstreaming climate change adaptation (CCA) into plans and programs is still a new approach in adaptation and thus there is limited information on how to operationalize it on-ground. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into the local land use plans in the province of Albay, Philippines. Specifically, this paper developed 20 quantitative "mainstreaming indicators" to assess the state-of-play and the challenges for local mainstreaming. These indicators were classified under three groupings, namely, the information, institutional, and resource capacities of systems. Qualitative analysis of the indicator scores suggested that developing the institutional capacities of local governments is crucial in the local mainstreaming process. Likewise, the results highlighted the "institutional issues" indicator as the primary barrier in operationalizing the approach. These institutional issues are: fragmented laws and regulations; overlapping policy requirements; and the lack of guidelines for mainstreaming CCA into the local land use plans. Meanwhile, the "leadership" indicator, as signified by a climate change champion in Albay, was evaluated as an opportunity for local mainstreaming. The champion effectively led the CCA efforts because the existing institutional mechanisms supported the champion's capacity to influence the behavior of people and produce collective action towards CCA.

Abstract: In urban and suburban areas, stormwater runoff is a primary stressor on surface waters. Conventional urban stormwater drainage systems often route runoff directly to streams and rivers, thus exacerbating pollutant inputs and hydrologic disturbance, and resulting in the degradation of ecosystem structure and function. Decentralized stormwater management tools, such as low impact development (LID) or water sensitive urban design (WSUD), may offer a more sustainable solution to stormwater management if implemented at a watershed scale. These tools are designed to pond, infiltrate, and harvest water at the source, encouraging evaporation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and re-use of stormwater. While there are numerous demonstrations of WSUD practices, there are few examples of widespread implementation at a watershed scale with the explicit objective of protecting or restoring a receiving stream. This article identifies seven major impediments to sustainable urban stormwater management: (1) uncertainties in performance and cost, (2) insufficient engineering standards and guidelines, (3) fragmented responsibilities, (4) lack of institutional capacity, (5) lack of legislative mandate, (6) lack of funding and effective market incentives, and (7) resistance to change. By comparing experiences from Australia and the United States, two developed countries with existing conventional stormwater infrastructure and escalating stream ecosystem degradation, we highlight challenges facing sustainable urban stormwater management and offer several examples of successful, regional WSUD implementation. We conclude by identifying solutions to each of the seven impediments that, when employed separately or in combination, should encourage widespread implementation of WSUD with watershed-based goals to protect human health and safety, and stream ecosystems.

Abstract: In view of past environmental degradation and anticipated climate change impacts, we assessed the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. In a workshop with staff from three Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) who had jurisdiction over three sub-basins, as well as technical experts, nine adaptation options were identified that ranged from environmental flows, restoring river channel habitat, reoperating infrastructure and controlling invasive species. A Catchment Adaptation Framework was developed and used to assess and compare these adaptation options with each of the CMAs, drawing on interviews with their key stakeholders, to identify the risks, benefits and costs. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation can augment catchment management programs and requires investment in a suite of different but complementary measures to lower risk. Our research found institutional challenges in implementing this approach, including the complexities of multi-agency management, constricting legal requirements, narrow funding arrangements, under-developed institutional capacity, difficulties of implementing catchment-scale programs on private property and the need to adhere to community expectations. These institutional issues are ubiquitous internationally and point to the wider issues of providing sufficient management capacity to support adaptation. The Catchment Adaptation Framework presented here enables river basin managers to systematically assess the adaptation options to better inform their decision-making.

Abstract: This paper argues that neoliberalism should be viewed not as a unified coherent project but as a series of complex and overlapping strategies that produce hybrid and always emergent forms of governance. To substantiate this argument, the paper reflects on the recent history of Sydney's metropolitan planning and rejects any simple characterisation of its having been transformed from a social-democratic to a neoliberal form of governance. Instead it traces the unevenness with which neoliberalist aspirations and forms of governance have been enacted through metropolitan planning. In particular, it examines the enduring scope of state institutional capacity to pursue desired spatial and distributional outcomes through planning and suggests that the current reinvigoration of Sydney's metropolitan planning is an opportunity to enhance that capacity and to pursue 'after-neoliberalist' planning possibilities.

Abstract: In Viet Nam, standards of nursing care fail to meet international competency standards. This increases risks to patient safety ( eg. hospital acquired infection), consequently the Ministry of Health identified the need to strengthen nurse education in Viet Nam. This paper presents experiences of a piloted clinical teaching model developed in Ha Noi, to strengthen nurse led institutional capacity for inservice education and clinical teaching. Historically 90% of nursing education was conducted by physicians and professional development in hospitals for nurses was limited. There was minimal communication between hospitals and nursing schools about expectations of students and assessment and quality of the learning experience. As a result when students came to the clinical sites, no- one understood how to plan their learning objectives and utilise teaching and learning approaches appropriate to their level. Therefore student learning outcomes were variable. They focussed on procedures and techniques and " learning how to do" rather than learning how to plan, implement and evaluate patient care. This project is part of a multi- component capacity building program designed to improve nurse education in Viet Nam. The project was funded jointly by Queensland University of Technology ( QUT) and the Australian Agency for International Development. Its aim was to develop a collaborative clinically- based model of teaching to create an environment that encourages evidence- based, studentcentred clinical learning. Accordingly, strategies introduced promoted clinical teaching of competency based nursing practice utilising the regionally endorsed nurse core competency standards. Thirty nurse teachers from Viet Duc University Hospital and Hanoi Medical College participated in the program. These nurses and nurse teachers undertook face to face education in three workshops, and completed three assessment items. Assessment was applied, where participants integrated the concepts learned in each workshop and completed assessment tasks related to planning, implementing and evaluating teaching in the clinical area. Twenty of these participants were then selected to undertake a two week study tour in Brisbane, Australia where the clinical teaching model was refined and an action plan developed to integrate into both organisations with possible implementation across Viet Nam. Participants on this study tour also experienced clinical teaching and learning at QUT by attending classes held at the university, and were able to visit selected hospitals to experience clinical teaching in these settings as well. Effectiveness of the project was measured throughout the implementation phase and in follow up visits to the clinical site. To date changes have been noted on an individual and organisational level. There is also significant planning underway to incorporate the clinical teaching model developed across the organisation and how this may be implemented in other regions. Two participants have also been involved in disseminating aspects of this approach to clinical teaching in Ho Chi Minh, with further plans for more in- depth dissemination to occur throughout the country.

Abstract: This article explores how organizational policy capacity can be developed, drawing on a study conducted in a large human services agency in Australia. Building policy capacity within government agencies is widely acknowledged as important for successfully responding to complex policy problems. The existing literature suggests a range of strategies for building organizational capacity. Findings from interviews with policy workers support the principles for building policy capacity identified in the literature but uncovered a surprising degree of scepticism pointing to significant barriers to their realization. These barriers are identified as emerging out of the tensions between policy capacity and two other domains of governing capacity: administrative capacity and state capacity. These tensions however are highly contingent and dynamic; managing them requires a degree of discretion and judgement, in brief, policy leadership. A focus on developing policy leadership at the level of policy units and teams may present a strategic approach to building organizational capacity for policy work.

In this paper we present a theory of energy-related climate policy in democratic countries, emphasizing the distributional effects of policies on important energy-related industries, public sentiment, and the institutional capacity of governments, in determining energy-related climate policies implemented cross-nationally. As to the form of the policy, we expect the government to favor regulatory instruments over fiscal policies (taxes, subsidies) when it has enough institutional capacity in the relevant public agencies. For empirical evidence, we analyze national climate policies in four industrialized democracies: Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United States. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The current fabric of urban areas is largely the result of past land development and land-use planning decisions. Historically, there was relatively little consideration of the impact of these decisions upon hydrological systems within and outside urban areas. Despite their close relationship, urban and regional planning and water resources management have typically been carried out separately and guided by different institutional arrangements. The range of impacts of urbanisation on hydrological systems at the city-region scale, and the dependence of urbanised areas upon these systems, call for better integration between the sectors of urban and regional planning and water resources management to ensure the sustainability and resilience of cities and their regions to future changes and uncertainties. This paper evaluates the extent to which planning mechanisms currently support integration between land-use and water resource sectors. The evaluation draws on a comparative analysis of 113 statutory and non-statutory planning mechanisms in three Australian capital city-regions: South East Queensland, and the Melbourne and Perth Metropolitan regions. Results indicate that the function of water at the city-region scale, including its role in supporting environmental connectivity, needs to be better understood and considered by land-use planning systems; improved institutional capacity is required to enable both sectors to deal with future changes and uncertainties related to water resources; and emergent planning trends supportive of the consideration of water connectivity at the city-region scale are yet to be fully implemented. Based on the results, the paper concludes by exploring how the concept of urban metabolism may facilitate better integration between the two sectors, along with the identification of best suited planning mechanisms and needed changes in governance and institutional arrangements conducive to integration.

Abstract: Public spaces are the loci of complex interactions among multiple stakeholders whose decisions and activities affect places' qualities. The paper builds upon governance theory to provide a holistic in-depth approach in understanding the complexity and quality of the place-shaping processes in public spaces. In the absence of adequate conception of governance in urban design and public spaces, the paper introduces a framework for analysing governance capacity of public spaces and applies the framework to a flagship but highly contested public space in Brisbane, Australia namely South Bank Parklands. The proposed framework encompasses four major components of 1) actors and stakeholders, 2) governance structure, 3) governing tools, and 4) governing tasks. The framework puts special emphasis on the contextual factors, the way public spaces are shaped and governed, and political economy of the space. The case study application showcases the applicability of the PSGF which helps holistically analyse the trends in public space governance structure accounting for the diversity and complexity of all elements involved. The findings reveal that South Bank Parklands governance is mix-structured, hierarchical, and highly political. It is, however, a likeable public space for which civic engagement in the decision-making processes is notably limited.

Abstract: Successful river basin governance is challenged by actor engagement in the various stages of planning and management. A governance approach for determining priorities for actors for sustainable management was developed, based on a river basin diagnostic framework consisting of four social-institutional and four biophysical indicators. It was applied in river basins in Australia, Brazil, China and France. Actors diagnosed current and target capacity for these indicators, and estimated synergistic influences of interacting indicators. The results reveal different priorities and transformative pathways to achieve basin plan outcomes, specific to each basin and actor groups. Priorities include biodiversity for the Murray-Darling, local water management needs for the Sao Francisco and Yellow rivers, and improved decision-making for the Adour-Garonne. This novel approach challenges entrenched views about key issues and actor engagement roles in co-implementation of the basin plan under existing prevailing governance models, with implications for engagement and international collaboration on basin governance.

Abstract: Previous studies pay a little attention to whether the differences in national governance quality between home and host country substantially affect foreign bank performance. Based on a bank panel data with 375 foreign banks in 47 Asian countries between 2004 and 2019, the impact of the host-home country difference in governance quality on foreign bank performance is empirically investigated by considering the degree of banking competition measured with the Boone index. Using a panel data model with multilevel mixed-effects, this paper finds that foreign banks in Asia present higher profits than domestic banks. Specifically, banks locating in a less competitive host nation show higher profitability, while host-home differences in aggregated quality of national governance also significantly reduce the foreign bank profitability in terms of individual indicator for voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. Finally, foreign banks could gauge their market power in a less competitive banking structure in the host country to mitigate the negative influence of national governance between host and home country on their financial performance.

Abstract: Financial development is an inclusive objective for economies worldwide, but its connection with natural resources remains a topic of debate. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the impact of the resourcecurse hypothesis on economic development in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries during the period 1996 to 2021, given their substantial natural resources. Employing a cross-sectional ARDL (CS-ARDL) framework and validating the cointegration results with the Pedroni, Westerlund, and Kao Cointegration tests, this research surprisingly challenges the conventional wisdom of the resource-curse hypothesis. Instead, it reveals that natural resource rents can be beneficial for promoting financial development in highincome resource-rich economies. Furthermore, the study uncovers positive associations between financial development and key factors such as government effectiveness, regulatory quality, renewable energy adoption, economic growth, and urbanization. The findings underscore the significance of strong institutional frameworks in fostering financial development and offer valuable policy recommendations to enhance financial progress in OPEC countries.

Abstract: Romania ranks at the extreme low end in Eastern Europe in terms of Hofstede cultural insights, rule of law, government effectiveness, and corruption-potentially limiting governance quality for restricting resource channeling. In this paper, we examine whether these shortcomings flow over into the degree of corporate insider trading profitability at the firm level. Consistent with high power distance, low individualism, and voice and accountability, executives and their family members extract higher returns. The conjectured monitoring constraint of equity ownership had little impact on reducing profitable trading. Second, media reporting of firm-related scandals only restrained insider profitability in firms with government ownership-consistent with general forbearance of corruption and sanction from the use of politically controlled assets. Third, the global financial crisis revealed both a crisis of inept trading consistent with high uncertainty avoidance and also highly profitable trades for a limited set of executives who undertook short-term reversal strategies. Our exploratory microanalysis suggests a prototype to highlight areas requiring governance and investor attention in Eastern European countries.

Abstract: The extent of the economic distance between a firm's home origin and its foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important strategic decision for the investing firm. This study fills an important knowledge gap by investigating the home institutional antecedents of FDI economic distance. Drawing insights from comparative institutionalism, we argue that home-country states vary in both their power to coordinate the economy and the external and internal channels through which they exercise that power. These variations have implications on a firm's motivation and capability to escape external dependencies on the home-country state by investing in economically distant foreign locations. Empirically, using a dataset of 891 new international entrants from 2004 to 2011, we found support for our hypotheses that home-country state power is positively associated with FDI economic distance, and that the influence of the home-country state is contingent on the state's governance quality and its ownership in firms.

Abstract: New public management (NPM) has been the dominant orthodoxy in analysing public service reform with major implications for employment relations. Drawing on comparative studies of major OECD countries, including Australia, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United States, this article examines recent reforms of public service human resource management. It refutes the proposition that reforms indicate convergence towards an NPM model and argues that the 'varieties of NPM' thesis is also unconvincing. Several reform trajectories exist which have sought to modernize public sector pay, performance and working conditions, but these highlight the existence of alternative models rather than a shift towards NPM or even the emergence of 'varieties of NPM'.

At the same time, there are growing concerns on when intervention is most appropriate, the transaction costs of coordination, and the adequacy of institutional capacity at local levels, especially in developing countries. This article examines entry points and mechanisms for integrating concerns with climate change into local development planning in Cambodia. An institutional ethnography of the planning process indicates that subnational planning is participatory and flexible; and thus, provides plausible entry points to integrate climate change concerns. Case study methods applied to two externally supported, climate-resilient development projects identify promising mechanisms and strategies, as well as obstacles to integration. A vulnerability reduction assessment tool and top-up grant scheme both included promising deliberative and participatory elements from which lessons for future and elsewhere can be drawn. At the same time, key stakeholders concede that local integration more widely is hampered by multiple obstacles, including weak institutional capacity, low community participation, and lack of resources and incentives. Addressing these challenges requires political commitments for good governance, capacity development, and additional resources.

Abstract: The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has over 100 million Ha of forest and has significant potential to benefit from these forests, including through REDD+ if they are managed effectively. Effective governance of forest landscapes is essential for environmental management and equitable harnessing of ecosystem service benefits for communities. Poor governance, political instability, and capacity limitations in the DRC are widely highlighted. However, there have been few, if any, attempts to evaluate forest governance in the DRC, especially at the community level. This paper reports a community-level evaluation of forest governance in the DRC, using a survey method. The results suggest that REDD+ projects have the ability to improve forest governance as perceived by the community. The research shows that building the right capacity, consulting and accessing the needs of the community and building long-term projects and partnerships a key success factors. These findings and the novel approach to supporting communities to evaluate their governance are applicable to similar community-level forest governance contexts.

Abstract: With inefficient bureaucratic institutions, the effects of laws are hard to assess and incompetent politicians may pass laws to build a reputation as skillful reformers. Since too many laws curtail bureaucratic efficiency, this mechanism can generate a steady state with Kafkaesque bureaucracy. Temporary surges in political instability heighten the incentives to overproduce laws and can shift the economy towards the Kafkaesque state. Consistent with the theory, after a surge in political instability in the early 1990s, Italy experienced a significant increase in the amount of poor-quality legislation and a decrease in bureaucratic efficiency.

Abstract: Until recently, standards to guide nursing education and practice in Vietnam were nonexistent. This paper describes the development and implementation of a clinical teaching capacity building project piloted in Hanoi, Vietnam. The project was part of a multi-component capacity building program designed to improve nurse education in Vietnam. Objectives of the project were to develop a collaborative clinically-based teaching model that encourages evidence-based, student-centred clinical learning. The model incorporated strategies to promote development of nursing practice to meet national competency standards. Thirty nurse teachers from two organisations in Hanoi participated in the program. These participants attended three workshops, and completed applied assessments, where participants implemented concepts from each workshop. The assessment tasks were planning, implementing and evaluating clinical teaching. On completion of the workshops, twenty participants undertook a study tour in Australia to refine the teaching model and develop an action plan for model implementation in both organisations, with an aim to disseminate the model across Vietnam. Significant changes accredited to this project have been noted on an individual and organisational level. Dissemination of this clinical teaching model has commenced in Ho Chi Minh, with further plans for more in-depth dissemination to occur throughout the country. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In the Philippines, networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) are more complex than individual MPAs, primarily due to involvement of multiple governance units. Hence, there is a need to understand the influence of governance context of networks on management performance. We addressed this need indirectly by evaluating the participation of network members and the governance capacity of three MPA networks with varying sizes, histories, and compositions of local governments and constituencies. We defined participation as the involvement of local governments and other stakeholders in decision-making processes. We defined governance capacity as the ability to govern interactions of social, economic, and political processes and dynamics in a political unit. We used qualitative, semi-structured key informant interviews and focus group discussions to ascertain whether participation and governance capacity are influenced by network size, institutional arrangements, and social and political contexts. We found that the sizes of the MPA networks did not affect participation and governance capacity. Instead, participation and capacity were influenced by institutional arrangements and the socioeconomic and political contexts of the local governments involved. We found that less complicated network objectives and systems for engagement, more inclusive membership, better communication, incentive systems, and strong leadership enhanced participation and governance capacity.

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to identify the basis of regional competence in industry sectors that are not key performers at the national level. The paper examines the ICT sector in two regions: Dresden (Germany) and Adelaide (Australia). The performance of Australia and Germany in ICT is not high by OECD standards. However, both Dresden and Adelaide have some competence in parts of the ICT sector that departs from national patterns. In Dresden the development of the ICT sector is more advanced than in Adelaide. In both regions, there are distinctive institutional features and policies that explain the development of the ICT sector. Further, in Dresden, the state has coordinated the ICT sector within the regional space, giving focus to institutional strengths in research and training, such that it is possible to describe the institutional environment as 'thick and coherent'. As such, the regional space of Dresden has experienced an agglomeration of ICT and can be regarded as more successful than Adelaide, where institutions and state initiatives are fragmented and incoherent.

Abstract: Viewed as an economic long march from poverty to middle-income status, China's four decades of rapid economic growth can seem little short of miraculous. Unsurprisingly, such a record is bound to inspire imitators, and China's political-economic model of authoritarian capitalism or state-sponsored neoliberalism has attracted many admirers in Africa. But viewed as a rapid rebound after the removal of catastrophic Maoist economic mismanagement, China's growth spurt has done little more than bring China up to the level of other semiperipheral countries in Asia, the post-Soviet space, and Latin America. China's economy rapidly grew to a level commensurate with its state capacity, and it is now leveling out at that level. The low levels of state capacity that have historically prevented most African countries from reaching middle-income levels of GDP per capita still prevail, and until these change, African countries will not be able to follow China into middle-income status.

Abstract: Over the past two millennia successful pre-modern states in Eurasia adopted and cultivated Big-God religions that emphasize (i) the ruler's legitimacy as divinely ordained and (ii) a morality adapted for large-scale societies that can have positive economic effects. We make sense of that development by building on previous research that has conceptualized pre-modern states as maximizing the ruler's profit. We model the interaction of rulers and subjects who have both material and psychological payoffs, the latter emanating from religious identity. Overall, religion reduces the cost of controlling subjects through the threat of violence, increases production, increases tax revenue, and reduces banditry. A Big-God ruler, who also is a believer, has stronger incentives to invest in expanding the number of believers and the intensity of belief, as well as investing in state capacity. Furthermore, such investments often are complementary, mutually reinforcing one another, thus leading to an evolutionary advantage for rulers that adopted Big-God religions.

Abstract: For reporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2004, Australian companies were required to disclose the expected impact of applying Australian equivalents of International Financial Reporting Standards effective from 1 January 2005. The objective of this paper is to examine the association between the level of disclosure and corporate governance quality. Using a sample of listed companies with 30 June balance dates, we find that the quantity of disclosure was positively related to some aspects of superior corporate governance, such as the frequency of board and audit committee meetings and the choice of auditor.

Abstract: In an international setting of developing countries, applying advanced statistical estimation approaches such as the system generalized method of moments (GMM), two-stage least square (2SLS) regressions, and cluster analysis, this paper revisits the impact of macro-level governance quality and the corruption index on the economic growth rate. We use cross-country panel data for 40 sub-Saharan and the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries over the period of 2009-2020. The empirical results document the positive and negative effects of the national governance index and the corruption index on the economic growth rate. Additionally, foreign direct investment and population have a positive impact on the economic growth rate and trade openness has a negative impact. The study evaluates the robustness of these associations through a series of tests. These findings have important policy implications for policymakers and regulators in developing countries. In particular, the study recommends the implementation of an anti-corruption campaign and improving country-level governance quality that could encourage increased foreign direct investment for an accelerated economic growth rate. These will further enhance accountability, transparency, the rule of law, social responsibility, the public voice, and government effectiveness.

Abstract: The study reported herein examines the impact of two central corporate governance mechanisms (internal audit function quality and board of directors' quality) on the incidence of earnings management. Unlike most prior studies in the area, focused mainly on US firms, this study looks at European firms that are cross-listed in the US and covers a long time span - before and after major changes were implemented in corporate governance policies (Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US and the 8th Company Law Directive in the European Union). Using novel and comprehensive measurement approaches for internal audit function quality and board of directors' quality, we find that both mechanisms have a negative direct effect on the incidence of earnings management, while their interactive effect is positive. A longitudinal analysis of both mechanisms also reveals that internal audit function quality and the quality of boards of directors have increased significantly since the policy changes.

Abstract: How do some places with weak institutional capacity avoid being caught in the cycles of violence and criminality so often associated with African institutions in the failed states' literature? This paper exploits in-country variation in piracy incidence across different regions of Somalia to investigate how some territories with low state capacity can nonetheless deter piracy and provide relative order. We find that the usual explanation - state failure' in Somalia, compared with a reasonably functional government in Somaliland - does not withstand scrutiny. Somaliland's lack of piracy was not due to strong' state institutions, but can be attributed to the strength of a discourse that emphasises Somaliland's inherent' capacity for order against the disorder supposedly endemic to the rest of Somalia. The exploration of the discursive underpinnings of Somaliland's supposed piratelessness' has implications for understanding the relationship between state institutions, political order and violence, particularly where the state does not exercise a monopoly on force.

Abstract: The policy problems posed by a lack of state capacity in developing societies now attract the attention of a growing number of scholars. Both the government failure paradigm, with its "top-down" emphasis, and the social capital theory, with its stress on "bottom-up" approaches, provide analytical frameworks that can be used to comprehend the symptoms of state incapacity reported by the much broader literature on policy implementation. This paper seeks to determine the implications of the government failure and social capital models for policy implementation. More specifically, the paper considers the contractualist approach to public management reform in New Zealand as the epitome of a top-down solution to government failure. it will also evaluate this model from a social capital perspective and suggest ways in which a balanced approach to public sector reform can take into account elements of both paradigms.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Power paradox: how the extension of US infrastructural power abroad diminishes state capacity at home

Abstract: The concept of infrastructural power is arguably one of the most useful in the social sciences. It has helped both to illuminate the extraordinary capacity, reach, and impact of the modern state vis-a-vis its pre-industrial predecessor, and to cast light on why some modern states appear more able than others to execute their decisions and pursue their ambitions. Although sometimes mischaracterized as a 'weak' state, the capacity of the state centered on Washington to penetrate social space and implement its decisions, both at home and abroad, has long been recognized. But under what conditions might its infrastructural power diminish? Arguably, US economic power is now stronger than ever, ostensibly bolstered by being home to the world's most globalized and most profitable companies. However, while globalized production has strengthened US corporations - especially those rich in intellectual property - its contradictory consequences for the state's infrastructural power deserve close examination. This paper takes a first step in that direction by appraising the extent to which the state's domestic capacities have been weakened by Washington's internationalization of intellectual property rights. It also offers a reconceptualization of US power.

Abstract: This article analyses the redistributive efficiency of social transfers and direct taxation in a panel of 28 developed economies during the period 1995-2010. In order to explore how redistribution is achieved through these fiscal policies, a two-stage approach is applied. First, we evaluate their redistributive efficiency - the degree of redistribution attained for a given level of transfers and taxes - using data envelopment analysis (DEA). We find lower redistributive efficiency in Southern Europe and the United States and higher efficiency levels in the Nordic and Central European countries and Australia. Second, we use panel regression analysis to identify the determinants of efficiency differences and reveal the crucial role of government quality as well as factors affecting the redistributive profile of fiscal policies.

Abstract: The study examines the effect of compliance with national governance frameworks on the relationship between corporate governance and the performance of publicly traded companies in Ghana. A sample of 31 companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange was drawn for the study based on their annual reports spanning from 2013 to 2022. A new national governance quality index composed of items drawn from world governance indicators and a corporate governance index was developed by principal component analysis. The study used the Huber M-estimation Robust Least Squares (HMRLS) regression method. The findings of our study reveal that corporate governance practices adversely affect the level of firm performance. However, our results demonstrate that compliance with national governance and institutional frameworks plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. The study offers managerial implications, as listed firms can adopt effective national governance and institutional quality practices to improve firm performance. This study investigates the relationship between corporate governance and business performance in Ghana, with a special focus on determining whether adherence to national governance frameworks has a significant impact. This research enhances the current understanding of corporate governance in Ghana and its impact on the performance of companies. This study offers useful information to policymakers, regulators, and business organisations in Ghana. This will result in improved corporate practices and greater performance of companies in Ghana. It will further aid stakeholders' comprehension of the significance of complying with national governance frameworks. Ultimately, the findings in this research would promote a culture of transparency, responsibility, and ethical behaviour in the business industry. This would enhance the overall economic progress and investor confidence in Ghana.

Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of CEO incentive-based compensation on earnings management, taking into account the influence of institutional settings and corporate governance systems. Design/methodology/approach - Using archival data of 3,000 British, Australian, German, and Austrian firm-years between 2005 and 2014, the study applies fixed-effect estimator to reduce risks of endogeneity bias. Findings - The findings reveal that institutional factors influence the relationship between CEO incentive-based compensation and earnings management. Particularly, firms from countries within the Anglo-American model (the UK and Australia), which provide greater protection for investor, stricter legal enforcement, and higher quality of corporate governance, tend to have lower level of earnings management. However, besides corporate governance quality, it is relevant to consider weaker investor protection and legal enforcement to motivate earnings management in firms from countries within the Euro-Continental model (Germany and Austria). Originality/value - The study suggests that robust implementation of corporate governance, derived from either model, helps in restraining CEO opportunistic behavior. Importantly, more qualified institutions have higher impact on the relative adequacy of CEO incentive-based pay formulas in mitigating earnings management concerns. This can be extended by future research through comparative studies using other contexts or influential institutions.

Abstract: The schools of government perform a central role to the public service of many countries. Despite being a disseminated and well-established phenomenon, the functions and even the concept of schools of government vary. Aiming to portray the functions and characteristics of schools of government around the world and offer a better understanding of them, this paper presents a comparative study of schools of government located across six continents. Based on purposive sampling, eight schools of government were selected to be part of this in depth study: Ecole Nationale d'Administration, ENA - France; Canada School of Public Service, CSPS - Canada; Instituto Nacional de la Administracion Publica, I NAP - Argentina; Australia and New Zealand School of Government, ANZSOG - Australia and New Zealand; Civil Service College, CSC - Singapore; National School of Government, NSG - South Africa; Direccao Geral da Qualificagao dos Trabalhadores em Fungoes Publicas, INA - Portugal; and Escuela Superior de Administracion Publica, ESAP - Colombia. Data collection procedures included interviews and document analysis. Data were analyzed using content and comparative analysis. This study highlights some important dimensions of schools of government including the position within the government, funding, main activities, organizational structure and personnel. Other similarities (e.g. among members of Commonwealth) and possible common trends and innovation challenges are also discussed. Finally, we discuss the results comparing them to previous studies findings.

Abstract: Fisheries have had major negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and effective fisheries management and governance are needed to achieve sustainable fisheries, biodiversity conservation goals and thus good ecosystem status. To date, the IndiSeas programme (Indicators for the Seas) has focussed on assessing the ecological impacts of fishing at the ecosystem scale using ecological indicators. Here, we explore fisheries Management Effectiveness' and Governance Quality' and relate this to ecosystem health and status. We developed a dedicated expert survey, focused at the ecosystem level, with a series of questions addressing aspects of management and governance, from an ecosystem-based perspective, using objective and evidence-based criteria. The survey was completed by ecosystem experts (managers and scientists) and results analysed using ranking and multivariate methods. Results were further examined for selected ecosystems, using expert knowledge, to explore the overall findings in greater depth. Higher scores for Management Effectiveness' and Governance Quality' were significantly and positively related to ecosystems with better ecological status. Key factors that point to success in delivering fisheries and conservation objectives were as follows: the use of reference points for management, frequent review of stock assessments, whether Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catches were being accounted for and addressed, and the inclusion of stakeholders. Additionally, we found that the implementation of a long-term management plan, including economic and social dimensions of fisheries in exploited ecosystems, was a key factor in successful, sustainable fisheries management. Our results support the thesis that good ecosystem-based management and governance, sustainable fisheries and healthy ecosystems go together.

Abstract: As rock bursts are unavoidable in deep mines and excavations with high in-situ stresses, ground support systems are implemented to manage and mitigate rock bursts. Cable bolts are commonly used as reinforcing elements in ground support systems, which are subject to dynamic loads in burst-prone excavations. To design an efficient cable bolt in burst-prone conditions, shear and energy absorption capacity must be considered. Numerical modelling is an advantageous method of repeatable testing and it is inexpensive and non-destructive. This study develops a statically and dynamically loaded numerical model of a double shear test in ABAQUS/Explicit. A total of 36 static and 576 dynamic tests are carried out, which examine the influence of bolt diameter, steel yield and ultimate strength, dynamic load velocity and dynamic load mass on the displacement, shear force and energy absorption capacity of cable bolts. As bolt diameter and steel yield strength increases, the maximum shear force resisted and bolt displacement increases. Similarly, as the mass and velocity of the dynamic load increases, the amount of energy absorbed by the cable bolt increases. The main novelty of the current research is to suggest a reliable computational tool to investigate the influence of the different key parameters in the cable bolts on the ultimate capacity. The suggested method is a significantly cost-effective technique compared with the experimental investigations.

Abstract: Local government in Australia has a strong collective capacity to reduce GHG emissions through policies, funding allocation to renewable energy projects and the delivery of programs and services. This study examines the institutional capacity of councils in Sydney and how this impacts on decisions to invest in alternative energy projects. We find greenhouse gas emission targets of councils are strongly aligned to national targets but do not reflect the local council's institutional capacity, political leadership or strategic priorities. Energy reduction projects are often identified and undertaken by environmental staff without support from financial staff or financial-evaluation tools. An absence of national guidelines to provide consistency in tracking and reporting limits cross-sector benchmarking. Street lighting contributes to a significant proportion of council's total electricity expenditure and GHG emission profile. Being highly regulated, existing contracts and the current practice of street lighting services limits the councils' ability to reduce emissions. Based on our analysis we recommend a number of measures to overcome these constraints including the use of financial evaluation tools for small-scale renewable energy projects, a standardised national tracking and reporting platform to facilitate progress-reporting and meaningful comparative analysis between councils and policy reform to the regulation of street lighting.

Abstract: This article assesses the relative merits of the reversal of fortune thesis, according to which the most politically and economically advanced polities of the precolonial era were subject to institutional reversal by European colonial powers, and the persistence of fortune view, according to which early advantages in state formation persisted throughout and beyond the colonial era. Discussing the respective arguments, the article offers a synthesis: the effect of early state formation on development trajectories was subject to a threshold condition. Non-European states at the highest levels of precolonial political centralization were able to resist European encroachment and engage in defensive modernization, whereas states closest to, yet just below, this threshold were the most attractive targets for colonial exploitation. Since the onset of decolonization, however, such polities have been among the first to regain independence and world patterns of state capacity are increasingly reverting to those of the precolonial era.

Abstract: Harvest strategies, also referred to as management procedures, are foundational to evidence-based fisheries decision making. Together with closed-loop simulation testing, termed Management Strategy Evaluation, of potential harvest strategies, they are considered to be best practice. However, the use of these approaches is still mostly limited to a small minority of high-value, data-rich stocks in developed economies. The Indonesian tropical tuna fisheries provide a rare real-world experience where formal empirical harvest strategies were being developed for data-limited fisheries within a developing economy as an operational management tool. The Harvest Strategy Framework is a departure from a previously open-access fishery for tropical tuna in Indonesian archipelagic waters. It outlines the necessary actions to operationalize the harvest strategy, including fisheries monitoring, harvest control rules, associated management measures to meet the management objectives, and immediate actions to reduce the levels of catch as a precautionary measure until the harvest strategy is fully implemented. It was developed over a 9-year national consultative process, commencing in 2014 and culminating in the official adoption of the framework in June 2023. This paper outlines key processes and challenges encountered in stakeholder engagement and technical capacity development within the intricate governance context of Indonesia. We argue that the engagement processes have cemented a future direction towards sustainable and best practice fisheries management in Indonesia and the effective co-production process has potential to show the way for other fisheries in coastal developing states who face similar challenges in managing their national and internationally shared stocks.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that democratic governments listen to their populations, while authoritarian governments do not. This paper questions the extent to which this dynamic applies in cases of government scandals, using the illustrative cases of China and Kenya. We expect democratic countries with free media to be responsive and authoritarian states to ignore public pressure. Counter to this expectation, however, authoritarian China is more responsive to public pressure to clean up scandals than democratic Kenya. Using case studies and quantitative analysis, we argue that while democracy and free media are important for government responsiveness to scandal, they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions. We assert that political will, state capacity to respond and high public expectations for state action are also necessary.

Abstract: Surveillance infrastructure in China monitors and enables authorities to react to potential risky, miscreant or criminal behaviour. What type of behaviours are perceived to be so, is determined in large part by ideology. Therefore, surveillance infrastructure relies on the machinery of ideology to define the boundaries of its use. In this paper, we outline six key ideological concepts relating to governance in Xi Jinping's China that have helped to expand the boundaries of surveillance. We identify terms embedded in promotional material of Hikvision and other surveillance technology firms as a springboard for conceptual discussion. The aim is to survey the ideological lexicon of concepts that position surveillance within the Party-state's broad capacity-building ambitions for governance in Xi's China. This positioning amplifies the political responsibility of state, social and market actors to work together to broaden surveillance activities for 'society-building' purposes, and ultimately for the realisation of Xi Jinping's goal of National Rejuvenation.

Abstract: Governing norms by which to steer traditional government functions are well established and understood; however, this is not the case for the new multi-level and collaborative approaches that characterize protected area governance. This is largely new territory that makes novel demands on governance institutions and policy. In this context, establishing and maintaining good governance across the diversity of ownership and responsibility arrangements is critical for the future effectiveness and acceptability of protected areas. Fulfilling the promise and avoiding the pitfalls inherent in contemporary protected area governance will require an understanding of what is meant by 'good governance' and development of associated mechanisms to assess performance and provide a basis for improvement. This paper's contribution lies in the guidance it provides for the hitherto under-developed area of governance quality assessment. I first present a framework that positions governance quality in relation to governance and management effectiveness. I then characterize good protected area governance according to a set of seven principles - legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, connectivity and resilience. Together, the framework, governance principles and related performance outcomes provide a platform for assessment of governance quality for an individual terrestrial protected area, a network of several protected areas, or a national protected area system.

Abstract: Vietnamese 'blue boats' - small wooden-hulled fishing boats - are now entering the territorial waters of Pacific Island countries and illegally catching high-value species found on remote coastal reefs. Crossing several international boundaries and traversing a distance of over 5000 km, these intrusions have alarmed Oceanic countries, including Australia. Lacking administrative capacity as well as jurisdictional authority to effectively control the vast stretches of island coastlines individually, governments and intergovernmental bodies in the region have called for strengthened coordination of surveillance efforts while also pressuring Vietnam diplomatically. This paper reviews these latest developments and is the first to provide a focused assessment of the issue. Through the lens of Copenhagen School of securitisation theory, we analyse responses of national and regional actors and their portrayal in online media to understand how blue boats are constructed as a security threat within a narrative of maritime, food and human security. Arguably, Australia together with the Forum Fisheries Agency, who advise on the governance of offshore tuna resources, have so far acted most decisively - in a way that might see them extend their strategic role in the region. We propose a comprehensive empirical research agenda to better understand and manage this nascent, flammable and largely unpredictable inter-regional phenomenon.

Abstract: Urbanization of China has been accelerated since the 1980s, the urbanization rate has got to 45.7% and it is still growth with stability. The fast urbanization has brought a lot of problems for the government, one is the contradiction between the city development and the city ecological environment, and the other is the contradiction between the survival of disadvantaged groups and the order of urban management. Then the author gave five advices to solve the problems, such as establish and improve organizational structures of urban management, make greater efforts to strengthen guidance of city planning and policy coordination, improve basic facilities of the city so as to provide high quality public goods, put forward a series of pluralistic policies and measures to boost employment, improve the existing social security system in cities.

Abstract: Canonical theories of bureaucracy demonstrate the need for enhanced monitoring in government hierarchies. I argue that intensive top-down monitoring may reduce the productivity of bureaucrats by frightening them away from the informal practices that they would otherwise rely on when completing daily tasks. Utilizing a unique dataset of sub-provincial inspections in China's recent anti-corruption campaign, I identify this "chilling effect" by exploiting variation in the timing of inspections from 2012 to 2017. I show that these anti-corruption activities lower the area of land development projects proposed by bureaucrats. Causal mediation analyses with investigation data and original measures of corruption potential reveal that these effects are unlikely driven by reduction of actual corruption. Extension analyses suggest similar consequences on revenue collection and environmental regulation. Although scholars of state-building equate low corruption with effective bureaucracy, these findings present a paradox where intensive state-led efforts to lower corruption may further undermine bureaucrats' productivity.

Abstract: Capacity building efforts in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are indispensable for the achievement of both individual and collective ocean-related 2030 agenda priorities for sustainable development. Knowledge of the individual capacity building and research infrastructure requirements in SIDS is necessary for national and international efforts to be effective in supporting SIDS to address nationally-identified sustainable development priorities. Here, we present an assessment of human resources and institutional capacities in SIDS United Nations (UN) Member States to help formulate and implement durable, relevant, and effective capacity development responses to the most urgent marine issues of concern for SIDS. The assessment highlights that there is only limited, if any, up-to-date information publicly available on human resources and research capacities in SIDS. A reasonable course of action in the future should, therefore, be the collection and compilation of data on educational, institutional, and human resources, as well as research capacities and infrastructures in SIDS into a publicly available database. This database, supported by continued, long-term international, national, and regional collaborations, will lay the foundation to provide accurate and up-to-date information on research capacities and requirements in SIDS, thereby informing strategic science and policy targets towards achieving the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) within the next decade.

Abstract: This paper examines the structures of capitalism in Southeast Asia. Following the lead of Gordon Redding and others, it argues that parallel to varieties of capitalism elsewhere, there are distinctive features to the Southeast Asian business system, but that institutions play a relatively large role compared to firm specific resources or industry structures. Historically, with the exception of Thailand all the countries in the region are former colonies. All including Thailand share a distinctive style of nationalism, and partly as a result of this, all are governed by states that claim to be strong and lay wide claims but whose capacities are low. Typical features of the region, particularly the roles of large business groups and the Chinese minority, also can be interpreted as a result of this history. One of the outcomes of the analysis is an extension of the varieties of capitalism approach along the dimensions of state capacity and state direction, and of the approach to the internationalizing firm along the dimensions of dynamic capacity and control of subsidiaries. A further outcome is a questioning of the traditional picture of indigenous Southeast Asian business people as lacking in entrepreneurial skills, or more broadly of Southeast Asian nations as lacking in entrepreneurial values. Rather, the past history of these countries has resulted in a set of structures that militate against successful entrepreneurial activity.

Abstract: Objectives Diabetic eye disease is a leading cause of blindness but can be mitigated by regular eye assessment. A framework of issues, developed from the literature of barriers to eye assessment, was used to structure an examination of perceptions of a new model of care for diabetic retinopathy from the perspective of staff using the model, and health professionals referring patients to the new service. Design Multimethod: interviews and focus groups, and a separate survey. Setting A new clinic based on an integrated model of care was established at a hospital in outer metropolitan Sydney, Australia in 2017. Funded jointly by Centre for Eye Health (CFEH) and the hospital, the clinic was equipped and staffed by optometrists who work alongside the ophthalmologists in the existing hospital eye clinic. Participants Five (of seven) hospital staff working in the clinic (ophthalmologists and administrative officers) or referring to it from other departments (endocrinologists); nine optometrists from CFEH who developed or worked in the clinic; 10 community-based optometrists as potential referrers. Results The new clinic was considered to have addressed known barriers to eye assessment, including access, assistance for patients unable/unwilling to organise eye checks and efficient management of human resources. The clinic optimised known drivers of this model of care: providing clear scope of practice and protocols for shared care between optometrists and ophthalmologists, good communication between referrers and eye professionals and a collegial approach promoting interprofessional trust. Remaining areas of concern were few referrals from general practitioners, fewer referrals from hospital endocrinologists than expected and issues with stretched administrative capacity. There were also perceived mismatches between the priorities of hospital management and aims of the clinic. Conclusions The new model was considered to have addressed many of the barriers to assessment. While there remain issues with the model, there were also unexpected benefits.

Abstract: For Tasmanians accessing Government services has traditionally required visits to various Lead Agency locations, as service delivery was fragmented and bureaucratic. The Tasmanian Government adopted a customer-focused approach implementing 'Service Tasmania' a One-Stop-Shop service delivery concept. This paper investigates what led to the success of this public service reform and in particular what change management practices were applied during the change effort. Ten common factors of successful change have been identified in the literature; these are explored determining their relevance throughout this initiative. Data were collected with semi-structured interviews conducted with 63 staff plus senior management. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach and open coding was applied during the first pass through the data to reach the initial codes identifying critical terms and generic key issues. Findings confirm that several management interventions were necessary to address resistance and conflict issues and keep the government reform project on track.

Abstract: This report examines the conditions of appointment and termination of departmental secretaries in the APS and considers the impact of these conditions on: the secretaries themselves; the potential pool from which secretaries are drawn, and the likely continuing influence on the way in which the APS operates. The report is based on reviews of the literature on the appointments of departmental secretaries and of the legislative changes made in the last decades. It also draws from a series of interviews with 20 past and present secretaries. The interviews were conducted in October and December 1996, after a number of secretaries had been terminated by the new government but in most cases before the government paper on public service reform was released. The report is divided into two main sections. the first section analyses the changing conditions of service and tenure, the appointment and termination of secretaries and pay and conditions, the second section analyses the impact of the changes under three headings and explores the future implications.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how local government bodies in Nepal are empowered to play their constitutional roles and engage in activities to deliver public services at the doorsteps of the people effectively. The focus is on the institutionalisation of federalism, its implications for local governance, and capacity development of local authorities. Design/methodology/approach Ideas of decentralisation, governance and public management have been used to interpret findings based on qualitative research methods by key informant interviews, focus group discussions and personal observations conducted in five selected municipalities in Nepal. Findings The process of operationalising the power of local government bodies is more conventional and hierarchic. At the same time, the formulation and implementation of inclusive plans and budgeting are confined with certain formalities that do not necessarily allow citizens the space for voices. Federal government grants constrain fiscal jurisdiction and control over resource mobilisation. The mere preparation and administration of local government legislation and relevant by-laws have weakened the capacity of local government bodies. Originality/value From interpretation of first-hand data, this paper has identified the pitfalls of the federalisation process, the constraints deter the devolution of power to local bodies as well as the transformation of local governments into autonomous institutions in Nepal.

Abstract: Reform of the public service has not been just some management fad, nor is it even driven by purely management considerations. Fundamentally, public service reform, both in the last decade and in the future, is being driven by basic changes in our society, economy and technology which in turn influence what the public expects from government. The reforms of she last decade or so have concentrated on changing the management framework and culture. Future reforms are likely to impact more heavily on the responsibilities of the APS and what it actually does. However, the underlying rationale will continue to be to ensure the delivery of services which respond more effectively to the needs of the community.

Abstract: This study examines the role of resource abundance in the cross-country differences in the impacts of the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009. Using forecasts from the unobserved components model and exponential smoothing technique, we estimate the output levels a country would reach in 2009 and 2013 in the absence of the GFC, and compare these with the realised output levels. We find large variations in the output losses across 72 countries. The mineral-rich countries have been found to be in a strong position to survive any adverse shocks stemming from the GFC. Income per capita, trade openness, and institutional quality and government effectiveness are also found to be key factors determining the differences in output loss in the post-crisis period. These findings have strong implications for resource-rich countries such as Australia and are expected to shed new light on alternative policy designs and appropriate strategies to deal with any future economic crisis.

Abstract: This study examines whether the effectiveness of board subcommittees is associated with director attrition and the attraction of new directors to boards. Using a sample of firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, we find that nomination and remuneration committee effectiveness is inversely associated with director attrition and positively related to new external directors joining boards. The results suggest the contribution of these subcommittees to improve corporate governance by strengthening the board's human capital through recruitment and retention of suitable talent. Furthermore, the influence of subcommittee effectiveness on attrition (attraction) is more pronounced in firms experiencing higher levels of information asymmetry, weaker governance quality and poorer performance. The results are robust to tests with alternative variables, entropy balanced matching, and additional controls. Overall, our findings show that improved governance through effective subcommittees helps maintain and enhance the human capital of boards.

Abstract: Since the 1980s, globalization and its effects on development in Kenya have had mixed returns; key among them was an accelerated momentum to recognize citizen contribution to planning for their development and also citizen involvement in resource mobilization for development. In this regard, the country adopted policies which included decentralized development through the District Focus for Rural Development, introduction of cost-sharing in the Education and Health sector, among other initiatives. In the 1990s, the Kenya government implemented another wave of reform driven by global realities of concern for increased development funding matched with decreasing wage bill. Actions towards reducing the wage bill included public service staff reductions and payroll cleansing especially in local authorities. One of the key lessons from these reform approaches was that, without elaborate stakeholder involvement and ownership of the development agenda, the reform initiatives were achieving negligible returns to development. Consequently, the next phase of reforms started in 2003 focused primarily on citizen engagement, public private sector partnerships and civil society active participation in reforms targeting the key pillars of public administration in Kenya, namely: (1) Institutional strengthening across the public sector (2) Governance, law and Order (3) Information management (4) Public Service accountability to citizens (5) Strengthening Public Sector Integrity (6) Political restructuring through new constitutional dispensation (7) Public Private sector congruence for development The experiences, successes and challenges realized in these new reform initiatives shall be the focus of my paper. In particular, I shall provide personal insights based on my experience as a public administrator, public officer, researcher, trainer and consultant in public administration, management and leadership. For over 20 years, I have lived the reform waves in Kenya and can witness how increased citizen participation in the governance of states must be the norm if countries are to develop faster and relevantly. The paper shall discuss different methods of citizen and stakeholder engagement that works and the challenges inherent; in addition the paper shall review Kenyan experience in involving private sector players to strengthen public service administration and management especially in the last decade.

Abstract: The issue of why so many young adolescents around the world are disengaging from school and making the choice to drop out is one of the most intractable, vexed, perplexing, and controversial issues confronting educators. Tackling it requires courage and a radical rethinking of school reform around issues of power, ownership of learning, and the relevance of schooling and curriculum for young lives. This means a heightened institutional capacity to "listen." This article describes an instance of a disadvantaged urban Australian government school that realized it had little alternative but to try new approaches; "old ways" were not working. The article describes an ensemble of school reform practices, philosophies, and strategies that give young adolescents genuine ownership of their learning. This school stands out as a beacon that school reform is possible, even for young adolescents from the most difficult of circumstances. However, such approaches look markedly different from where mainstream educational reform is taking us at the moment.

Abstract: Several recent works have emphasised new relations of hierarchy within international society, primarily involving the claim by certain Western states of the authority to intervene in particular territories in order to build state capacity and the institutions of sound liberal democratic governance. While several scholars have identified these new hierarchies, few have provided a satisfactory account of what informs their formation and reproduction. This article investigates why new hierarchies have emerged within international society, arguing that they are underpinned by a 'liberal social logic of risk', which simultaneously constructs liberal democracies as inherently peaceful and prosperous and non-liberal or weak states as inherently risky and dangerous. Confronted by new forms of debounded security risks, Western societies have sought to manage these risks via interventions in identified 'risky zones' aimed at building liberal political and economic institutions. This argument is illustrated by the example of Australia's new interventionist development agenda in the Asia-Pacific, notably its leading role in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). This interventionist agenda is, in effect, a new mechanism of regional risk management that informs new modes of hierarchical governance in the Asia-Pacific.

Abstract: Africa is on the verge of a mining boom. We review the environmental threats from African mining development, including habitat alteration, infrastructure expansion, human migration, bushmeat hunting, corruption, and weak governance. We illustrate these threats in Central Africa, which contains the vast Congo rainforest, and show that more than a quarter of 4,151 recorded mineral occurrences are concentrated in three regions of biological endemismthe Cameroon-Gabon Lowlands, Eastern DRC Lowlands, and Albertine Rift Mountainsand that most of these sites are currently unprotected. Threats are not uniform spatially, and much of the Congo Basin is devoid of mineral occurrences and may be spared from direct mining impacts. Some of the environmental impacts of African mining development could potentially be offset: mining set-asides could protect some wildlife habitats, whereas improving transportation networks could increase crop yields and spare land for conservation. Research and policy measures are needed to (1) understand the synergies between mining and other development activities, (2) improve environmental impact assessments, (3) devise mitigation and offsetting mechanisms, and (4) identify market choke points where lobbying can improve environmental practice. Without careful management, rapid mining expansion and its associated secondary effects will have severe impacts on African environments and biodiversity.

Abstract: We survey the recent economics and history literature on the Chinese state to investigate its role in China's long-term socioeconomic development. We highlight three insights. First, unlike in Europe, where interstate competition helped give rise to capitalist states with high capacity, the Chinese state emerged from a different historical context. Second, the 18th- and 19th-century Chinese state does not fit into the mould of a strong and extractive Oriental despotic state as once commonly believed. By conventional measures, early modern China had a weak state. Third, state building and centre-local relations are two useful dimensions to understand development and change in China's recent history and political economy. To adapt China to a changing world, Chinese state builders embarked on a long process of state building from the late-19th century through the Republican and Communist eras. Facilitated partly by regional decentralisation, the process now sees the Chinese state playing a substantially larger role in the economy and everyday life than any previous time in history.

Abstract: Water markets have featured prominently in the reallocation of water rights to restore freshwater ecosystem health. incentive-based water rights acquisition and transactions have emerged as a market-oriented policy approach to reallocate water resources from existing uses to enhance the provision, regulation, and sustainability of freshwater ecosystem services. This paper develops a conceptual framework to examine factors enabling and constraining successful policy reform and implementation in market-based environmental water allocation. This analysis distills and extends the findings and lessons of a September 2007 workshop in Brisbane, Australia on environmental water transactions. Two case studies were selected in water stressed basins - the Columbia (U.S.A) and Murray-Darling (Australia) Basins - where transactional approaches to environmental water allocation first emerged. The case studies draw upon practitioner perspectives and previous policy and economic analysis in two regions where shared political economic and physical conditions lend a strong analytical basis for comparison. A common set of policy and regulatory reforms has occurred in both cases - albeit in different forms and via distinct paths - to develop three enabling conditions: (1) establishment of rights to and limits on freshwater extraction and alteration; (2) recognition of the environment as a legitimate water use; and (3) authority to transfer existing water rights to an environmental purpose. However, these elements of policy reform are necessary but not sufficient for effective implementation; a second set of driving forces, barriers, and adaptations explains the ability to achieve larger scale ecological outcomes. These conditions include the physical, social and economic factors driving demand for environmental water allocation: administrative procedures, organizational development and institutional capacity to effect transfers; and adaptive mechanisms to overcome legal, cultural, economic, and environmental barriers. The case study analysis suggests that environmental water transactions can play an important role in establishing environmental water allocations, although water markets require ongoing institutional capacity and adaptive governance. The conceptual framework and empirical lessons generated through this cross-case comparison provide the basis for an expanded research agenda to evaluate the design and performance of market-oriented reforms as implementation experience accrues and new programs emerge in diverse ecological and political economic settings.

Abstract: Aims To explore and identify the core elements of the nurse executive role and the contribution these posts make to health service organisations in terms of quality and performance. Background With the ongoing global reform of health services and, in particular, currently in Australia, this commentary paper explores the available evidence that explains and describes the role that nursing leaders can and do play at executive level in enabling quality services in high performing health-care organisations. Evaluation While the overall literature is limited in relation to the role and function of nurse executives, there are strong and recurrent themes indicating that nurses by virtue of their professional background and experience can provide effective and influential input to executive boards. Executive nurses are well positioned to influence and lead professional governance, quality improvement, service transformation and change and shared governance. Conclusion At a time when the role of nursing executives may be questioned, the evidence supports the positive impact of highly skilled nursing executives in contributing to the implementation of effective health services. Successful health services should be engaging nurse executives who have the high level of expertise, education, the best leadership and management attributes to bring the art and science of nursing to produce outcomes for organisations. Implications for nursing management Nurse executives must remain alert to the ongoing challenges and potential questioning on the value that nurses can bring to an executive board. The framework of nursing executive influence and leadership through professional governance, quality improvement, service transformation and change and shared governance is one possible approach that nurse executives may wish to apply to articulate their contribution and value in remaining at the executive board table.

Abstract: The increasing global demand for critical minerals, driven by the energy transition and digitisation, can be a double-edged sword for resource-rich African countries (RRACs). While these countries possess abundant reserves of these minerals, they face a critical decision point. They must adapt their policies to leverage these resources for economic development in a rapidly changing landscape, at the same time balancing national interests with global call for decarbonisation. Simultaneously, the global shift towards renewable energy sources threatens to diminish the market for coal and gas resources, which are abundant in RRACs but underutilised. While this necessitates swift policy and strategic actions to facilitate resource utilisation for economic diversification, RRACs may find themselves in a race against time. Using insights from multi-stakeholder interviews and existing literature, this paper explores avenues for RRACs to industrialise and diversify their economies. The analysis underscores the significance of mineral and revenue utilisation; public-private collaboration; and regional strategies in investment, and supply and value chains for economic diversification in the context of energy transition.

Abstract: Terrorism is pervasive in Mali. The efforts by Mali to counter terrorism, however, have been inadequate. The lack of institutional capacity and the lack of a workable counterterrorism policy characterised by bad governance are identified as key inadequacies in the fight against terrorism in Mali. In view of these inadequacies, the article demonstrates the need for a continental approach to fight the threat of terrorism in Mali. But for the African Union (AU) to be effective in resolving the Malian impasse, its diplomatic, political, and military approaches have been discussed and critiqued. The article suggests the need to retool the security architecture of the AU - the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) - and particularly, to ensure the full operationalisation of the Common African Defence and Security Policy (CADSP) and the African Standby Force (ASF). Importantly, the AU must also have a counterterrorism fund dedicated to support the fight against terrorism in Mali and Africa as a whole.

Abstract: Of the variety of ways governments, organisations and artists are embedding art and culture within rural tourism strategy, public art trails have emerged as a popular form and approach. However, rural and remote local governments face challenges in realising possible benefits of arts tourism for their communities. This article takes remote northern Australia art tourism initiative, the Savannah Way Art Trail, as a case study to consider principles for successfully connecting public art trails with tourism in remote communities. Processes of delivering the Savannah Way Art Trail are framed and discussed under three themes: 1) local government capacity and relationships; 2) listening to locals; and 3) the 'art' of creating and managing remote art trails. These themes are considered as recommendations that can provide ways to enact cultural policy in practice in remote communities, and opportunities for extending the potential for art trails to reflect and benefit those communities.

Abstract: Purpose As custodians of takaful contributors' tabarru' (donation) funds, takaful operators are expected to fulfil a stewardship role propagated under the precepts of Islam. The purpose of this paper is to analyse takaful operators' stewardship, focusing on investment practices. Design/methodology/approach Structured interviews were conducted with senior investment staff from all of Malaysia's takaful operators. Questions, developed using Delphi-style techniques, allowed a five-point Likert scale response addressing specific issues revolving around seven dimensions of governance quality - using the Malaysian Rating Corporation's (MARC's) governance rating guidelines for Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). Interviewees' responses were assigned composite scores. Findings Malaysia's takaful operators score well on most prescribed governance quality dimensions, although performance varies between operators and across dimensions. Areas for improvement are identified, especially regarding disclosure of information and contributor involvement in takaful operators' management. Research limitations/implications - Predetermined questions restrict flexibility in obtaining takaful operators' information; however, end-of-interview, open-ended questions were asked to tap interviewee opinions on pertinent issues. A focus on takaful operators' governance quality and stewardship of investments means findings may not be representative of all operational aspects of their businesses. Practical implications - This study identifies governance quality guidelines which takaful operators may benchmark against and identifies where best to focus attempts to improve performance. These guidelines will also assist regulators assessing takaful operators' stewardship performance. Originality/value This study uses governance quality as an indicator of stewardship, a concept aligned with the precepts of Shariah.

While previous studies have demonstrated high predictive power of incorporating air travel data and governmental policy responses in global disease transmission modelling, factors influencing the decision to implement travel and border restriction policies have attracted relatively less attention. This paper examines the role of globalization on the pace of adoption of international travel-related non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the coronavirus pandemic. This study aims to offer advice on how to improve the global planning, preparation, and coordination of actions and policy responses during future infectious disease outbreaks with empirical evidence. Methods and data We analyzed data on international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 of 185 countries from January to October 2020. We applied time-to-event analysis to examine the relationship between globalization and the timing of travel restrictions implementation. Results The results of our survival analysis suggest that, in general, more globalized countries, accounting for the country-specific timing of the virus outbreak and other factors, are more likely to adopt international travel restrictions policies. However, countries with high government effectiveness and globalization were more cautious in implementing travel restrictions, particularly if through formal political and trade policy integration. This finding is supported by a placebo analysis of domestic NPIs, where such a relationship is absent. Additionally, we find that globalized countries with high state capacity are more likely to have higher numbers of confirmed cases by the time a first restriction policy measure was taken. Conclusions The findings highlight the dynamic relationship between globalization and protectionism when governments respond to significant global events such as a public health crisis. We suggest that the observed caution of policy implementation by countries with high government efficiency and globalization is a by-product of commitment to existing trade agreements, a greater desire to 'learn from others' and also perhaps of 'confidence' in a government's ability to deal with a pandemic through its health system and state capacity. Our results suggest further research is warranted to explore whether global infectious disease forecasting could be improved by including the globalization index and in particular, the de jure economic and political, and de facto social dimensions of globalization, while accounting for the mediating role of government effectiveness. By acting as proxies for a countries' likelihood and speed of implementation for international travel restriction policies, such measures may predict the likely time delays in disease emergence and transmission across national borders.

Abstract: This article examines the Xi Jinping-era stability maintenance behemoth called "Safe China." Safe China is a regime of activities that integrates "public order" policing and surveillance with "social governance." It is linked to the Chinese Communist Party's "Overall National Security Outlook" and its main task is "political security." Our analysis of Safe China recognizes integration as its main animating principle. Three elements of Safe China-its ideological rationale, its on-the-ground public order and social governance mechanisms, and the party's absolute leadership over its operation at the grassroots-are conducive to this integration process. Ultimately, through Safe China, the party is seeking to modernize its own governance capacity and embed its leadership more fully into grassroots society, to ensure long-lasting "peace and safety," not only for the nation but for itself.

Abstract: Well-established research into different models of capitalism has not been applied well to developing countries. Changing global conditions, institutional differences, and path-dependent histories have forced late developing countries to create models of their own. By and large, however, these models have been less than successful in fostering economic development through technological upgrading. A comparison of skills upgrading in several fast-growing economies in Southeast Asia suggests that perhaps there is a new "State Coordinated, Liberal Market Economy" developmental model that can successfully lead to upgrading-driven economic development. This model combines elements from the Developmental State, Coordinated Market, and Liberal Market Economy models while differing significantly from each.

Abstract: Objective Small Island Developing States (SIDS) struggle with implementing multisectoral tobacco control measures, and health sector actors often lack capacity to forge multisectoral commitment. This study aims to explore the sources and dynamics of authority that can enable multisectoral collaboration despite the divergence of policy agendas in tobacco control. Methods We applied a qualitative, explorative case study design, with data collection and analysis guided by an analytical framework that identifies sources and dynamics of authority. Seventy interviews were conducted in Fiji and Vanuatu between 2018 and 2019. Results The key features shaping multisectoral coordination for tobacco control in Fiji and Vanuatu are the expert, institutional, capacity-based and legal authority that state and non-state actors have in tobacco governance. The amount of authority actors can secure from these sources was shown to be influenced by their performance (perceived or real), the discourse around tobacco control, the existing legal tools and their strategic alliances. SIDS vulnerabilities, arising from small size, isolation and developing economies, facilitate an economic growth discourse that reduces health sector actors' authority and empowers protobacco actors to drive tobacco governance. Conclusions Our results highlight the need for terms of engagement with the tobacco industry to enable governments to implement multisectoral tobacco control measures. Expanding assistance on tobacco control among government and civil society actors and increasing messaging about the impact of economic, trade and agricultural practices on health are essential to help SIDS implement the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

Abstract: This paper presents the local institutional and organizational development insights from a five-year ongoing interdisciplinary research project focused on advancing the implementation of sustainable urban water management. While it is broadly acknowledged that the inertia associated with administrative systems is possibly the most significant obstacle to advancing sustainable urban water management, contemporary research still largely prioritizes investigations at the technological level. This research is explicitly concerned with critically informing the design of methodologies for mobilizing and overcoming the administrative inertia of traditional urban water management practice. The results of fourteen in-depth case studies of local government organizations across Metropolitan Sydney primarily reveal that (i) the political institutionalization of environmental concern and (ii) the commitment to local leadership and organizational learning are key corporate attributes for enabling sustainable management. A typology of five organizational development phases has been proposed as both a heuristic and capacity benchmarking tool for urban water strategists, policy makers, and decision makers that are focused on improving the level of local implementation of sustainable urban water management activity. While this investigation has focused on local government, these findings do provide guideposts for assessing the development needs of future capacity building programs across a range of different institutional contexts.

Abstract: The integration of urban water cycle management with urban planning and design is referred to as 'Water Sensitive Urban Design' or 'WSUD' in Australia; one of the key elements of WSUD is the management of urban stormwater. In early 2006, the Victorian Government released the Yarra River Action Plan, which allocated $20 million towards tackling urban stormwater pollution. To help ensure this money is allocated in an equitable and transparent manner across all metropolitan local governments a multi-criteria assessment tool has been developed. This paper presents an overview of the multi-criteria assessment tool developed and adopted for selecting WSUD projects that are eligible for funding through Melbourne Water's Stormwater Program. This tool considers three types of indicators: environmental, engagement (engagement with stakeholders and local government capacity building) and financial. Within each category, a series of indicators of different weightings are applied to score a project. Where initial concept designs do not meet the Program criteria, additional work is undertaken to refine and improve the project. The tool and its use are illustrated with a case study.

Abstract: This article evaluates the Brown-effect 'real' and 'potential' on public services production in the UK. It is observed, rather unsurprisingly, that Gordon Brown's approach to public services reform is a logical extension of the New Labour modernisation project and represents the extension of new public management (NPM) methods articulated in the populist rhetoric of 'choice', 'personalisation' and 'user' engagement. It is argued, however, that while the adoption of NPM was an important phase in the modernisation of Britain's public services, it is simply unequal to the challenge of public service provision in an era of networked governance. This is because it privileges the role of technocrats, takes the politics out of public policy deliberation and its market orientation is at odds with the concept of public service. In consequence, the success of public service reform rests on the development of representative as well as technocratic networks which can meet the demands of both representative democracy and the efficient delivery of public goods. A set of recommendations are advanced for these purposes rooted in a 'maximalist' ('deep democratisation') conception of public value.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Ticking time bombs: The MENA and SSA regions' geopolitical risks

Abstract: One of the major global challenges that most affect the world economies are geopolitical risks triggered by tensions arising from exploiting natural resources. This paper attempts to study the influences of global governance indicators (voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, the rule of law, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and control of corruption) on natural resource rents in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Middle East & North Africa (MENA). We apply a new panel quantile estimation technique to panel data from 62 countries from 1996 to 2021. The results show, in general, in both MENA and SSA economies, there is a negative perception of the quality of governance. This is due to several factors, such as the absence of popular participation and transparency in decision-making, political instability, violence and terrorism, low government efficacy, low-quality regulation, lack of the rule of law, and high corruption in these regions. Thus, governance quality could be the driver of geopolitical risks in resource-rich economies. This study adds to the literature on geopolitical risk by assessing the impact of the perceived quality of governance on natural resource income in the MENA and SSA regions. Furthermore, it is the first study to compare two regions, with many countries, regarding the effects of global governance indicators on natural resource rents. In addition, it has been empirically demonstrated that the deterioration of the quality of government is associated with increased revenues from the exploitation of natural resources, which increases the likelihood of geopolitical tensions. Higher quality and more effective governance require less complex, more transparent, and less contradictory regulations, reducing the likelihood of geopolitical tensions. Practical and policy implications are drawn from the findings to help the MENA and SSA economies overcome geopolitical risks.

Abstract: Using firm-level data from 23 developed markets, we document a positive association between overall firm-level governance quality and the informativeness of earnings announcements measured by abnormal stock return variance. This finding is robust after controlling for the potential endogeneity of firm-level corporate governance. Further analyses reveal that firms with strong governance show little evidence of earnings management, appoint Big 4 auditing firms, and attract analyst following, implying a positive link between strong corporate governance and the information quality of earnings announcements. Finally, there is some evidence that the relation between firm-level governance and market reactions around the announcements exists only in countries characterized by a transparent information environment and strong legal investor protection.

Abstract: This paper provides a quantitative analysis of stakeholder perceptions regarding the governance of the UN climate change negotiations on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+). Governance quality and legitimacy were evaluated by means of an online survey conducted in 2011, using a normative framework of principles, criteria and indicators. The paper concentrates on national-level stakeholders active in REDD+ in Nepal, and their perceptions of governance quality, with a discussion, given the focus of this special volume, that emphasizes inclusiveness, equality and resources (indicators of interest representation) and democracy, agreement and dispute settlement (indicators of decision-making). Respondents were selected from state (i.e. governmental) and non-state (i.e. civil society) interests from a range of sectors active in REDD+ at the national level. The results show that survey respondents generally found REDD+ to be inclusive, but did not consider that there was the necessary capacity, or resources, for meaningful participation. A concluding section reviews the framework applied, and comments on the nature of multi-stakeholder relations in contemporary global governance, and REDD+ specifically.

Abstract: BackgroundIndigenous young people worldwide possess unique protective factors that support wellbeing. However, they experience mental illness at higher rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. Digital mental health (dMH) resources can increase access to structured, timely, and culturally tailored mental health interventions by reducing structural and attitudinal barriers to accessing treatment. The involvement of Indigenous young people in dMH resource development is recommended, however, no guidelines exist on how this can best be facilitated.MethodsA scoping review examining processes to involve Indigenous young people in developing or evaluating dMH interventions was conducted. Studies reported between 1990 and 2023 involving Indigenous young people aged 12-24 years, originating from Canada, the USA, New Zealand, and Australia, in the development or evaluation of dMH interventions were eligible for inclusion. Following a three-step search process, four electronic databases were searched. Data were extracted, synthesized, and described under three categories: dMH intervention attributes, study design, and alignment with research best practice. Best practice recommendations for Indigenous research and participatory design principles derived from the literature were identified and synthesised. Included studies were assessed against these recommendations. Consultation with two Senior Indigenous Research Officers ensured Indigenous worldviews informed analysis.ResultsTwenty-four studies describing eleven dMH interventions met inclusion criteria. Studies included formative, design, pilot, and efficacy studies. Overall, most included studies demonstrated a high degree of Indigenous governance, capacity building, and community benefit. All studies adapted their research processes to ensure that local community protocols were followed and most aligned these within an Indigenous research paradigm. Formal agreements regarding existing and created intellectual property and implementation evaluations were rare. Outcomes were the primary focus of reporting, with limited detailed descriptions of governance and decision-making processes or strategies for managing predictable tensions between co-design stakeholders.ConclusionsThis study identified recommendations for undertaking participatory design with Indigenous young people and evaluated the current literature against these criteria. Common gaps were evident in the reporting of study processes. Consistent, in-depth reporting is needed to allow assessment of approaches for this hard-to-reach population. An emergent framework, informed by our findings, for guiding the involvement of Indigenous young people in the design and evaluation of dMH tools is presented.

Abstract: Social mobilization has long been considered a major characteristic of Chinese life and, more recently, a key aspect of China's state capacity. The existing literature on social mobilization in the country, however, is characterized by studies of pre-1978 China, many of which are scattered and fragmentary. This problem has not only resulted in misjudging the vital role of social mobilization as a process of change and an analytical construct, but has also overlooked the work of other researchers, especially those in China, studying a wide range of aspects of socio-economic and socio-political activities in present-day China. As a result, the research literature has not kept pace with the profound changes occurring in the country, providing no adequate theoretical foundation and capability for analyzing and theorizing the dynamics at work in contemporary China. This analytical article seeks to critically review the current state of knowledge relating to social mobilization in China and the main theoretical problems in the literature, paying special attention to the missing links between different perspectives. Resume Depuis longtemps, la mobilisation sociale est consideree comme l'une des principales caracteristiques de la vie chinoise et plus recemment, comme l'une des principales capacites de l'Etat chinois. Les articles qui traitent de la mobilisation sociale en Chine s'interessent principalement a la periode anterieure a 1978 et sont de nature disparate et fragmentaire. Cette lacune affecte la perception du role important de la mobilisation sociale comme processus de changement et de construction analytique et fait l'impasse sur les travaux d'autres chercheurs, notamment en Chine, consacres aux nombreux aspects des activites sociales, economiques et politiques dans la Chine d'aujourd'hui.

Resumen La movilizacion social se ha considerado desde hace mucho tiempo como una caracteristica principal de la vida china y, mas recientemente, como un aspecto clave de la capacidad estatal de China. Sin embargo, la literatura existente sobre la movilizacion social en el pais se caracteriza por estudios sobre la China anterior a 1978, muchos de los cuales estan dispersos y fragmentados. Este problema no solo ha conducido a juzgar mal el papel vital de la movilizacion social como un proceso de cambio y una construccion analitica, sino que tambien ha pasado por alto el trabajo de otros investigadores, especialmente los de China, en el estudio de una amplia gama de aspectos socioeconomicos y las actividades politicas en la China actual. Como consecuencia, la literatura de investigacion no ha seguido el ritmo de los profundos cambios que se estan produciendo en el pais, dejando de proporcionar tanto una base teorica adecuada como la capacidad para analizar y teorizar las dinamicas en funcionamiento en la China contemporanea.

Abstract: We examine the impact of options trading on audit pricing for a sample of US firms over the period from 2004 to 2021. We find that options trading is significantly and negatively related to audit fees, indicating that firms characterized by higher options trading incur lower audit fees. Auditors spend a lower number of days auditing firms with higher options trading and firms with higher options trading experience lower probabilities of lawsuits, and misstatements, and lower likelihood of material weaknesses and auditor opinion on internal controls. The impact of options trading on audit fees is stronger when the auditor is located further away from the audited firm, for firms with non-specialized auditors, higher information asymmetry problems, poorer earnings and lower governance quality. Overall, our findings underscore the significance of options trading in improving a firm's information environment and reducing litigation risk, resulting in lower audit fees.

Abstract: Small island developing states (SIDS) are among the most vulnerable in the world to the impacts of climate change. SIDS have prioritised adaptation to climate change as it is widely accepted that some climate change is inevitable. Given the high cost of adaptation and the financial constraints faced by SIDS, many have pursued international adaptation financing to meet adaptation costs and ease domestic constraints. This paper analyses international adaptation financing commitments to SIDS across multiple regions between 2010 and 2014. It has three aims. First, it identifies trends in this financing from Members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to SIDS. Second, using a multivariate regression model, it identifies the determinants of this financing to SIDS, compared to other developing countries. Third, it elicits the perspectives of policy-makers in SIDS on their experience with international adaptation financing to date. This study finds that (1) the allocation of funding and donor commitments to SIDS is highly skewed, (2) whether a country is classified as a SIDS is a determinant of the amount of adaptation financing it can expect to receive-other determinants include population, per capita income, governance quality and vulnerability, depending on how it is conceptualised and measured, and (3) SIDS are dissatisfied with the current levels of international adaptation financing and their experience with accessing it. This paper concludes that, while international adaptation flows have not been sufficient, SIDS have not been disadvantaged in their access to such financing over the period, compared to other developing countries.

Abstract: As literature on the 'shadow state' shows, the voluntary sector has long served as a necessary conduit through which states orchestrate the governance of various populations. However, relatively little is known about the active role that voluntary organisations play in shaping and mobilising the capacities of the state to advance their own projects and interests. We draw out aspects of post-structural theories of the state, and particularly assemblage thinking, that provide the conceptual and analytical tools with which to explore how voluntary organisations may exceed their common positioning as co-opted by, and subservient to, the state. Through empirical research on homelessness policy development in Australia, we show how locally embedded voluntary organisations in Australia and the United States acted strategically and engaged transnationally - through material practices and multi-sited labours - to create opportunities to shape formal state agenda at national and sub-national levels. The activities and influence of these voluntary organisations are illustrative of the assembled nature of state capacity.

Abstract: Information on deaths by age, sex, and cause are primary inputs for health policy and epidemiological research. Currently, most developing countries lack efficient death registration systems that generate these data on a routine and timely basis. The global community is promoting initiatives to establish and strengthen national mortality statistics programs across the developing world. Building human, technical, and institutional capacity to operate these programs are essential elements for the program. In Indonesia, the government has established a national Sample Registration System (SRS) covering a population of 9 million and is looking toward further scaling up of operations of the mortality statistics program in conjunction with expansion of the national Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems. This article reports the theoretical and practical perspectives gained from experiences in developing human capacity in the Indonesian context. These perspectives are described in terms of the institutional, personnel, and functional components of the program for collection, compilation, analysis, and utilisation of mortality and cause of death data. The article also describes the challenges and potential solutions for implementing capacity building activities at national and subnational level. In conclusion, the need for and availability of training resources are discussed, including the potential for involvement of public health academia and international collaborations within a research framework on program management, quality evaluation, and data utilisation. Adequate attention to capacity building is essential to ensure the success and sustainability of national mortality statistics programs. (C) 2019 Atlantis Press International B.V.

Abstract: This study examines the role of governance in transitioning from middle-to high-income status in 20 countries. All the growth models indicate that the rule of law plays a significant role. Significant interactions among government effectiveness were observed in the post-transition period. A significant effect of political stability and corruption control and a significant interaction effect of government effectiveness were also observed in the transition to high income, using extended Cox regression. The probit regression revealed that the interaction of low government effectiveness, low insurance, heavy reliance on agriculture, high fertility rates, high inflation, limited foreign investment and excessive public debt posed obstacles to achieving high-income status. The weak rule of law, corruption control and regulatory quality also affected the failure of the 42 upper-middle-income countries to reach a high-income level.

Abstract: Information on cause-specific mortality from civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems is essential for health policy and epidemiological research. Currently, there are critical gaps in the international availability of timely and reliable mortality data, which limits planned progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This article describes an evidence-based strategic approach for strengthening mortality data from CRVS systems. National mortality data availability scores from the Global Burden of Disease study were used to group countries into those with adequate, partial or negligible mortality data. These were further categorised by geographical region and population size, which showed that there were shortcomings in availability of mortality data in approximately two-thirds of all countries. Existing frameworks for evaluating design and functional status of mortality components of CRVS systems were reviewed to identify themes and topics for assessment. Detailed national programme assessments can be used to investigate systemic issues that are likely to affect death reporting, cause of death ascertainment and data management. Assessment findings can guide interventions to strengthen system performance. The strategic national approach should be customised according to data availability and population size and supported by human and institutional capacity building. Countries with larger populations should use an incremental sampling approach to strengthen CRVS systems and use interim data for mortality estimation. Periodic data quality evaluation is required to monitor system performance and scale up interventions. A comprehensive implementation and operations research programme should be concurrently launched to evaluate the feasibility, success and sustainability of system strengthening activities.

Abstract: Background: Telephone triage and advice services (TTAS) are increasingly being implemented around the world. These services allow people to speak to a nurse or general practitioner over the telephone and receive assessment and healthcare advice. There is an existing body of research on the topic of TTAS, however the diffuseness of the evidence base makes it difficult to identify key lessons that are consistent across the literature. Systematic reviews represent the highest level of evidence synthesis. We aimed to undertake an overview of such reviews to determine the scope, consistency and generalisability of findings in relation to the governance, safety and quality of TTAS. Methods: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for English language systematic reviews focused on key governance, quality and safety findings related to telephone based triage and advice services, published since 1990. The search was undertaken by three researchers who reached consensus on all included systematic reviews. An appraisal of the methodological quality of the systematic reviews was independently undertaken by two researchers using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. Results: Ten systematic reviews from a potential 291 results were selected for inclusion. TTAS was examined either alone, or as part of a primary care service model or intervention designed to improve primary care. Evidence of TTAS performance was reported across nine key indicators - access, appropriateness, compliance, patient satisfaction, cost, safety, health service utilisation, physician workload and clinical outcomes. Patient satisfaction with TTAS was generally high and there is some consistency of evidence of the ability of TTAS to reduce clinical workload. Measures of the safety of TTAS tended to show that there is no major difference between TTAS and traditional care. Conclusions: Taken as a whole, current evidence does not provide definitive answers to questions about the quality of care provided, access and equity of the service, its costs and outcomes. The available evidence also suggests that there are many interactional factors (e.g., relationship with other health service providers) which can impact on measures of performance, and also affect the external validity of the research findings.

Abstract: This paper investigates non-financial reporting in non-profit organisations. Specifically, it examines the extent to which UK higher education institutions (HEIs) make voluntary disclosures relating to risk management practices, and investigates whether composite governance quality index and senior management team characteristics can influence such risk disclosures. Using a sample of UK HEIs over a number of years and drawing insights from neo-institutional theory, our findings are three-fold. First, our baseline findings contribute to the literature by showing that the level of risk disclosure among HEIs in the UK is relatively low, especially when compared to the findings of prior studies that have been conducted on similar-sized publicly traded corporations. Second, we contribute to the literature by providing timely evidence on the impact of governance quality on risk disclosure. In particular, our evidence contributes to the existing literature by demonstrating that better-governed HEIs tend to engage in higher risk disclosures than their poorly-governed counterparts. Finally, our study contributes to the extant literature by providing new evidence that offers support for the "shared" governance model among UK HEIs. Specifically, our findings show that the positive governance quality-risk disclosure relationship is moderated/explained largely by the characteristics of the senior management team. Our findings are robust to controlling for endogeneities and alternative estimation techniques, with major implications for non-financial reporting.

Abstract: Pakistan's power sector has undergone significant reforms since 1994 to improve technical and financial performance. This study aims to measure the post-reform efficiency dynamics of electricity distribution utilities from 2015 to 2019 by taking Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) as a case study. The study also assesses the role of consumers' self-confidence in a particular business environment to participate as investors in the electric utility sector. The total factor productivity index and PLS-SEM approach were applied to validate the framework empirically. Results from the former show negative growth, as all index components remained negative except for efficiency change. It has been concluded that the standard of governance improves the business environment of the utility sector, which does not adequately describe the industrial performance of Pakistan's utility sector. Moreover, consumer self-confidence (e.g., information acquisition confidence and social outcome confidence) significantly mediates between the business environment and industrial output. Thus, consumer self-confidence is a prerequisite to maximizing industrial growth in the utility sector. Practitioners should launch a policy framework to enhance consumer self-confidence in the local context and, as a result, enhance the electric utility sector's industrial growth.

Abstract: Food systems and the communities they support are increasingly challenged by climate change and the need to arrest escalating threats through mitigation and adaptation. To ensure climate change mitigation strategies can be implemented effectively and to support substantial gains in greenhouse gas emissions reduction, it is, therefore, valuable to understand where climate-smart strategies might be used for best effect. We assessed mariculture in 171 coastal countries for vulnerabilities to climate change (12 indicators) and opportunities to deliver climate mitigation outcomes (nine indicators). We identified Northern America and Europe as having comparatively lower regional vulnerability and higher opportunity for impact on climate mitigation. Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway and the United States of America were identified as well-positioned to advance strategies linked to mariculture. However, the nature of vulnerabilities and opportunities within and between all regions and countries varied, due to the formation of existing mariculture, human development factors and governance capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that global discussion will be valuable to motivating climate-smart approaches associated with mariculture, but to ensure these solutions contribute to a resilient future, for industry, ecosystems and communities, local adaptation will be needed to address constraints and to leverage local prospects.This article is part of the theme issue 'Nurturing resilient marine ecosystems'.

Abstract: A well-functioning revenue system is a necessary condition for strong, sustained and inclusive economic development. However, the revenue systems in some developing countries have fundamental shortcomings. Using Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment data, this article provides a summary of the revenue raising capabilities across 58 developing countries. Tax reforms or tax system changes need to be made mindful of that current capacity. The optimal choice of tax regime may be different when administrative capacity is low. The increasing globalisation of economic activity adds a further layer of complexity that developing countries need to manage in building and maintaining their revenue systems. Finally, any proposals to change the revenue system in a developing country need to recognise that, like developed countries, tax reforms are highly political endeavours.

Abstract: This paper causally links petroleum dependence to political instability in developing countries through the three core characteristics of the rentier state?weak institutional capacity, a distributive political economy, and elite capture and predation. Traditional rentier state theory, centered primarily on the experiences of authoritarian, middle-income countries, holds that oil-rich regimes use their rents to secure political stability. By contrast, this paper argues that rentier practices can fuel rather than inhibit civil unrest in institutionally weaker developing countries. The causal pathway is demonstrated with field research-based process tracing of the case of TimorLeste. There, the apparently benevolent distribution of petroleum rents has secured some dimensions of peace but has also activated new vectors of political instability. Moreover, the predatory capture by political?economic elites of an expanding rent share provokes societal grievance and potential instability on another front. Weak institutional capacity makes the state less able to deal with these elements of domestic unrest. A major implication of this research is that even where the other factors known to interact with oil wealth in fueling conflict are scarce, petroleum dependence itself could contribute to political instability as a result of the rentier effects it puts in motion.

Abstract: Improving the energy efficiency of economies is the core of promoting global sustainable development. At present, improving energy efficiency is a common problem faced by all countries. In this paper, the Three-stage DEA model improved by radial slack based measure (SBM) model is used to evaluate the energy efficiency and influencing factors of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) members. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes of energy efficiency of each country are further explored by the Malmquist index model. The empirical analysis shows that the energy efficiency of China, Japan, and Australia are all 1, which is at the forefront of efficiency, while the energy efficiency of Vietnam is the lowest, which is 0.136. China's technological progress change index is 1.013, leading other countries. The results of the study are helpful to understand the trend of energy efficiency changes in various countries, to transform their energy efficiency advantages into the common advantages of each member state, and to improve the comprehensive governance capacity of energy efficiency of each country.

Abstract: Private nature reserves created by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are increasing, and their growing number and extent means that they can potentially contribute to biodiversity goals at a global scale. However, the success of these reserves depends on the legal, economic and institutional conditions framing their creation and management. We explored these conditions, and the opportunities and challenges facing conservation organizations in managing private nature reserves, across several countries, with an emphasis on Australia. Results from 17 semi-structured interviews with representatives of private conservation organizations indicated that while private reserves may enhance the conservation estate, challenges remain. Legal frameworks, especially tenure and economic laws, vary across and within countries, presenting conservation organizations with significant opportunities or constraints to owning and/or managing private nature reserves. Many acquired land without strategic acquisition procedures and secured funding for property acquisition but not management, affecting the long-term maintenance of properties. Other typical problems were tied to the institutional capacity of the organizations. Greater planning within organizations, especially financial planning, is required and NGOs must understand opportunities and constraints present in legislative frameworks at the outset. Organizations must establish their expertise gaps and address them. To this end, partnerships between organizations and/or with government can prove critical.

Abstract: Natural resource governance regimes are increasingly engaging various actors at multiple levels to address sustainability challenges. In this context, as a governance strategy, decentralisation - or the transfer of power from central to local authorities - is expected to improve service delivery, accountability, and participation. The paper examines whether decentralisation in wildlife refuge politics in Taiwan delivers these outcomes; what factors influence local governments' capacities and powers to manage Chiku wildlife refuge in Taiwan; and what accountability mechanisms decentralisation policies enable. Multiple levels of governance are resistant to decentralisation, due to lack of ability and resources, evolving incentive structures, and conflicting regulations in a fragmented jurisdictional context. According to the findings, local authorities are becoming less engaged, agencies involved lack coordination, and accountability mechanisms are inadequate. The potential benefits of decentralisation are therefore hard to achieve.

Abstract: Both government and international donor agencies now promote the use of tourism to alleviate poverty. The Botswana government has embraced tourism as a meaningful and sustainable economic activity and diversification opportunity, which now ranks second after mining in its contribution to the country's gross domestic product. The study reported in this paper investigates perceptions of stakeholders on the opportunities that would be created for the poor by opening up Botswana's forest reserves for ecotourism. Data was collected through mixed methods involving in-depth interviews with government departments, traditional leaders, quasi-government organisations and the Hospitality and Tourism Association of Botswana. Focus group discussions were also held with village development committees, Chobe Enclave Conservation Trust (CECT) and Kasane, Lesoma and Pandematenga Trust (KALEPA) members, and a consultative national workshop of stakeholders was also held. The findings indicate that opening up forest reserves for ecotourism has the potential to alleviate poverty among the disadvantaged groups living adjacent to forest reserves through direct (employment, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)), secondary (linkages/partnerships) and dynamic effects (sustainable livelihoods). The study concludes by cautioning that whilst pro-poor tourism may yield short- and medium-term benefits, in keeping with sustainability objectives, participants in the programme need to be mindful of forestry encroachment and come up with strategies to ensure the sustainability of the Botswana forest reserves.

Abstract: Understanding popular attitudes to climate change can be important in developing effective climate adaptation responses. However, in the Pacific region, which is at the forefront of impacts of a changing climate, little attention has been given to popular perceptions of climate change. This paper presents the findings of a climate change module in the first Pacific Attitudes Survey (PAS), conducted in Samoa from December 2020 to January 2021. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of Samoans of voting age (n = 1319), the PAS gauges the views of ordinary Samoans towards climate change, including perceptions of the urgency of climate change action, perceptions of the effects of climate change in Samoa, and of individual or institutional capacity to act on climate change. Findings reveal that while most respondents believe that climate change was an urgent problem that needs to be addressed, a significant minority thought it will "never be necessary" to address climate change. This study also found level of education to be a significant factor in climate beliefs. Respondents who had higher education levels were more likely to rate climate change as an urgent problem. Those identifying climate change as an urgent problem that needs to be addressed were significantly more likely to agree that climate change was affecting Samoa in general and their own personal lives. We also found a significant association between perceptions that climate change was an "urgent problem that needs to be addressed", and willingness to permanently migrate for work.

Abstract: In this paper I analyze investors' reactions to changes in the expense ratios of equity mutual funds. I show that investment flows' response to fees cannot be fully explained by looking at investors' performance sensitivity. While performance sensitivity monotonically increases with past performance, price sensitivity does not: investors who buy top past performers seem to be "distracted" by the fund's previous return and pay relatively little attention to the expense ratios. Moreover price sensitivity increases with fund visibility while performance sensitivity decreases, and while looking at data from 1986 to 2006 no discernible trend can be observed in the average performance sensitivity, price sensitivity strongly increases due to the dramatic increase in the availability of mutual funds' information for retail investors. Finally I show that investment companies strategically time their repricing decisions in order to exploit time variations in price and performance sensitivities, and that fund governance quality affects the degree to which investment companies engage in this opportunistic behavior.

Abstract: In the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) in 1997, some observers pronounced the demise of the developmental state. This view has recently been challenged by scholars who argue that rather than the demise of the developmental state, the role of the state has been reconfigured in the post-AFC period to meet new economic challenges and social demands. The provision of more inclusive social protection by the state is now a significant consideration. This paper will examine the role of the state in social protection in India with reference to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) which was introduced through an Act of Parliament in 2005. There are two distinguishing features of MGNREGS: it guarantees employment as a legal right, and through the provision for mandatory social audits by the beneficiaries of the scheme, it promises accountability from below. However, it is arguable whether the state has demonstrated a capacity to deliver effectively on its rights-based programme This chapter raises the central question: What does the implementation of MGNREGS reveal about the capacity of the state to provide social protection and accountability in contemporary India? The discussion cautions against viewing the state as a homogenous entity.

Abstract: This study investigates how research data contributes to non-academic impacts using a secondary analysis of high-scoring impact case studies from the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF). A content analysis was conducted to identify patterns, linking research data and impact. The most prevalent type of research data-driven impact related to "practice" (45%), which included changing how professionals operate, changing organizational culture and improving workplace productivity or outcomes. The second most common category was "government impacts", including reducing government service costs and enhancing government effectiveness or efficiency. Impacts from research data were developed most frequently through "improved institutional processes or methods" (40%) and developing impact via pre-analyzed or curated information in reports (32%), followed by "analytic software or methods" (26%). The analysis found that research data on their own rarely generate impacts. Instead they require analysis, curation, product development or other forms of significant intervention to leverage broader non-academic impacts.

Abstract: Within European Cohesion Policy, some regions manifest chronic problems with absorbing structural funds, probably due to inadequate administrative capacity. Despite the continuous assistance to improve capacity and the accumulation of learning and experience, poor performances still persist in some territories, rendering the initial explanation partial. By collecting (reports' analysis and field research), consolidating (grounded theory), and mapping (system dynamics) two Italian regions with contrasting absorption performance, this study investigates how regional authorities may be trapped in systemic decision-making structures that prioritize short-term outcomes perpetuating low absorption rates. Within a multilevel-governance context, we suggest that these decision-making traps stem from the discrepancy between European and local policy-makers' mental models; although European policies aim to promote timely absorption, sometimes they fail to acknowledge local authorities' actual agenda and may unintentionally prompt regions to overemphasize short term funds' expenditure instead of improving administrative capacity in the long term.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Offender psychology and sentencing

Abstract: This paper critically examines the inadequacies of sentencing practice in relation to a number of aspects of offender psychology. It Is argued that sentencers are inadequately informed in regard to the two major goals of sentencing: deterrence and rehabilitation. Without conducting thorough evaluations of the effectiveness of sentencing, including an analysis of the experience of offenders, it is likely that ''sentencing in the dark'' will continue. The literature on the perspectives and beliefs of offenders suggests that although offenders may plead guilty in the hope of achieving a lower sentence, in many cases there is likely to be a lack of genuine remorse and therefore the sentencing process will not effectively engage the offender. Similarly, the literature on deterrence suggests that offenders underestimate their chances of getting caught, and this is likely to diminish the intended deterrent effect of sentencing. It is argued that the current arrangement suits both sentencers and offenders as bureaucratic efficiency is served and sentences are ''discounted''. It is suggested that psychology has much to offer the criminal justice system by critically evaluating the likely impact of various sentencing strategies and pointing out conflicts in sentencing practice. The first step, it is argued, should be an attempt to disentangle the confusion of sentencing and treatment that often places both offenders and treatment staff in conflict and compromises the integrity of treatment programs.

Abstract: Using the hand-collected data of 800 Vietnamese non-financial firms from 2008 to 2018, this study constructs a comprehensive corporate governance index in alignment with the corporate governance code of best practices in Vietnam. We provide strong evidence that corporate governance quality restrains earnings management, measured by both the absolute and signed discretionary accruals and the real earnings management. In particular, the negative association between corporate governance quality and earnings management is more profound in private firms (non-SOEs), firms with high foreign ownership and low concentrated ownership, and high growth firms compared to their peers. The observed results are robust to alternative measures of discretionary accruals, total accruals andreal earnings management. Furthermore, the results are corroborated using instrumental variables, firm fixed effects and propensity score matching methods to address potential reverse causality and sample selection bias.

Abstract: Market-based instruments (MBIs) are promoted as economically efficient, targeted solutions to otherwise intractable environmental policy problems with additional potential to improve the livelihood security of ecosystem service providers. This paper argues that the effectiveness of MBIs (and the likelihood therefore of sustained environmental and social outcomes) depends on a number of often unacknowledged assumptions about the distribution of benefits arising from ecosystem service provision, the rights and duties associated with resource access, and the fitness for purpose of various policy instruments. These assumptions are illustrated and discussed using The Benefit Flows and Property Rights Matrix. It is argued that the legitimacy of MBIs depends both on the demonstrability of distinct public benefit and of acceptance among the wider community that private resource users ought to be compensated in some way for the provision of that benefit. Effective provision of ecosystem services through a market-mechanism thereafter depends on a range of additional conditions including inter-changeability of supply, scalability, lack of corroboration, adequate information, financial capacity, clarity of property rights, clarity of resource access-related duties and institutional capacity. Meeting these conditions is not simply a matter of appropriate incentive design but of political decision-making, moral judgement and social learning. Failure to recognise these conditions potentially undermines the effectiveness not only of MBIs but of alternative policy measures taken contemporaneously with MBIs such as community-based natural resource management.

Abstract: Background Two international Conventions from the International Labor Organization (ILO; C162 Asbestos Convention) and the UN (Basel Convention) offer governments guidelines for achieving a total asbestos ban policy, but the long-term effect of these Conventions on policy implementation, and the role of government effectiveness, remains unknown. We aimed to investigate associations between government ratification of the ILO and UN international Conventions, government effectiveness, and implementation of a national total asbestos ban. Methods We obtained data for year of a national asbestos ban, year of ratification of one or both international Conventions, and World Bank government effectiveness scores for 108 countries that ever used asbestos. We did a survival analysis for countries with data in the follow-up period (March 22, 1989, to Feb 2, 2018) to assess whether ratification of the international Conventions and greater government effectiveness were associated with time of implementation of a national total asbestos ban. Findings Of 108 countries with data for asbestos consumption, nine were excluded because they implemented an asbestos ban before 1989. Therefore, 99 countries were included in the survival analysis. 26 countries ratified both international Conventions and 73 ratified either one or no Convention. Countries that ratified both Conventions had a shorter time to adoption of a total asbestos ban (mean 8.9 [SD 6.4] years) than did countries that ratified one or no Conventions (16.9 [6.1] years). After controlling for government effectiveness, countries that ratified both Conventions had a significantly higher conditional probability of banning asbestos than did those ratifying one or no Convention (hazard ratio [HR] 41.8, 95% CI 4.5-383.3; p=0.0010). For every 1 point increment in government effectiveness, the percentage change in HR for persistent asbestos consumption significantly increased by 127% (95% CI 13-354; p=0.021). Interpretation This study confirms that adoption of both the C162 Asbestos Convention and the Basel Convention facilitates countries in moving towards a total asbestos ban. The effect was reinforced by government effectiveness. Both international programmes and new agreements towards total asbestos bans and government commitments are needed.

Abstract: A fragmented and segmented social protection system can create barriers for labour migration and be socially divisive. A review of the literature on Europe's integration of its social insurance system demonstrates the preconditions for developing an integrated social insurance system. These include political determination, social agreement by the contributors, administrative capacity and financial management ability. In this article, the author explains that there has been an ongoing process of gradual unification of the social insurance system in China. However, this ongoing process has not been able to achieve a universal system for both the rural and urban populations. A recent push towards further unification has been problematic. Not only have difficulties arisen from an unwillingness to implement policies, as often discussed by critics; they are also embedded in a more profound fragmentation of ideas and interests, and in institutional constraints. The author argues that a new, non-contributory basic pension, together with lowered transaction costs between contributory subsystems, may be a more realistic way forwards.

Abstract: Given the increasing importance of constitutional modification in Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Africa, Europe, and Australia, it is imperative to study systemically the conditions under which formal constitutional amendments are likely to fail. In this paper, the authors isolate conditions whereby the instrumental objectives of participants in the politics of constitutional modification threaten to overload the institutional capacity of the amending process. The proximate cause of amendment process overload is indeterminacy regarding the redistributive impact of the proposed change. Redistributive indeterminacy is a function of a rigid amending process, an institutional structure that encourages a large number of constitutional players and amendments which provide broad scope for judicial interpretation. The authors isolate two critical factors: the intensity of mass and elite preferences surrounding constitutional proposals and the structure of the amending process itself. They next trace these factors back to institutional variables to create a model to explain and predict constitutional failure in a range of contexts. Finally, they apply the model to highly visible recent constitutional failures in the United States and Canada.

Abstract: One of the most important developments in the modern global economy is financial globalization. This has raised threats to the stability of political regimes in two ways: (1) by enhancing the possibility of a financial crisis that could cause political turmoil; and (2) by easing access to foreign sources of financing for opposition political groups. I argue that state capitalism - defined as state-owned publicly listed corporations - is greater among one-party regimes as a way to address these dual threats. One-party regimes have both the motivation and a greater institutional capacity for addressing these threats in comparison to other regimes. Tests are conducted on 607 firms in 1996 and 856 firms in 2008 across seven East Asian economies, and are supplemented with case studies of Malaysia and South Korea. The evidence suggests that financial globalization is contributing to the rise of the state as a counter reaction.

Abstract: The legal framework for mine closure and rehabilitation of new and former mine sites in South Africa, including legacy abandoned sites, is comprehensive. This paper discusses legislative provisions for mine site rehabilitation and closure in South Africa with reference to established international expectations. Overall, while the South African legislative framework for mine closure and rehabilitation generally conforms with international expectations for best practice, the system is extremely complex and unwieldy. Many individual laws, regulations, and guidelines and their corresponding ministries applicable to mine closure planning and management in South Africa has created a complicated interconnected raft of provisions and expectations. It is an open question whether the most recent amendments (December 2014), have untangled or rather added to the complexities. This historical complexity along with identified governance capacity constraints (financial, technical and experience based) likely explains why implementation of the legislative framework has fallen short of mine closure expectations and mandates. As South Africa is a jurisdiction on the African continent with much experience in mining, there are many lessons that are applicable to emerging countries in the region who wish to attract the benefits of the extractives industries and minimize their potential negative consequences.

Using a natural experiment, we find that corporate giving is positively (negatively) associated with CEO charity preferences (CEO shareholdings and corporate governance quality). Evidence from CEO-affiliated charity donations, market reactions to insider-affiliated donations, its relation to CEO compensation, and firm contributions to director-affiliated charities indicates that corporate donations advance CEO interests and suggests misuses of corporate resources that reduce firm value.

Abstract: Regions of high biodiversity often coincide with regions of poverty and conservation can imply economic and social costs for poor resident populations. Environmental compensation is considered a tool to reduce socio-environmental conflict, improve the equity of conservation and promote sustainable development. The intricacies of specific socio-ecological systems may determine how compensation payments are interpreted locally to produce outcomes. This research examines the social perceptions of an ecological fiscal transfer which intends to compensate the local public administration for the substantial costs of conservation in a hotspot of biological and social diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. In this context we explore whether financial compensation (1) influences local perceptions of the conservation regime, (2) contributes towards the reconciliation of human-conservation conflicts and (3) triggers any meaningful socio-economic improvement that would counter the local costs of conservation. Results show that environmental compensation is not widely recognised as effectively benefiting the community. Local authorities consider compensation insufficient to enact a sustainable development agenda. Environmental compensation could play an important role in a policy mix for socially equitable conservation by being explicitly linked to community benefits, especially to fostering local livelihoods. The collaboration of actors operating across multiple governance levels may improve the institutional capacity of local actors to produce effective outcomes.

Abstract: This article explores the application of complexity theory to UN peacekeeping. To date, peacekeeping has been dominated by linear models of change, assuming that conflict settings can be addressed by elite-driven peace processes, gradual improvements to state institutional capacity, and development programming. However, this article argues that complexity theory offers a far more accurate and useful lens through which to view the work of peacekeeping: conflict settings represent complex, interdependent socio-political systems with emergent qualities giving them the capacity to self-organize via feedback loops and other adaptive activity. Self-organization means such systems are highly resistant to attempts to change behaviour via top-down or input-output approaches. In fact, peacekeeping itself is endogenous to the systems it is trying to change, often displaying the same kinds of self-organization typical of complex systems elsewhere. Drawing on experience working and conducting fieldwork in the UN peacekeping mission in Democratic Republic of the Congo, this article argues that UN peacekeeping operations should view themselves as actors within the complex conflict ecosystem, looking to enable transformational change from within, rather than impose liberal Western models from without.

Abstract: This study offers new insights into the largest threats to natural and mixed World Heritage sites in developed countries as considered by their management. In addition to this, the capacity of the management to deal with threats is examined. An Ordered Probit model is used that distinguishes three groups of threats and four categories of adaptive capacity of the management. Data originate from the 2014 UNESCO Periodic Report II for sites in economically advanced countries (Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea) linked to the World Heritage Site database. Estimation results reveal that the probability of a major threat to World Heritage sites is perceived to be highest in the category of climate change and extreme weather events, followed by local conditions affecting the physical structure (temperature, rain, dust). Sites in tropical climates are perceived as significantly more threatened, as are those earlier listed as in danger. The likelihood of perceiving a major threat is highest in Turkey, Italy, Norway and North America. Threats related to climate change are those the management has the lowest capacity to deal with when other important aspects are controlled for. Large and natural areas have a higher perceived administrative capacity to deal with threats than others.

Abstract: This paper explores the changing nature of North/South relations in contemporary climate change governance. Focusing on the United Nations Collaborative Programme to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the paper presents a theoretical framework, through which stakeholder perceptions of REDD+ governance quality and institutional legitimacy can be evaluated. This is tested by means of a small-n survey of state and non-state participants from both the developed and developing countries, including the Asia-Pacific region. The survey results reveal generally higher ratings for REDD+ amongst Southern participants than in the North. A number of caveats are placed on the interpretation of data, and some conclusions drawn regarding contemporary climate governance and the emergence of a possible 'South/North Divide', challenging traditional notions of global power politics.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of key elements contributing towards current and future prospects for governance in two MPAs in the Pacific Region of Guatemala. The paper follows the Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) empirical framework through the use of economic, interpretative, knowledge, legal and participative incentives that assess the effectiveness of governance. The first MPA is the Multiple Use Area of Monterrico that is governed through a co-management approach by the Centre of Conservation Studies of the University of San Carlos de Guatemala (CECON-USAC), whilst the second is Guatemala's only privately-owned marine protected area, La Chorrera-Manchon Guamuchal Reserve. The results highlight that the differences in the way they are governed have significantly shaped the effectiveness of governance. In the case of Monterrico, the limited state capacity and cross-jurisdictional coordination among stakeholders has resulted in weak economic and legal incentives, where efforts have failed to develop the necessary participatory approach to management. As a result, environmental degradation and increasing urban development is apparent, which have proven difficult to manage by the park management authority. Conversely, La Chorrera-Manch on Guamuchal has developed a governance approach based on local community involvement, which has proven successful for conservation and management initiatives for the reserve. Management is characterized by strong leadership, which has proven to be the underlying difference in both MPAs. However, the fate of the reserve is uncertain, as there is no long-term planning for success. Future prospects for effective governance are recommended, where efforts should primarily foster state involvement and political will.

Abstract: This article explores the child protection actors, processes and child maltreatment issues in a regional Local Government Unit in the Philippines. Utilising a qualitative case study design, it engages with 14 young people with histories of child maltreatment and 13 key child protection actors, exploring their views and experiences of child protection actions, processes and outcomes. The findings highlight informal community-based actors, including neighbours, family, friends and non-government organisations in initial responses to child maltreatment, compared to formal child protection actors, who respond to severe maltreatment utilising a legal framework. Actors are constrained by limited government capacity and community reach, revealing misalignment between formal child protection activities and breadth of risks for children. Non-government organisations assist child protection efforts through the provision of residential care. Policy recommendations include strengthening relationships between formal actors and communities, expanding early intervention activities, and developing the capacity of community-based child protection actors.

Abstract: BackgroundOne Health approach advocates realizing the best health and harmonious symbiosis of human, animal and natural environment through cross-border, multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation. The good governance model is the leading factor for the performance of One Health governance. In order to tackle the complex problems in the One Health governance at the global level, the variation of One Health governance in different countries was analyzed by a set of indicators within the One Health system.MethodThe capacity of One Health governance was assessed after establishment of a set of indicators for the One Health governance index (OHGI) following the methodology of the global One Health index. The data to calculate OHGI was collected from various database sources, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and official health-related institutions of various countries. Eight indicators (including 19 sub-indicators) were employed in the OHGI system to comprehensively evaluate the capacity of One Health governance in 146 countries of the world.ResultsAmong the 146 countries scored in the OHGI system, the average score was 34.11, with a median score of 31.49, ranged from 8.50 to 70.28. Most countries with higher OHGI scores come from Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific and North America, while countries with the lower OHGI scores are almost from sub-Saharan Africa. Six countries scored more than 65 points, including Australia, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, the United States of America and Finland, indicating that these countries are relatively mature in most aspects of One Health governance. However, there were some developing countries with OHGI scored lower than 15. Therefore, the gap between countries with higher OHGI scores and those with lower OHGI scores is more than 60.ConclusionsGood governance on One Health is an important indicator to measure One Health's governance capacity. The political stability, the level of rule of law and economic conditions in different regions are significantly correlated with the One Health governance capacity. Actions need to be taken urgently to close the gap of One Health governance between different regions.

Abstract: Tropical protected areas have variable success in protecting their biodiversity. Many are experiencing biodiversity declines because of pressures such as logging, fire and hunting in their immediate surroundings, and inadequate protection inside the reserves. Here we assess how the national socio-economic context in which protected areas are embedded correlates with temporal trends in the condition of their biodiversity. Focussing on 60 protected areas arrayed across the world's major tropical regions, we examine the correlation between the biodiversity 'health' of protected areas and indices of human population size, wealth, governance quality, the environmental ranking of their respective nation, and national emphasis on reserve protection. We hypothesize that, after controlling for variability in socio-economic context, a country's emphasis on implementing high-protection reserves reduces the likelihood of biodiversity decline in its protected areas. We find that, after accounting for spatial non-independence and general socio-economic context, the best predictor of biodiversity trends within a tropical protected area is the country's overall emphasis on reserve quality, as measured by the proportion of IUCN Category I-IV reserves in nations' protected-area networks. This result suggests that national-level policies can have an important influence on the fate of biodiversity in tropical protected areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Climate change and water security have become the most challenging global issues of this era, especially for developing countries like Pakistan. Amid many hindrances, poor governance has been identified as one of the most pressing reasons for ineffective action to tackle multifaceted and integrative climate-water issues in Pakistan. This article, therefore, applied a systematic literature review methodology to examine the current climate-water governance archetype, including key areas, major elements, critical gaps, and potential strategy in Pakistan. This study found that key climate-water governance areas in Pakistan are: river basin and watershed management, agriculture and irrigation management, urban and domestic water issues, floods, droughts and disaster management, groundwater management, and transboundary management. Moreover, it is revealed that the major governance elements are political commitment and leadership, policy formulation and regulation, institutional capacity and coordination, stakeholder engagement, and resource management, technology, and infrastructure development. The article also discusses how Pakistan has not effectively employed most of the identified governance elements to tackle its climate-water problems, lacking mostly in political, policy, institutional, coordination, and infrastructure aspects. In conclusion, a four-dimensional governance strategy, encompassing leadership, policy, institutions, and stakeholders is proposed to improve water sector resilience and adaptation to combat climate change in Pakistan.

Abstract: Economic instruments for conservation are invoked as a strategy to achieve the dual goals of maintaining healthy ecosystems and improving human well-being. The outcomes of such instruments are highly variable and there has been limited analysis of their social outcomes. Economic instruments for conservation can create opportunity and political leverage for minority groups or reinforce pre-existing power relationships and reproduce socio-economic inequalities. This research examines the equity implications of a government scheme from Brazil known as an ecological fiscal transfer, looking at how institutional arrangements and local power dynamics influence the application of revenue to achieve social outcomes. A case study from the Atlantic forest explores whether the application of revenue reflects the interests of a broad community base and avoids elite capture, or if decision-making processes are engineered by local power actors to further specific interests. Results demonstrate how poor local institutional capacity limits the effective governance of the revenue, leading to limited positive social outcomes. Furthermore, incentives offered by the mechanism stimulate conservation activity which implies high costs for the rural poor. The application of a framework of good governance guides the development of recommendations for improving the social equity of ecological fiscal transfer policies. These findings reinforce the importance of the design of EFTS applied in regions of poverty, if they are to promote socially equitable conservation.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Why did Divisions of General Practice implement some Access to Allied Psychological Services mental health initiatives and not others?

Abstract: Objective The Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) programs implemented through Divisions of General Practice (now Medicare Locals) enables general practitioners (GPs) to refer consumers with high-prevalence mental disorders for up to 12 individual and/or group sessions of evidence-based mental health care. The great strength of ATAPS is its ability to target vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations. Several initiatives have been introduced that focus on particular at-risk populations. This study aimed to determine the factors that had influenced Divisions' decisions to implement the various Tier 2 initiatives. Methods An online survey was sent to all Divisions. The survey contained mostly multiple choice questions and sought to determine which factors had influenced their decision-making. Results The most common factors influencing the decision to implement an initiative were the perception of local need and whether there was an existing service model that made it easier to add in new programs. The most commonly cited factors for not implementing were related to resources and administrative capacity. Conclusions This research provides valuable insights into the issues that primary care organisations face when implementing new programs; the lessons learnt here could be useful when considering the implementation of other new primary care programs. What is known about the topic? Previous evaluations of ATAPS have shed light on some of the factors that act as barriers to the implementation of new mental health initiatives by Divisions operating in primary care, but there is nothing known about why Divisions choose to implement some programs over others. Previous research suggests that barriers' to change, as reported by organisations, may be constructions that are used to make sense of a situation and that the real impediment to change are intra-organisational factors such as the self-identity of organisations. What does this paper add? This paper reports on a survey that was undertaken with Divisions regarding the reasons they chose to implement particular mental health initiatives. The paper provides insight into the barriers that Divisions perceived when implementing new mental health programs. They were primarily cited as funding and resource barriers. The findings also provide further indirect evidence of the role of the self-identity of organisations in change. What are the implications for practitioners? The study has some implications for government policy development both locally and internationally. For instance, it is likely that primary care organisations such as Divisions, especially smaller ones, require support in terms of increased funding and resources if new mental health initiatives are to be successful. Mandating the delivering of initiatives also contributes to their successful uptake. It is likely that as primary care organisations become more experienced with implementing new mental health programs, the perceived barriers will reduce and implementation will occur with more ease.

Abstract: Global and human development and freedoms increasingly thrive on robust and policy-orientated research and related activities. Yet, the African research landscape faces a myr-iad of challenges which have resulted in a very unequal continent in terms of research and research capacity. The prevailing research inequities and challenges in Africa are even more pronounced in the social sciences, humanities, arts, and related fields (SSHA). Here, the strengths and impact of scholarship in SSHA fields are often overshadowed by deficits and apparent preferential investment in research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related fields. In response, the African Academy of Sciences commissioned a study in 2020 to generate evidence on the SSHA research support landscape in Africa. This paper summarizes findings from literature review, key informant interviews, a bibliomet-ric analysis, a survey with a sample of 670 respondents from SSHA communities in Africa, and a series of focus group discussions. We highlight key messages and make recommen-dations focussing on lessons learnt, opportunities, needs, and priorities for intervention to enhance significant SSHA research leadership capacity strengthening and, ultimately, min-imize research inequalities in Africa.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Abstract: The paper aims to identify pivotal predictors of cryptocurrency legal status in a sample of 134 countries, which includes jurisdictions where cryptocurrencies are legal as well as implicitly or explicitly banned. By applying the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for logit models and sparse group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to 26 candidate predictors, we find that higher values of voice and accountability index, capturing governance quality, increase the likelihood of free cryptocurrency circulation, whereas an enhanced access to electricity, conducive to intense cryptocurrency min-ing, produces the opposite effect. The latter may arise from the fact that regulators perceive an increased access to electricity as an early warning signal of excessive and, thus, speculative cryptocurrency activities in the future, thereby imposing preemptive regulatory restrictions. A battery of robustness checks confirm the relevance of voice and accountability index as well as access to electricity, also revealing digital adoption index, which promotes cryptocurrency legality, as their closest contender in terms of variable importance. Governments need to take into account the identified factors when shaping their regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. (c) 2020 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Security sector reform (SSR) policy has, for the better part of a decade, been viewed as instrumental to the larger international project of improving and strengthening the capacity' of post-conflict and fragile' states. The current policy approach, which represents a merging of security and development agendas in the post-Cold War era, is based on the premise that fragmented, ineffective, poorly managed and politicised state security institutions threaten political stability and undermine poverty reduction and sustainable development goals. The objective of this article is to examine aspects of what has been described as the SSR policy-practice gap' that arose in the course of implementing SSR policy in Timor-Leste by analysing the systemic basis of the gap. An analytical framework that untangles the relationship between SSR policy objectives, targets and outcomes is presented in concert with a discussion of the social and political circumstances that confronted international organisations and donor countries when they sought to implement SSR policy in Timor-Leste. By using the analytical framework to assess the policy coherence between SSR objectives and the SSR programme contained in UN Security Council Resolution 1704, the ubiquitous disconnect between SSR Gospel and Reality' is pulled more sharply into focus.

Abstract: The financial crisis that erupted in East Asia in mid-1997 has renewed the long-standing debate concerning the relationship between financial liberalization and financial crises, effectively dividing this debate into two opposing camps. On one side stand those who view the crisis as the result of insufficient financial liberalization and the legacies of an economic model in which the state plays an active role in the allocation of economic resources to strategically designated ends. On the other side stand those who identify excessive financial liberalization and increased exposure to volatile capital flows as the primary cause of the crisis. This paper argues that the question around which the current debate centres - of whether too little or too much financial liberalization was to blame for the crisis - is particularly unfruitful, as it overlooks the fact that there is move than one path to liberalization. A more fruitful question to pose is what kind of liberalization can deliver the benefits of access to the opportunities of the 'global' marketplace whilst still maintaining the domestic foundations for economic growth and stability? The paper seeks to sited some preliminary light on this question through a comparative analysis of financial liberalization in Korea and Taiwan, and the way in which variations in their approaches determined their relative resiliency during the recent turmoil.

Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which Malaysia's most recent public service reform has improved service delivery and governmental performance. It also endeavors to identify critical success factors that explain reform performance and draw lessons based on the Malaysian experience. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a case study approach and draws on data from both primary and secondary sources. Besides a thorough review of official documents and existing literature, the author conducted 20 individual interviews with key informants representing government officials, academics and civil society organizations. Findings - The study shows that despite some pitfalls and misgivings, the Government Transformation Program (GTP) has produced concrete improvements in service delivery areas where previous reforms failed. One of the factors that underpin GTP's relative success is the detailed performance management framework, which helped foster inter-agency collaboration and enforce accountability for results at various levels. Practical implications - The GTP success highlights the significance of adapting reform content to local situations especially when reforms are based on external models; sanctions from the highest political office; a dedicated unit to drive the implementation and an effective performance management framework through which individuals and agencies would be held to account for results achieved. Originality/value - Despite many and varied reform initiatives attempted in the past, cases of successful reform are rare, especially in developing countries. Little is known on what makes a reform work, a gap exacerbated by notable absence of systematic research on this topic. The paper contributes to address this by reviewing Malaysia's innovative approach to reform and the insights that the Malaysian experience offers.

Abstract: Background Evidence has revealed that nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were effective in attenuating the spread of COVID-19. However, policymakers have encountered difficulty in identifying the most effective policies under different circumstances. This study investigated the relative effectiveness of different NPIs and vaccination in prolonging COVID-19 case doubling time (DT). Methods The study sample consisted of observations from 137 countries during 1 January 2020 to 13 June 2021. DT was calculated on a daily basis per country. Data were retrieved from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, World Development Indicators, and Worldwide Governance Indicators. To capture policy intervention dynamics, we combined a random-effect growth-curve model with non-standard interrupted time series analysis. We also evaluated the association of policy measures with DT for different outbreak stages and levels of government effectiveness. Results: Vaccine rollouts, workplace closures, and school closures were relatively effective. For each day that these measures were implemented, the DT increased by 1.96% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.63 to 3.29; P = 0.004), 1.41% (95% CI = 0.88 to 1.95%; P < 0.001) and 1.38% (95% CI = 0.95 to 1.81%; P < 0.001), respectively. Workplace and school closures were positively associated with DT at all stages; however, the associations weakened in later stages, where vaccine rollouts appeared to be most effective in prolonging DT (95% CI = 1.51% to 3.04%; P < 0.05). For countries with a high level of government effectiveness, most of the containment measures evaluated were effective; vaccine rollouts had the greatest effect size. For countries with medium or low levels of government effectiveness, only the closure of workplaces was consistently associated with prolonged DT. Conclusions The effectiveness of vaccine rollouts outweighed that of NPIs, especially in the later outbreak stages. However, vaccination was not associated with prolonged case DT in countries with lower levels of government effectiveness, probably due to low vaccine coverage. Among the NPIs examined, workplace closures were highly effective across all outbreak stages and levels of government effectiveness. Our findings suggest that mass vaccination is critical to reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially in countries where NPIs are less effective.

Abstract: Research on the social licence to operate (SLO) has traditionally focused on local communities directly affected by mining operations. There has been a lack of systematic research exploring attitudes to mining among the public at large. Based on a national survey (N = 1091) of Finns' attitudes towards mining conducted in 2016, we test a theoretical model using path analysis to examine the factors affecting the social licence to operate (SLO) of mining in Finland. The aim is to shed light on the factors affecting SLO at national level in Finland and to add to the growing body of research seeking to understand the mining industry's SLO at national level in diverse social, economic and political settings. The results show that among the Finnish public the factors having the greatest influence on the mining SLO (directly or indirectly) are balance of benefits over impacts, governance capacity, procedural fairness, distributive fairness, resource nationalism and trust in the mining industry. Our findings support the crucial role of trust for SLO, but additionally highlight the importance of balance over benefits. The results suggest that building trust and SLO requires more than just the actions of either the industry or governments alone - a social licence requires joint efforts.

Abstract: There is a considerable evidence showing that many states in the Global South are very weak, and therefore struggle to carry out basic responsibilities of statehood. While a handful of studies have examined problems associated with state weakness, there is a paucity of scholarly literature that thoroughly explores its empirical implications on regional security. It is on this note that this article draws on the contemporary developments in the Lake Chad region to elucidate the nodes that connect state weakness and regional security instability. It argues that any state that cannot efficaciously control its borders, promptly respond to security emergencies and demonstrate substantial institutional capacity in addressing citizens' needs is vulnerable to create regional insecurity, especially when the neighbouring states share similar attributes. The article concludes that an alternative approach to ensuring lasting regional security in such regions, especially in the present Lake Chad region, is deliberate commitment to state-building.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI), institutional quality and human development) in host countries from 2002 to 2019, using the Human Development Index [HDI] as the measure of human development. This study utilized a panel dataset of 143 countries, including both developed and developing economies, over a 17-year period. Additionally, the study employed a GMM (generalized method of moments) estimator to address unobservable heterogeneity and simultaneity. This study reveals a significant positive relationship between FDI and human development, with a stronger effect observed in developing countries compared to in developed countries. Notably, the impact of FDI-HDI nexus is larger in countries with moderately high-quality institutions, irrespective of their income level. Furthermore, good governance plays a crucial role in enhancing human development, as developing economies with high governance quality experience a greater impact of FDI on HDI compared to other countries. The findings of this study suggest that attracting FDI can be beneficial for enhancing the HDI, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the study highlights governance as a moderating factor in the relationship between FDI and HDI. Improving governance quality can enhance the positive impact of FDI on human development in host countries, especially in developing countries.

Abstract: Objective We sought to test hypotheses regarding the principal correlates of child-health performance among African nations based on previous evidence collected at finer spatial scales. Design Retrospective, cross-sectional study. Setting All countries in Africa, excluding small-island nations. Primary and secondary outcome measures We defined a composite child-health indicator for each country comprising the incidence of stunting, deaths from respiratory disease, deaths from diarrhoeal disease, deaths from other infectious disease and deaths from injuries for children aged under 5 years. We also compiled national-level data for Africa to test the effects of country-level water quality, air pollution, food supply, breast feeding, environmental performance, per capita wealth, healthcare investment, population density and governance quality on the child-health indicator. Results Across nations, child health was lowest when water quality, improved sanitation, air quality and environmental performance were lowest. There was also an important decline in child health as household size (a proxy for population density) increased. The remaining variables had only weak effects, but in the directions we hypothesised. Conclusions These results emphasise the importance of continued investment in clean water and sanitation services, measures to improve air quality and efforts to restrict further environmental degradation, to promote the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3 target to '... end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5' and Goal 6 to '... ensure access to water and sanitation for all' by 2030.

Abstract: There is a growing need to develop and implement new forms of governance that respond to the increasing complexity of decision making and balance the roles of government and local citizens. Localism is (re)emerging as an alternative to traditional top-down' governance strategies which are criticised for their failure to adequately respond to the diversity of community needs. This article uses two case studies to explore how localism works in practice, the Tasmanian Drought Support Network and the Tasmanian Forest Agreement. Four dimensions of adaptive governance are used to critically identify the benefits and limitations of localism as a governance approach, exploring the approaches capacity for social and economic entrepreneurship, governance quality and the utilisation and enhancement of individual capacities. These empirical findings will help policy makers and community members better understand localism and guide the development of theory around localism and its future practice.

Abstract: We study the impact of internal corporate governance on performance during the current financial crisis for a comprehensive cross-country sample of 4046 publicly traded non-financial firms from the U.S. and 22 developed countries. Using a broad-based index of corporate governance quality, we find that well governed firms do not outperform poorly governed firms. We explore three potential explanations for the lack of significant impact of corporate governance quality on performance. First, we examine whether cross-country differences in institutional development have an impact on the effect of corporate governance on performance. Second, we investigate whether a narrowing down of the informationally efficient segment of the stock markets during the crisis can explain the results. We do not find support for either of these conjectures. Finally, we examine whether stock markets generally became less efficient in incorporating firm-specific information into stock prices during the crisis. Our empirical evidence is consistent with the latter view that during the crisis stock markets in developed countries became less efficient in incorporating firm-specific information into prices.

Abstract: Indicator-based frameworks for assessing the sustainability of commercial fisheries have become well-established in the consumer sector. Within fisheries management, there are only a few jurisdictions, notably Australia, where sustainability frameworks are regularly used across the full spectrum of management functions, including planning, decision making, and evaluation. In Canada, a "sustainable fisheries framework" has been proposed but implementation has been limited to date. The Canadian Fisheries Research Network (CFRN), a six-year collaboration between Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the commercial fishing industry, and academic institutions, included as one of its major outputs the development of a comprehensive framework-based approach to evaluate the sustainability of commercial fisheries in Canada. Although most fisheries sustainability frameworks focus on the ecological domain, the CFRN explicitly recognized the social, economic, and institutional domains as having equal importance in a holistic treatment of sustainability. Following an iterative research and development process, a subgroup within the CFRN produced a novel sustainability indicator framework that combines a hierarchical subject matter structure consisting of domains, dimensions, and elements with a formula approach to developing indicators that utilizes a system of variables, or attributes. These two aspects of the sustainability indicator framework are linked in a way that helps to enforce comprehensive and routine methods for identifying objectives and relating those to specific indicators. The careful balancing of scope and depth makes for a powerful tool that can be used across a range of fisheries management contexts within Canada and in other jurisdictions that have a similar governance structure and high degree of institutional capacity. We present a detailed account of how the sustainability indicator framework was developed, the logic of its construction, and its potential application in fisheries management.

While co-production is intuitively attractive in its appeal to community collectivism and provision of locally appropriate services, there is a lack of reflection on the actual capacity of rural communities to become co-producers. This study considers co-production as a form of participation requiring attributes of volunteering and social involvement. It applies a model of formal participation with 5 levels from attendance at community events to organising new services, in order to assess the potential for service co-production by rural older people in 6 Scottish settlements. We find that rural older people are already heavily participating in community activities but with lower numbers taking part in the activities that require higher levels of commitment. It is the most well 'resourced' in terms of personal characteristics such as education that are most likely to participate. There are few older people who are willing to help their community that are not already involved in formal participation. Overall, findings suggest there is a very small potential pool of non-involved rural older residents who are willing to participate at high levels of commitment (co-production). Further research is now needed to build on these findings, and particularly to explore what it is that will encourage those already involved at some level to step up to co-production.

Abstract: The ability of urban centres in developing countries to rapidly transition to sustainable practises will be critical for human health and environmental sustainability as the world progresses into the twenty-first century. Sustain ability transitions in the urban water sector in developing countries have received limited scholarly attention, with very few studies demonstrating methodologies offering potential for promoting and enabling "leapfrog" transitions. This paper presents an adapted transition management process which demonstrates the importance of establishing a future vision and strategic agenda for promoting a leapfrogging trajectory. Utilising the case study of the urban water sector in Port Vila, Vanuatu, empirical evidence draws from transition management workshops, supported by in-depth interviews and mediated participation. Results suggest that the desire in Vanuatu is for the development of a sustainable urban water future, and that there is untapped latent energy which can be better utilised to assist in guiding the direction of change and promoting sustainable alternatives. The paper concludes by providing critical insights into enabling leapfrogging in other developing contexts highlighting the importance of targeted institutional capacity development, the role of purchaser provider relationships between governments and international development banks, and the potential for visions to stimulate leapfrogging trajectories.

Abstract: Tropical countries are important to conservation because of the threats to the high levels of biodiversity there, but research on conservation science in these mostly developing countries has traditionally been written by foreigners. This disconnect could have serious implications for the practice of conservation, as local scientists can be more effective than foreigners in interacting with practitioners or pushing forward conservation action themselves. These scientists' careers are strengthened by participation in the international literature, and their knowledge about conservation's success in their country provides necessary feedback to the theoretical literature. We assess the past and current status of geographic diversity in the international conservation literature, over 30 years and in comparison to other fields, as well as present acceptance rate data from prominent journals, broken down by the country of corresponding authorship. While the proportion of articles in all fields contributed by low and medium income countries increases over time, the percentage of conservation articles contributed by corresponding authors from low income countries is actually declining. Manuscripts by authors from low income countries were less than half as likely to be published as those from high income countries. We present a list of specific policies that journals can implement to reverse these trends, such as having regional editors, providing editing assistance, waiving fees, and seeking locally focused studies from which globally relevant strategies and lessons can be drawn. We also stress that long-term the problem can best be addressed by funding educational institutions that develop young researchers in the tropics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Water-management practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta have predominantly focused on structural development (e.g., dykes) to support rice-based agricultural production. Given the existing conventional approach, however, many of these efforts have been rendered ineffective . This study adopts the policy transfer concept to investigate how the participatory approach is introduced into the local institutional system, and how it shapes the construction, operation and management of the North Vam Nao scheme. Results suggest that this allowed stakeholders to engage collaboratively in these processes. The study contributes an empirical understanding of how policy transfer enhances institutional capacity for water resources management in the delta.

Abstract: In the last 30 years, environmental challenges in the Asia-Pacific have gone from sitting at the margins of political discourse to featuring prominently in academic and policy debates about institutional capacity, economic sustainability and regional futures. Those challenges are extensive: they include loss of biodiversity and species, land degradation and deforestation, water pollution and scarcity, drought, wildlife smuggling, ozone depletion, other forms of atmospheric pollution, and climate change. This article explores regional responses to environmental challenges through a global governance lens. It examines the ways in which vertical and intergovernmental arrangements have been supplemented by institutions and networks that reflect horizontal and transnational approaches. It reveals that this has been an uneven process, with coherence and fragmentation equally represented. In its focus on the two key subregions of Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia, it shows how environmental cooperation has been implicated in a crisis of regionalism and caught up in states' efforts to demonstrate that governance can still be effective in the absence of binding multilateral agreements.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The historical sociology of the state and the state of historical sociology in international relations

Abstract: With the current concern to critique neorealism, international relations (IR) theorists are looking to a variety of new perspectives as a way forward. Various authors have taken a specific interest in Weberian historical sociology (WHS), outlined in the works of Michael Mann and others. Nevertheless, there is currently only a rudimentary understanding of the approach within IR, and perhaps even less understanding of how it can be applied to LR. There is also a growing perception that the approach is inherently realist. This article seeks to redress this. It begins by laying out the basic WHS approach by identifying six general principles or traits. Special emphasis is given to recent developments in WHS's theory of state autonomy, which takes the approach beyond neorealism. Having considered how this approach overlaps with the concerns of various IR theorists, notably Linklater, Halliday and others, it proceeds to examine how the approach can take IR beyond neorealism, by applying it to understanding: international economic change through a historical examination of tariff protectionism and free trade; the international politics of states, war and revolution; and international systems change (namely European industrialization). It concludes with a possible historical sociology research agenda for the study of IR.

Abstract: "Political will" is oft-cited as the major obstacle to government's anti-corruption efforts. Notwithstanding, there is remarkably little systematic analysis of the concept, with some scholars describing it as the slipperiest concept in the policy lexicon, whereas others are calling for its empirical relevance. This paper tries to unpack the black box of political will by making it an empirically relevant concept drawing on evidence from two Asian countries; Singapore and Bangladesh. Four key indicators based on the works of earlier scholars are used including origin of the initiative; comprehension and extent of analysis; credible sanctions; and resource dedication and sustenance are used. The paper also uses Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, World Bank's World Governance Indicators (Control of Corruption and Government Effectiveness), and Political, Economic and Risk Consultancy's annual survey in Asia, as outcome measures. Based on the empirical evidence from the two countries, the paper shows that political will indeed has a positive influence on government's anti-corruption efforts. Although political will may not be sufficient, it is a necessary condition to fight corruption, and that the difference between the positions of Singapore and Bangladesh on various global corruption league tables may be attributed to political will.

Abstract: According to the theory of environmental governance, we try to uncover the impact of governance quality on environmental protection by employing cross-country level data for 164 countries during the period of 2002-2019 via GMM estimation. The baseline estimation indicates that better governance would benefit for the environmental protection, which is credibility when we conducted robustness tests by changing measurements of governance, environmental performance and setting new sub-samples. In addition, we also query that whether the governance's positive impact on environmental protection varies among different countries, supporting that the industrial structure, economic growth, urbanization, trade openness, digital economy as well as the characteristic of left-wing ideology would weaken the governance's positive impact on environmental protection. Similarly, while there exist extreme weather events such as earthquakes, epidemics, floods, and storms, the governance quality's positive impact on environmental performance would be lower. Finally, better quality of governance can lead to a better environmental performance by improving the energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy.

Abstract: The demand for renewable energy is growing worldwide due to environmental degradation. However, in poor countries, the use of renewable energy may be impeded by the level of poverty and income inequality. Therefore, this paper studies the income inequality impact on renewable energy demand in seven South Asian economies by using the balanced panel data from 1996 to 2018. The study employs generalized methods of moments (GMM) estimation technique followed by other econometric approaches to check the robustness of findings. The renewable energy demand function includes economic growth, carbon emissions, and government effectiveness as control variables. The study has found the adverse effects of income inequality, economic growth, and carbon emissions on renewable energy demand. Government effectiveness also drives renewable energy use. The findings are robust and reliable concerning panel data methods used in the analysis. These findings bear important policies for a sustainable environment in South Asian economies.

Abstract: Background: Workplace violence prevalence has attracted significant attention within the international nursing literature. Little attention to non-mental health settings and a lack of evaluation rigor have been identified within review literature. Objectives: To examine the effects of a workplace violence training program in relation to risk assessment and management practices, de-escalation skills, breakaway techniques, and confidence levels, within an acute hospital setting. Design: A quasi-experimental study of nurses using pretest-posttest measurements of educational objectives and confidence levels, with two week follow-up. Setting: A 440 bed metropolitan tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants: Nurses working in specialties identified as a 'high risk' for violence. Method: A pre-post-test design was used with participants attending a one day workshop. The workshop evaluation comprised the use of two validated questionnaires: the Continuing Professional Development Reaction questionnaire, and the Confidence in Coping with Patient Aggression Instrument. Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. The paired t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of changes in the clinical behaviour intention and confidence scores from pre-to post-intervention. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated to determine the extent of the significant results. Results: Seventy-eight participants completed both pre- and post-workshop evaluation questionnaires. Statistically significant increases in behaviour intention scores were found in fourteen of the fifteen constructs relating to the three broad workshop objectives, and confidence ratings, with medium to large effect sizes observed in some constructs. A significant increase in overall confidence in coping with patient aggression was also found post-test with large effect size. Conclusions: Positive results were observed from the workplace violence training. Training needs to be complimented by a multi-faceted organisational approach which includes governance, quality and review processes.

Abstract: Background: The Rwanda Human Resources for Health Program (HRH Program) is a 7-year (2012-2019) health professional training initiative led by the Government of Rwanda with the goals of training a large, diverse, and competent health workforce and strengthening the capacity of academic institutions in Rwanda. Methods: The data for this organizational case study was collected through official reports from the Rwanda Ministry of Health (MoH) and 22 participating US academic institutions, databases from the MoH and the College of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS) in Rwanda, and surveys completed by the co-authors. Results: In the first 5 years of the HRH Program, a consortium of US academic institutions has deployed an average of 99 visiting faculty per year to support 22 training programs, which are on track to graduate almost 4600 students by 2019. The HRH Program has also built capacity within the CMHS by promoting the recruitment of Rwandan faculty and the establishment of additional partnerships and collaborations with the US academic institutions. Conclusion: The milestones achieved by the HRH Program have been substantial although some challenges persist. These challenges include adequately supporting the visiting faculty; pairing them with Rwandan faculty (twinning); ensuring strong communication and coordination among stakeholders; addressing mismatches in priorities between donors and implementers; the execution of a sustainability strategy; and the decision by one of the donors not to renew funding beyond March 2017. Over the next 2 academic years, it is critical for the sustainability of the 22 training programs supported by the HRH Program that the health-related Schools at the CMHS significantly scale up recruitment of new Rwandan faculty. The HRH Program can serve as a model for other training initiatives implemented in countries affected by a severe shortage of health professionals.

Abstract: Fisheries governance systems designed to regulate fishing are often described as being highly diverse across countries. However, there is little systematic work that directly examines and describes the (dis)similarities across such systems, and how socio-political and economic contexts drive such variation at a global scale. In this paper, we use 68 indicators from a novel dataset to examine the fisheries governance systems in place to constrain overfishing in national waters across 142 countries. We found that countries cluster in just two distinct governance groups which display different traits to constrain overfishing. Where one group takes a tougher stance on aspects regarding access to its fisheries resources, the other is more focused on gathering fisheries information and publicizing the data. The 10 greatest differences between groups relate to the gathering of information and monitoring of their fisheries, the effectiveness of compliance systems and the existence of policies around sustainability. On these key differences, one group consistently displays more far-reaching governance traits. The overall governance capacity of a country and the national socio-economic importance of fisheries are identified as potential drivers of this variation. Despite their differences, the two groups show substantial overlap for many indicators, particularly those that are inexpensive, but also for certain costly policies. These patterns prompt hypotheses of policy transfer or convergence across fisheries governance systems, most notably regarding 'low-hanging fruit' policies.

Abstract: Assessment of the quality of governance has so far relied on socioeconomic statistics and expert opinions, while largely neglecting citizens' perceptions. Using Asia Barometer 2008 data, this paper examines the factors affecting citizens' satisfaction with their government in six Asian-Pacific countries: America, Australia, China, India, Japan, and Russia. I found citizen satisfaction with the public services they receive, such as education, healthcare, and public safety, matters most in their assessment of government performance. Individual satisfaction with income, job, and housing also matters. The respondent will disapprove government performance if he or she thinks corruption is serious in government, or elected officials stop caring about citizens once voting is finished. In terms of macro variables, economic condition of a country seems to matters significantly. Especially, if a country's economy is growing fast, citizens are much more likely to be satisfied with government performance. Large within-country variations exist in countries such as China and India, where citizens of different cities or regions may give rather different assessments of government, suggesting many contextual variables not captured by this study. Lastly, citizens' satisfaction with government performance seems to be highly divergent from international organizations' evaluation of governance quality, such as the World Bank Governance Index. This raises both methodological and normative issues regarding the proper approaches to measuring good governance.

Abstract: An unprecedented number of firms announced CEO salary reductions at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. We document that the total compensation for these CEOs did not actually decrease but was instead restructured, leading to a marked increase in opaque components of compensation. These adjustments align with the managerial power view of executive pay setting, whereby heightened stakeholder outrage prompts greater camouflaging of compensation to avoid scrutiny. We further show that this pattern of compensation adjustments predominantly occurred in firms with powerful CEOs, weak institutional investor monitoring, and poorer governance quality.

Abstract: This paper examines the effect of female directors on corporate debt maturity structures. We find that firms with a higher ratio of female directors tend to have a larger proportion of short-maturity debt. This effect is more pronounced with female independent directors and is insignificant with female inside directors. These findings remain robust under propensity score matching and instrumental variable approaches to address potential endogeneity concerns. Furthermore, we find that our results are driven primarily by firms with weak governance quality and low financial constraints. We also find that the effect does not differ between high- and low-leveraged firms, and there is a negative relation between female directors and likelihood of overinvestment. This evidence suggests that female directors view short-term debt as a monitoring device.

Abstract: The natural sciences are receiving increasing attention in the Global South. This timely development may help mitigate global change and quicken an envisioned food system transformation. Yet in order to resolve complex issues such as agrochemical pollution, science ideally proceeds along suitable trajectories within appropriate institutional contexts. Here, we employ a systematic literature review to map the nature of inquiry and institutional context of pest management science in 65 low- and middle-income countries published from 2010 to 2020. Despite large inter-country variability, any given country generates an average of 5.9 publications per annum (range 0-45.9) and individual nations such as Brazil, Kenya, Benin, Vietnam, and Turkey engage extensively in regional cooperation. International development partners are prominent scientific actors in West Africa but are commonly outpaced by national institutions and foreign academia in other regions. Transnational institutions such as the CGIAR represent a 1.4-fold higher share of studies on host plant resistance but lag in public interest science disciplines such as biological control. Despite high levels of scientific abstraction, research conducted jointly with development partners shows real yet marginal improvements in incorporating the multiple (social-ecological) layers of the farming system. Added emphasis on integrative system-level approaches and agroecological or biodiversity-driven measures can extend the reach of science to unlock transformative change.

Abstract: In 2005, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mongolia initiated the process of developing its Health Sector Strategic Master Plan (HSSMP), using a wide-ranging consultative process, driven by the MoH, and requiring participation from all levels of health facilities, other ministries, donor agencies and NGOs. Among other objectives, the MoH sought to coordinate the disparate inputs from key donors through the HSSMP, aligning them with the Plan's structure. This research explores the extent to which the HSSMP process served as a mechanism for effective aid coordination while promoting ownership and capacity building and the lessons learned for the wider international development community. The study is based on document review, key-informant interviews and authors' experience and participation in the MoH planning processes. The HSSMP process improved alignment and harmonisation. It enabled a better local understanding of the benefits of aid coordination, and the recognition that aid coordination as not only a mere administrative task, but a strategic step towards comprehensive management of both domestic and external resources. The process was not challenge free; the fractious political environment, the frequent turnover of key MoH staff, the resistance of some donors towards MoH scrutiny over their programmes and the dismantling of the central coordination and return of seconded staff following completion of the HSSMP, has slowed the pace of reform. Despite the challenges, the approach resulted in positive outcomes in the areas of ownership and better aid coordination, with HSSMP development emphasising ownership and capacity building. This contrasted with the usual outcomes focus, and neglect of the capacity building learning processes and structural and policy changes needed to ensure sustainable change. The largest and most influential programmes in the health sector are now largely aligned with HSSMP strategies, enabling the MoH to utilize these opportunities to optimise the HSSMP outcomes. The lessons for Ministries of Health in similar Post-Soviet countries-or other emerging economies where government capacity and local policy processes are relatively strong-are clear: the development of solid governance and technical infrastructure in terms of planning and evaluation provide a solid structure for donor coordination and insure against local political change.

Abstract: Introduction The 2023 World Health Assembly resolution 76.18 committed the World Health Organization to the coordination of drowning prevention efforts, including those of United Nations (UN) agencies. Here, we aim to map drowning prevention linkages across UN Agency agendas, make recommendations to guide global strategies and inform the development of the Global Alliance and a Global Strategy for drowning prevention.Methods We applied a qualitative multimethod approach, including document review, key informant interviews, an interagency workshop and international conference panel discussion, to refine data and create our recommendations. We developed a framework to identify intersections between health and sustainable development agendas and applied it to map intersections and opportunities for the integration of drowning prevention across relevant UN Agency agendas.Results Our framework categorised intersections for drowning prevention in UN Agendas according to potential for (a) shared understandings of problems and solutions, (b) shared capacities, guidelines and resources and (c) shared governance and strategic pathways, noting that some factors overlap. We present our Position, Add, Reach and Reframe approach to outlining opportunities for the integration of drowning prevention in health and sustainable development agendas. Our results emphasise the importance of establishing approaches to the Global Alliance and Global Strategy that ensure high-level political advocacy is converted into solutions for affected communities. We recommend using research to inform effective action, building capacity and best practices, and promoting evaluation frameworks to incentivise and verify progress.Conclusion Our study identifies opportunities to expand drowning prevention efforts and to build Member State capacity to reduce drowning risk through evidence-informed measures that address vulnerabilities, exposures, hazards and build population-level resilience to drowning. Our framework for identifying opportunities for integration of drowning prevention across a multisectoral set of agendas offers a research and policy toolkit that may prove useful for other policy areas.

Abstract: Since the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, there has been much discussion about whether the international community has moved into a new post-Westphalian era, where states increasingly recognize certain shared norms that guide what they ought to do in responding to infectious disease outbreaks. In this article I identify this new obligation as the 'duty to report', and examine competing accounts on the degree to which states appreciate this new obligation are considered by examining state behaviour during the H5N1 human infectious outbreaks in East Asia (since 2004). The article examines reporting behaviour for H5N1 human infectious cases in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam from 2004 to 2010. The findings lend strong support to the claim that East Asian states have come to accept and comply with the duty to report infectious disease outbreaks and that the assertions of sovereignty in response to global health governance frameworks have not systematically inhibited reporting compliance.

Abstract: Global seafood sourcing networks are expanding to meet demand. To describe contemporary fishery expansion patterns, we analyzed the worldwide exploitation of sea cucumber (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) traded via Hong Kong for consumers in China. In just 15 years (1996-2011), the sea cucumber sourcing network expanded from 35 to 83 countries; sea cucumber fisheries serving the Chinese market now operate within countries cumulatively spanning over 90% of the world's tropical coastlines. The emergence of such fisheries in nations where they were previously absent could not be explained either by their national governance capacity or by their distance from Hong Kong. Surging imports from these new fisheries have compensated for declines in long-standing fisheries elsewhere. The case of commercial sea cucumber trade for the Chinese market exemplifies a new global extraction phenomenon that we call contagious resource exploitation - a fast-moving system resembling a disease epidemic, where long-distance transport expedites large-scale expansion followed by diffusive local spread into neighboring areas. Multi-level and multi-scale decision making is urgently needed to control and mitigate the effects of contagious exploitation.

Abstract: Political dynamics across scales are often overlooked in the design, implementation and evaluation of environmental governance. We provide new evidence to explain how interactions between international organizations and national governments shape environmental governance and outcomes for 238 World Heritage ecosystems, on the basis of a new intervention-response-outcome typology. We analyse interactions between the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and 102 national governments responsible for implementing ecosystem protection under the World Heritage Convention between 1972 and 2019. We combine data on the reporting, deliberation and certification of individual ecosystem-level threats, with data on national governance quality, economic complexity and key stakeholder perspectives. We find that the extent of threatened ecosystems is seriously underestimated and that efforts to formally certify threatened ecosystems are often resisted by national governments. A range of responses to international intervention, including both productive and counterproductive responses, generates material impacts at the ecosystem level. Counterproductive responses occur in nations dependent on limited high-value natural resource industries, irrespective of overall level of economic development. We identify new political approaches to improve environmental governance, including how to overcome the problem of regulatory capture. Our findings inform how we can better anticipate and account for political dynamics in environmental governance. Interaction between international organizations and national governments over 238 World Heritage ecosystems shows patterns of productive and counterproductive dynamics, which yield lessons to improve environmental governance.

Abstract: Focusing on the toughest-ever environmental policy in China, this paper investigates the causal evidence of how environmental regulations influence listed firms' capital structure dynamics. The difference-in-difference estimation findings showed that the speed of leverage adjustment of highly polluting firms significantly declined after the implementation of tightened environmental regulations, compared with that of low -polluting firms. The dynamics of this impact turned out to be significant instantly after the policy shock and persisted for at least two years. Furthermore, the negative impact of environmental regulations on the speed of leverage adjustment by highly polluting firms was much weaker for firms with better corporate governance capacity and stronger for firms with higher information asymmetry. This study also identified that the possible channel of these main findings is that the cost of the debt and equity of highly polluting firms significantly increased after the implementation of the environmental regulations. Additional findings suggested that the tightened environmental regulations mitigated the speed of leverage adjustment of highly polluting firms because they increased these firms' adjustment costs. All main empirical findings passed a variety of endogeneity tests, including propensity score matching difference-in-difference and the inclusion of province fixed effects. These findings were also consistent across a battery of robustness tests, such as an alternative indicator of highly polluting industries, an alternative estimator of the speed of leverage adjustment, the extension of the sample period, and placebo tests with falsified event dates.(c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Abstract: Governance has many dimensions - corporate governance pertains to the firm's management whilst sovereign-governance pertains to the firm's exposure to sovereign risk, corruption, and poor regulation. We show that both are important drivers of firm value and this has serious implications for the increasing number of Chinese firms choosing to cross-list in the USA. Whilst the legal bonding hypothesis argues that firms from poor-corporate governance environments can signal their quality by issuing stock in the USA it is silent on the role of sovereign-governance. Thus, we use a sample of cross-listed firms from 48 countries between 1996 and 2008 and find that the home-country's sovereign-governance quality, but not its corporate governance quality (as proxied by the Anti-director Rights Index) continue to influence the market values of cross-listed firms. Furthermore, cross-listed firms from strong-governance countries have higher market values than non-cross-listed firms or firms from weak governance countries. These results highlight the importance of distinguishing between the myriad types of governance when analysing the bonding hypothesis and the drivers of cross-listed stocks' valuations, and emphasize the continued importance of sovereign-governance for cross-listed firms.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the pervasive impacts on global fishery resources caused by stressors such as overfishing and climate change could dramatically increase the likelihood of fishery conflict. However, existing projections do not consider wider economic, social, or political trends when assessing the likelihood of, and influences on, future conflict trajectories. In this paper, we build four future fishery conflict scenarios by considering multiple fishery conflict drivers derived from an expert workshop, a longitudinal database of international fishery conflict, secondary data on conflict driver trends, and regional expert reviews. The scenarios take place between the years 2030 and 2060 in the North-East Atlantic ("scramble for the Atlantic''), the East China Sea ("the remodeled empire''), the coast of West Africa ("oceanic decolonization''), and the Arctic ("polar renaissance''). The scenarios explore the implications of ongoing trends in conflict-prone regions of the world and function as accessible, science-based communication tools that can help foster anticipatory governance capacity in the pursuit of future ocean security.

Abstract: Achieving integrated river basin management in large multi-jurisdictional river basins is a difficult task, In the Mekong River basin some of the countries have begun to implement a cooperative framework,, which indicates a desire to achieve a form of integrated management. Significant progress was been made but results still fall short of the ideal. The primary reasons for this includes the lack of institutional capacity of the multi-jurisdictional cooperative authority and its counterpart organizations in each of the participating countries, together with a lack of political drive to develop integrated management as a priority.

Abstract: Few studies have explored the influence of horizontal (i.e., among group) inequalities on terrorism, yet it seems plausible that these inequalities may be relevant. Employing data from the Global Terrorism Database and Ethnologue, this article examines the effect of ethnic economic inequality on domestic terrorism for 130 countries over the period 2001 to 2018. We present evidence that higher degrees of ethnic inequality lead to higher numbers of terrorist attacks as well as a higher number of people killed or injured. This positive association between ethnic inequality and terrorism is robust to alternative measures of ethnic inequality, omission of influential countries and regions, the inclusion and exclusion of controls, and alternative estimation strategies. In contrast, countries with high degree of political freedom and high governance quality tend to suffer less from terrorism. Promoting economic equality among ethnic groups, therefore, has the potential to reduce the risk of domestic terrorism. We propose that a critical step towards promoting this equality is to enhance social inclusion. The benefits of increasing social inclusion extend beyond simply reducing the incidence of terrorism and inter-racial violence; creating a socially inclusive society is a social justice imperative and the responsibility of policymakers, social institutions, civil society, and the private sector. It is also consistent with the notion of inclusive economic growth, as championed by organizations such as the OECD and the United Nations Development Program.

Abstract: Background: Recent complex and cross-boundary policy problems, such as climate change, pandemics, and financial crises, have recentred debates about state capacity, democratic discontent and the 'crisis of expertise'. These problems are contested and open to redefinition, misunderstanding, spin, and deception, challenging the ability of policymakers to locate, discriminate, comprehend, and respond to competing sources of knowledge and expertise. We argue that 'non-knowledge' is an under-explored aspect of responses to major policy crises.Key points: While discussed in recent work in sociology and other social sciences, non-knowledge has been given less explicit attention in policy studies, and is not fully captured by orthodox understandings of knowledge and evidence use. We outline three main forms of non-knowledge that challenge public agencies: amnesia, ignorance and misinformation. In each case, 'non-knowledge' is not simply the absence of policy-relevant knowledge. Amnesia refers to what is forgotten, reinvented or 'unlearned', while claims of ignorance involve obscuring or casting aside of relevant knowledge that could (or even should) be available. To be misinformed is to actively believe false or misleading information. In each instance, non-knowledge may have strategic value for policy actors or aid the pursuit of self-interest.Conclusions and implications: We demonstrate the relevance of non-knowledge through a brief case study, emerging from the inquiry into the COVID-19 hotel quarantine programme in the Australian state of Victoria. We argue that both amnesia and 'practical' forms of ignorance contributed to failures during the early part of the programme.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems are subject to a range of likely impacts from drivers of environmental change, including human-induced climate change that is warming sea surface temperatures, altering ocean chemistry and affecting run-off of land-based pollutants and sediments. Such transformations will challenge the adequacy of governance and management regimes for conserving marine biodiversity. Assessment of the fitness of current governance and management regimes to meet the challenges, including their adaptive capacity, can be established through an understanding of what is required for an effective response. We provide such a foundation by identifying governance and management requirements that would support the resilience of marine biodiversity and ecosystems and associated social-ecological systems. The requirements were established through an expert panel methodology in conjunction with an analysis of relevant literature. We explain the relevance of these requirements to marine biodiversity conservation in a changing climate under the following themes: systems understanding, networks and learning; values and world views; institutional forms; leadership and resources; engagement and decision making: cohesion and direction: and governance quality. Informing institutional and management design using these requirements will enable the development of regimes more suited to meeting the fundamental challenges that unanticipated, abrupt and turbulent change poses for the conservation of marine biodiversity and the resilience of associated social-ecological systems. Such a governance and management regime would be more effective in managing social-ecological resilience because it has the capacity and flexibility to deal with change, founded on learning, diversity and ethics.

Abstract: The worldwide movement toward digitisation in public service delivery presents a range of opportunities and risks. The potential benefits include improved efficiency, more consistent service delivery decisions and enhanced responsiveness to citizens' demand. The potential risks range from challenges in data use and privacy, to uneven service accessibility and the costly ICT investment required for digitisation. Researchers have begun to assess this important movement and its impacts. There remains a lack of in-depth understanding of digitisation of public service delivery in developing countries. We aim to address that gap by examining a fully online welfare-to-work programme in a developing country, that is Indonesia's Pre-employment Card Program. Using data collected from semi-structured interviews with policymakers and service providers, we found evidence that digitalisation contributed to the programme's efficiency and effectiveness via, for example, automated registration processes and quick and revisable rollout. Its implementation however was not without challenges such as a digital divide among users and some technical problems. Indonesia's experiences with this fully digital programme suggest that a developing country, despite limited financial and administrative capacity, can embark on the digitalisation journey to improve their public service provision, even during the time of crisis.

Abstract: This study examines how politician's career concerns affect the bank loans using a sample of bank branches at the county-level in China. We use politician tenure to measure an important dimension of the politician incentives to intervene in the local economy, which is determined by their career concerns about perceived promotion probability. We find that there is a curvilinear relationship between politician tenure and bank loans (i.e., reversed U-shape). We also construct a promotion pressure index and document a positive relationship between this promotion index and bank loans. These results are more significant for banks located in counties with underdeveloped institutions or weak government capacity, and those with political ties. These results support the view that politicians have strong incentives to utilize local banks to promote local economic growth if it is also consistent with their private goals, especially in the environment with significant government ownership in banking systems.

Abstract: Drawing upon recent fieldwork, we examine the paradoxical effects of the institutional transfer and capacity-building approach adopted by the ongoing regional intervention in post-conflict Solomon Islands. Taking the mission's substantial police-building component as our focus, we argue that this engagement has done little to extend the functional authority of the local police in rural Solomon Islands and has, moreover, induced unsustainable levels of dependency on external assistance. We also argue that this engagement has inadvertently reinforced lack of public confidence in the local police, thereby undermining its legitimacy. The privileging of institutional capacity building and failure to engage with community-based providers of policing and justice services in rural localities has resulted in the neglect of critical issues of legitimacy and the extension of administrative power which are integral to the larger state-building process. In considering how these shortcomings might be addressed, we explore contemporary nostalgia for older administrative systems that appeared capable of sustaining vertical linkages between central government and the rural periphery, as well as horizontal linkages between state and local legal orders. We sketch the diverse configurations of current policing and justice practices in rural areas and the strong desire for greater engagement between the different orders and providers. Through reference to a nascent community policing project, we canvas some alternative imaginings of how Solomon Islands institutions might be transformed to produce more effective and sustainable policing and justice outcomes for rural-based citizens and that can simultaneously advance the larger state-building agenda.

Using earnings management as a proxy for corporate governance outcome, we find that target firms' earnings management is aligned with that of block acquirers after acquisitions, implying that blockholders transfer their own governance quality to investee firms. We further identify three economic mechanisms that underlie the governance transfer effect, namely, monitoring effectiveness, monitoring cost, and monitoring environment.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to an emerging body of critique of communicative planning theory (CPT). The critiques in the paper are grounded in analysis of situated planning practice in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, where planners were 'feeling their way towards' democratising planning practice in line with the normative dimensions of CPT. Two critiques are offered. Both are fundamentally concerned with power and the tendency of CPT to operate as if the workings of power can be temporarily suspended through communicative planning practice to produce new consensual planning discourses. First, it is argued that CPT pays insufficient attention to the practical context of power in which planning is practised, thereby assuming away, rather than engaging with, the politics-laden and power-laden interests that infiltrate planning practice. Second, it is argued that CPT abstracts planners from their positioning in a nexus of power, knowledge, and rationality which validates expert forms of knowing/reasoning/valuing, and thus underestimates the challenges of asserting alternative forms. The paper concludes with a suggestion that any theory aiming at the democratisation of planning practice will need to depart from an orientation to consensus, a defining feature of CPT, and instead account for the irreducible nature of power and difference.

Abstract: Indigenous Australians have a growing capacity to extract monetary payments from mineral development on their traditional lands. Considerable controversy surrounds the possible use of these payments to fund services such as health, housing and education for the Indigenous groups concerned. Critics of such an approach argue that government should provide basic public services to all citizens, and that use of 'mining payments' for service provision denies Indigenous people specific compensation for the negative impacts of mining and an important opportunity to enhance their economic status. There is also a danger that government may reduce its existing spending on services, leaving Indigenous people no better off as a result of allowing mining to occur. This article argues that while there are certainly risks involved in using mining payments to fund services, Indigenous groups can generate substantial net benefits by doing so. Mining payments can leverage additional government spending; fund services at a level or of a sort that government will not provide; give Indigenous people greater control over service provision; and help develop Indigenous organisational skills and governance capacity. A strategic approach is required to minimise risk and maximise the available benefits, and the article identifies policy principles that can be applied to secure such an outcome.

Abstract: Asia-Pacific countries are experiencing rapid economic growth. Is this growth ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors-based and aligned growth? Therefore, this study investigates the connections between ESG indicators and economic growth in East Asia Pacific and South Asia. To achieve this aim, we employed the FMOLS, DOLS, and AMG models. While the AMG model highlights significant long-term positive effects of the environmental (EFs) and governance factors (GOVNF) on economic growth, the FMOLS and DOLS models emphasize the substantial influence of social factors (SOC) on economic growth. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of ESG factors and offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align strategies with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Notably, the GOVNF, with components like control of corruption, regulatory quality, rule of law, and government effectiveness, does not influence the GDP of developed nations, such as Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. However, its significance is evident in countries like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. This result might stem from the possibility that developed countries have historically addressed and resolved issues like corruption and the rule of law, while these elements remain crucial determinants for the economic growth of developing nations like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Empirical findings provide the region's policymakers with essential insights and a guide for implementing their economic growth policies ESG factor-based and aligned to the United Nations' SDGs. These targets will make the economic growth of the region's countries sustainable.

Abstract: Temporary migrant workers in Southeast Asia are subject to various abuses in recruitment, work and repatriation. A decade ago ASEAN governments committed to developing an Instrument governing migrant worker rights, but a series of deadlocks have stymied this agreement. Prevailing accounts explain this impasse as the consequence of incompatible national interests, norms of non-interference and consensus, a lack of institutional capacity and the limits of rights advocacy in ASEAN. Conversely, utilising a political economy framework, this article demonstrates this impasse in regional governance reflects societal-level conflicts among migrant workers, civil society organisations, business groups and state-based actors, generated by the latter's adoption of migrant labour as both a livelihood and development strategy.

Abstract: Sea level rise poses severe consequences for the economic stability, habitability, and existence of Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Recent legal developments have offered conflicting interpretations of the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention, but under the existing framework, Pacific SIDS are at the precipice of losing substantial territorial sovereignty and maritime entitlements. These losses have unprecedented and cascading impacts across sovereignty, governance capacity, and migration. To mitigate immediate impacts of sea level rise, strategies of physical adaptation, planned relocation, and a new rule of customary law are recommended for Pacific SIDS. Revisiting regimes crafted during periods of ecological stability will also be critical to effectively integrate climate change law with international systems. Broadly, there is an urgent need to address the growing impact of sea level rise on legal obligations under international law.

Abstract: Background: Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing is a problem for marine resource managers, leading to depletion of fish stocks and negative impacts on marine ecosystems. These problems are particularly evident in regions with weak governance. Countries responsible for sustainable natural resource management in the Southern Ocean have actively worked to reduce IUU fishing in the region over a period of 15 years, leading to a sequence of three distinct peaks of IUU fishing. Methodology/Principal Findings: We reviewed existing public records relating to IUU fishing in the Southern Ocean between 1995-2009 and related this information to the governance capacity of flag states responsible for IUU vessels. IUU operators used a number of methods to adapt to enforcement actions, resulting in reduced risks of detection, apprehension and sanctioning. They changed fishing locations, vessel names and flag states, and ports for offloading IUU catches. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of IUU vessels flagged to CCAMLR countries, and a significant decrease in the average governance index of flag states. Despite a decreasing trend of IUU fishing, further actions are hampered by the regional scope of CCAMLR and the governance capacity of responsible states. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study of long-term change in the modus operandi of IUU fishing fishing operators, illustrating that IUU operators can adapt to enforcement actions and that such dynamics may lead to new problems elsewhere, where countries have a limited capacity. This outsourcing of problems may have similarities to natural resource extraction in other sectors and in other regions. IUU fishing is the result of a number of factors, and effectively addressing this major challenge to sustainable marine resource extraction will likely require a stronger focus on governance. Highly mobile resource extractors with substantial funds are able to adapt to changing regulations by exploiting countries and regions with limited capacity.

Abstract: Local governments have a vital climate change adaptation role. However, major breakdowns in the ability of local governments to mainstream adaptation responses have been widely observed. Using a Systematic Quantitative Literature Review method, we assessed 131 original research articles published 2005-2020 to answer three key questions: What trends are evident in the global literature that explain adaptation mainstreaming efforts in municipal policy and practice? What factors are conceptualized as shaping adaptation mainstreaming in local government? Which elements can be considered key to advancing adaptation mainstreaming in municipal policy and practice?We find two overarching factors affect outcomes - authority to adapt and capacity to adapt. Authority to adapt refers to the authorizing environment - or mandate - from national or sub-national government, or from local government leaders, for adaptation action by a municipal administration. Capacity to adapt refers to access to resources, professional networks, and supportive organizational systems and culture, that enable local government adaptation. We find lack of support from local government elected leaders is the most frequently identified barrier to municipal adaptation. Yet, few empirical studies offer deep insight into the factors that inform and influence leadership support for municipal adaptation. Further, we find local government capacity to adapt is largely treated as a singular capacity, held constant throughout the policy cycle. We find limited exploration of the capacities vital to each stage of the policy cycle and the configuration of factors that support adaptation outcomes. We devise a conceptual framework explaining how issues of authority and capacity can interact and influence each other and what they encompass. Such a framework has broader utility for policy development and importantly for implementation at the local level.Key policy insightsMunicipal adaptation can be strengthened through expanded understanding of, and attention to, the factors that inform local leaders' decisions on adaptation, notably clustered around authority and capacity to adapt.Policymakers are encouraged to actively consider the differing capacities needed to progress adaptation through each stage of the policy cycle.Using an implementation lens to evaluate adaptation practice could support documentation of planning-to-implementation gaps and ways of bridging these gaps for enhanced municipal adaptation outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate whether development aid stimulates growth in transition economies, paying particular attention to the possibility of spatial spillovers arising from aid. We find that common borders and a shared historical and political heritage result in a complex set of associations between aid and growth. Aid has a positive impact on growth in the recipient country. However, the impact of aid also spills over to affect other nations. Aid appears to create positive spillovers through improved total factor productivity and possibly currency appreciation. At the same time, aid depletes human capital through emigration and it particularly adversely affects democracy and governance quality in other transition economies. On balance, aid generates net adverse growth spillovers in transition economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In a world of open-ended access to social media, the ability of governments to control information is slipping away. It is plausible in countries with limited Internet access for citizens to remain ignorant of the true amount of corruption. We built a cross-country panel of 124 developing nations to analyze the effect of Internet usage on perceptions of corruption from 1996 to 2009. We find that, ceteris paribus, the information citizens receive from the World Wide Web leads to deteriorating views of the state of corruption in their country. Greater perceptions of government effectiveness are unsurprisingly found to negatively and significantly decrease perceptions of corruption within countries.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether or not private benefits of control by managers and large shareholders influence the financing cost of firms. Evidence shows that lending banks demand a significantly higher loan spread, higher fees, shorter loan maturity, smaller loan size, stricter covenants, and greater collateral on firms with greater private benefits of control. Results are stronger for firms with weak corporate governance quality, supporting the agency cost viewpoint. Such evidence implies that banks consider higher private benefits of control as a type of agency problem when they make lending decisions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Scholars recommend country (or region) specific energy security indices capable of adequately considering local specificities in the absence of a 'universal' index. Such an index is not available for Nepal. Hence, this study is the first to develop the Energy Security Composite Index of Nepal (ESCOIN), applying a comprehensive indicator-based approach to quantify energy security (ES) of Nepal. We build upon the notion that a country is able to trade energy when it is energy secure. We quantify Nepal's energy security and qualitatively assess the prospect for regional power trade in South Asia. A long list of 77 indicators is compiled from an extensive review of international literature. Based on the context, applicability to Nepal, data availability and conditions of multicollinearity, this list of indicators is narrowed down to 21. Principal Component Analysis is then applied to evaluate the importance of the components for ESCOIN. Our results show that Nepal has consistently held a boundary position between "moderate" to "high" classes of ES in the last decade. We identify key reasons for this. First, the country's domestic sector is over-reliant on traditional fuels (dry-dung, firewood and agricultural residues). Second, Nepal faces a problem of suppressed demand in the absence of energy-intensive development activities in all productive sectors of the economy. Third, the growth in the energy demand is met only marginally by domestic hydropower and other renewables, and largely by increasing imports. Hence, we surmise a 'pseudo energy secure' state for Nepal. Although efforts are underway, electricity trade with China, Bangladesh and other South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries is economically difficult and technically challenging. Hence, cross-border electricity trading, particularly with India, can be seen as an opportunity for Nepal provided considerable infrastructural development occurs, institutional capacity is strengthened, and genuine political commitment and trust are sustained. Moreover, Nepal should focus on achieving self-sufficiency in energy through domestic hydropower and renewable sources and aim to stabilize energy consumption rather than being overly ambitious of exports, at least in the near future.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Coping with Multiple Stresses in Rural South Africa

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to investigate how local communities cope with and adapt to multiple stresses in rural semiarid South Africa. In semiarid regions water scarcity is one of a number of stresses that shape livelihood vulnerability. With climate change, it is predicted that rainfall in South Africa will become more uncertain and variable in the future, exposing more people to water insecurity. At the same time, the impacts of disease, a lack of institutional capacity, and limited livelihood opportunities can combine to limit adaptive capacity. Therefore, adaptation to changing climate should not be viewed in isolation but instead in the context of social, economic, and political conditions, all of which shape local community vulnerability and people's ability to cope with and adapt to change. This study uses a qualitative-quantitative-qualitative framework, including the use of a stated preference survey, to identify the drivers of agroecosystem change, to understand the capacity of households to cope with droughts, and to determine the ability of local institutions to respond to crises. The analysis suggests that the capacity of the agroecosystem to remain productive during droughts is decreasing, individual/household adaptive capacity remains low, and institutional capacity faces considerable barriers that prevent it from supporting households to adapt to multiple stresses. This research adds weight to the claim that vulnerability reflects multiple forces and processes, and that multiple stresses, that are agroecological, socioeconomic, and institutional in nature, need to be examined to understand vulnerability and to prevent maladaptation.

Abstract: We examine whether outside investors mimic insider trades by analyzing the daily transactions of foreign institutional investors (FII) in the Indian emerging market. We find that the value relevance of insiders' opportunistic buy trades is much higher in our context relative to that reported for developed markets. More importantly, we find that FII mimic opportunistic buy trades, which is more pronounced for firms that are informationally more opaque or have lower corporate governance quality. A long-short strategy based on FII's transactions after opportunistic trades generates an additional abnormal return of approximately 29% annually, compared to transactions based on routines trades.

Abstract: The premise of this article is that when comparing governance systems, a greater focus on the complexity of the environment facing nation states would provide a step forward. National regimes should not be compared in a vacuum but rather with respect to the governance challenges they are likely to face in an unpredictable world. It is necessary to recognize the adaptive complexity of the systems generating those challenges and yet how they also providing the ingredients for emergent solutions. It is argued that exploring interactive capacity rather than formal structures will provide a stronger indication of whether governance challenges are likely to be met. It is concluded that different types of national regimes could, in principle, deliver effective interactive governance capacity in different ways, but each can generate tipping points that could lead to failure.

Abstract: The Asia-Pacific region is recognised as an epicentre of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), of which 75% are zoonotic in nature. Vietnam is recognised as a potential hotspot for zoonotic EIDs. There is a growing recognition that progress towards global health security requires greater focus on collaboration between the human health and animal health sectors to control diseases at their animal source and prevent against human health impacts. Assessment of veterinary epidemiology capacity in Vietnam is paramount to strengthening the health security of Asia-Pacific. This study aims to evaluate the national capacity and needs of veterinary services in Vietnam in biosecurity, biosafety and One Health. A cross-sectional, convergent mixed-methods study was conducted between November 2020 and April 2021. An online questionnaire was administered to government-employed field veterinarians. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were performed using survey responses to understand capacity in the field. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with stakeholders in veterinary services including government, academia, research institutes, non-profit and international organisations. Coding and thematic analysis using a deductive approach was used for data collected from interviews to contextualise findings from the survey and understand institutional capacity. In total, 178 field veterinarians completed the online survey and 25 stakeholders were interviewed. The majority of participants had reported receiving training in biosecurity and biosafety, including use of personal protective equipment. Most respondents reported practicing good biosecurity measures (92%) and good biosafety measures (88%). Physical and socioeconomic barriers to practicing biosecurity were reported to be prevalent for smallholder farmers, which may suggest a gap in the capacity of veterinary services to provide cost-effective and practical biosecurity strategies. Seventy five percent of participants had never or rarely participated in One Health approaches in the field in the last 12 months and 69% reported further training as a high priority. There was a knowledge gap reported amongst district and commune-level veterinary staff about the need for, and awareness of multisectoral collaboration. Respondents that completed postgraduate qualifications in epidemiology or Field Epidemiology Training Programs (adjusted OR: 3.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 9.23, p = 0.046) and had longer job tenure between 10-12 years (OR: 10.38; 95% CI: 3.06, 35.15, p = <0.001) were more likely to have higher levels of experience in One Health. This study identified gaps in knowledge, attitudes and adoption of practices related to biosecurity, biosafety and One Health specifically in lower-level or less experienced veterinary staff without further training opportunities in epidemiology. These findings enable prioritisation of training, policy, and planning activities to further enhance the national capacity of veterinary services in Vietnam.

Abstract: Much has been written on the 2on intervention in Libya and its implications to the R2P principle, but we know less about the lived experience of protection in a context where the post-intervention responsibility for protecting civilians was quickly transferred to the interim authorities who had limited governance capacity. This has resulted in localised protection' where militias, tribal elders, and family members constitute the main actors providing protection to their respective communities. Although this is in line with the growing emphasis on local ownership underwriting UN and donor discourse, a troubling upshot of the localised protection is that it often disempowers, and at times subjects the protected to further insecurity and violence. The aim of this analysis is to explore this dynamic of protection and insecurity. I draw on feminist theorising of the masculine protection logic and argue that civilians in Libya negotiate multiple, gendered protection bargains that often produce perverse outcomes, by subjecting the `protected' to renewed or increased insecurities, rather than reducing them.

Abstract: This paper investigates the determinants of COVID-19 infection in the first 100 days of government actions. Using a debiased LASSO estimator, we explore how different measures of government nonpharmaceutical interventions affect new infections of COVID-19 for 37 lower and middle-income countries (LMCs). We find that closing schools, stay-at-home restrictions, and contact tracing reduce the growth of new infections, as do economic support to households and the number of health care workers. Notably, we find no significant effects of business closures. Finally, infections become higher in countries with greater income inequality, higher tourist inflows, poorly educated adults, and weak governance quality. We conclude that several policy interventions reduce infection rates for poorer countries. Further, economic and institutional factors are important; thereby justifying the use, and ultimately success, of economic support to households during the initial infection period.

Abstract: In the course of history, a large number of politicians have been assassinated. To investigate this phenomenon, rational choice hypotheses are developed and tested using a large data set covering close to 100 countries over a period of 20 years. Several strategies, in addition to security measures, are shown to significantly reduce the probability of politicians being attacked or killed: extended institutional and governance quality, democracy, voice and accountability, a well-functioning system of law and order, decentralization via the division of power and federalism, larger cabinet size and a stronger civil society. There is also support for a contagion effect.

Abstract: The unprecedented rise in debt levels across countries has given rise to the role of institutions on public debt. This study examines the impact of institutions on government debt in a sample of 54 EU and non -EU countries, covering the 2010 to 2022 period, employing the Logistic Quantile Regression (LQR) and Recentered Influence Function (RIF) method, Our results indicate that the effect of institutions varies across the distribution of government debt. The results show that government effectiveness, regulatory quality, voice, and accountability have similar effects in the EU and non -EU countries. However, political stability and the control of corruption have a significant and debt reducing effect only in EU countries. Robustness checks confirm our findings.

Abstract: It has been well documented that cross-listing can improve firms' governance quality and reduce equity financing costs, which are crucial for firms' innovation activities. In this paper, we investigate the effect of cross-listing on the Hong Kong (HK) market on the innovation performance of Chinese mainland firms. We find that both innovation outputs and qualities increase significantly when Chinese mainland firms list their shares on the HK market. Concerning the channels through which cross-listing encourages innovation, we demonstrate that cross-listed firms can raise low-cost funds in the HK market, which facilitates their innovation activities. Moreover, the HK market generates more informative stock prices, which mitigate innovation information asymmetry and also encourage firms' innovation. In general, our paper sheds light on a new factor (cross-listing) that motivates firms to engage in innovation and highlights cross-listing's function in improving innovation.

Abstract: We show a link between levels of mass education in 1870 and corruption levels in 2010 for seventy-eight countries that remains strong when controlling for change in the level of education, GDP/capita, and democracy. A model for the causal mechanism between universal education and control of corruption is presented. Early introduction of universal education is linked to levels of economic equality and to efforts to increase state capacity. First, societies with more equal education gave citizens more opportunities and power for opposing corruption. Secondly, the need for increased state capacity was a strong motivation for the introduction of universal education in many countries. Strong states provided more education to their publics and such states were more common where economic disparities were initially smaller.

Abstract: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, it has been argued that there has been a substantial revision to the norm dictating the behaviour of states in the event of a disease outbreak. This article examines the evolution of the norm to 'report and verify' disease outbreaks and evaluates the extent to which this revised norm has begun to guide state behaviour. Examination of select East Asian countries affected by human infections of the H5N1 (avian influenza) virus strain reveals the need to further understand the mutually constitutive relationship between the value attached to prompt reporting against the capacity to report, and how states manage both in fulfilling their duty to report.

Abstract: Do institutions and culture affect environmental values? In this article we analyze 1041 environmental valuations of 223 wetlands in 38 developing countries, to examine the effect of institutions and culture on environmental values. We assess three dimensions of institutional quality: economic freedom, democracy, and good governance. We also consider the impact of cultural differences. Possibly surprisingly, wetland values are lower in more market based economies and they are lower in cultures that are more indulgent and authoritarian. In contrast, improved government effectiveness increases wetland valuations. Understanding these important and varying effects of institutions and culture on wetland valuations is important for policy development and environmental preservation.

Abstract: The adoption of weak remedies, such as declarations or recommendations by the Bangladesh Supreme Court in litigations on state-induced forced slum evictions, significantly contributes to the tardy implementation of court orders. In this context, there is a growing global consensus on the structural injunction-a remedy that enables judges to monitor and bring about governmental compliance with judicial orders of social rights litigation. The Bangladesh Supreme Court faces several real and compelling challenges relating to its constitutional authority and institutional capacity that hinder remedial innovation. Through examining relevant constitutional provisions, judicial approach, and comparative examples, this article argues that the court has the capacity to overcome these constraints. Thus, it advocates judicial reform in Bangladesh to offset the state's often arbitrary interference with the basic necessity of housing of the slum dwellers.

Abstract: Workable financial mechanisms are essential to abate greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, which contributes a large proportion of total global emissions, must be avoided as an effective emissions-reduction tactic, and to alleviate biodiversity loss and poverty. However, incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) have had mixed and suboptimal success because of opportunity costs and administrative and technical issues, in particular, leakage, permanence, and additionality. We show that these latter concepts can be ambiguous, potentially contrived and in some cases, generate perverse outcomes. Encumbering avoided-deforestation projects with these administrative shackles risks massive increases in global deforestation and a concomitant loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services and emissions-reduction opportunities. We offer a solution built on a proven insurance-based hedging principle, a concept we call iREDD, that could indirectly address specific technical and administrative challenges, whether real or contrived. Project-specific iREDD insurance policies and premiums would be negotiated upfront using a simple assessment of risk based on governance quality, the integrity of management plans, liquidity, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and political acceptability. iREDD acts as both an incentive for prudent forest management given the seller's potential financial windfall if forests are diligently managed, and guarantees not to disenfranchise the buyer.

Abstract: Our working hypothesis is that cross-cultural differences in tax compliance behavior have foundations in the institutions of tax administration and citizen assessment of the quality of governance. Tax compliance being a complex behavioral issue, its investigation requires use of a variety of methods and data sources. Results from artefactual field experiments conducted in countries with substantially different political histories and records of governance quality demonstrate that observed differences in tax compliance levels persist over alternative levels of enforcement. The experimental results are shown to be robust by replicating them for the same countries using survey response measures of tax compliance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In recent years, significant work has emerged exploring the relationship between tourism and mining. Generally, the relationship is considered to be negative, the result of crowding out of tourism during mining booms. However, the relationship is likely to be more complicated with mining affecting tourism both directly and indirectly. The indirect effects arise from the mediation role played by foreign direct investment (FDI), governance quality, trade and the real exchange rate. To verify this hypothesis, this article uses an unbalanced panel data set that covers 190 countries over the 2002-2017 period. A structural equation model is used to account for the mediating relationships. The results show a direct negative relationship between natural resource intensity and international tourist arrivals, as well as indirect positive relationship mediated by FDI partially offset by an indirect negative relationship mediated by governance.

Abstract: Water plays an important role in underpinning equitable, stable and productive societies and ecosystems. Hence, United Nations recognized ensuring water security as one (Goal 6) of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs). Many international river basins are likely to experience 'low water security' over the coming decades. Water security is rooted not only in the physical availability of freshwater resources relative to water demand, but also on social and economic factors (e.g. sound water planning and management approaches, institutional capacity to provide water services, sustainable economic policies). Until recently, advanced tools and methods are available for the assessment of water scarcity. However, quantitative and integrated-physical and socio-economic-approaches for spatial analysis of water security at global level are not available yet. In this study, we present a spatial multi-criteria analysis framework to provide a global assessment of water security. The selected indicators are based on Goal 6 of SDGs. The term 'security' is conceptualized as a function of 'availability', 'accessibility to services', 'safety and quality', and 'management'. The proposed global water security index (GWSI) is calculated by aggregating indicator values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using the ordered weighted average method, which allows for the exploration of the sensitivity of final maps to different attitudes of hypothetical policy makers. Our assessment suggests that countries of Africa, South Asia and Middle East experience very low water security. Other areas of high water scarcity, such as some parts of United States, Australia and Southern Europe, show better GWSI values, due to good performance of management, safety and quality, and accessibility. The GWSI maps show the areas of the world in which integrated strategies are needed to achieve water related targets of the SDGs particularly in the African and Asian continents.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between corporate carbon performance (CCP) and corporate cost of debt (COD) in Asia-Pacific countries. Using a sample of 3666 firm-year observations from 14 countries over the period 2003-2018, COD is found to be lower when a firm has higher carbon performance (CCP). We also find that CCP produces greater reductions in COD for firms in countries with weak governance quality. Thus, a country-level governance mechanism and debt markets are substitutes in addressing corporate carbon performance (CCP). The main results are robust after controlling for sample selection bias and endogeneity problems using alternative model specifications. The results are also robust after controlling for heterogeneity problems using sub-samples, accounting for the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), using an alternative COD measure, and controlling for potential simultaneous causality and for corporate governance variables.

Abstract: The lowland floodplains of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) experience prolonged dry seasons characterized by pronounced and common water scarcity, with water supplies increasingly offset with groundwater. Groundwater assessment is still at a very rudimentary stage in Laos, making it difficult to ensure that new water supplies are developed successfully and managed sustainably. The goal of this study is to apply a variety of field hydrogeophysical techniques to this problem and in the process help build and strengthen human and institutional capacity with various stakeholder groups from the government, the university, and the community. The study area focuses on a cross section of the Vientiane Plain (VP) in the Lower Mekong Basin in central Lao PDR to identify and characterize the hydrogeology and groundwater quality. The research collaboration has built and strengthened stakeholder capacity by developing and progressing the hydrogeologic field mapping of the VP. It has provided local undergraduate and postgraduate training opportunities using several different near-surface geophysical and hydrogeologic techniques, some previously untested in Lao PDR. At one of the survey sites, the geophysics has indicated the spatial extent of the shallow aquifer and in the process identified an extensive conductive zone, interpreted as more saline groundwater. Any groundwater development within this or similar zones is likely to be unsuitable as sources for drinking and irrigation water. Engagement with the local village authorities has supported local community members and government to expand groundwater development for rural water supplies. Access to groundwater as a reliable, safe, and secure resource provides an opportunity for strengthening the resilience of farmers to changing climatic conditions. Participatory research collaboration of this kind can positively enhance data and build capacity, which is a required precursor for improving knowledge and management of poorly understood groundwater resources.

Abstract: Objectives We quantified the contents of existing public health competency frameworks against the elements of the World Federation of Public Health Associations' Global Charter for the Public's Health. Methods We conducted a desktop analysis of eight public health competency frameworks publicly available on the internet. Using a pre-formed template, competency statements from each framework were mapped against the elements of the Global Charter-core public health services (Protection, Promotion and Prevention) and overarching enabling functions (Information, Governance, Capacity, and Advocacy). We then quantified coverage of the Charter's elements in each of the frameworks. Results We found that although the public health competency frameworks vary considerably in terms of coverage and focus, they all cover every element contained in the Global Charter. However, there were a number of areas of competency identified in some frameworks not explicitly referred to in the Charter including cultural safety, human rights and systems thinking. Conclusions The Global Charter provides a mechanism for comparing competency sets, checking public health curricula content, informing competency framework and curricula (re)design, and planning and monitoring workforce needs.

Abstract: Community engagement and local governance are important components of health interventions aiming to empower local populations. Yet, there is limited evidence on how to effectively engage with communities and codevelop interventions, especially in Southeast Asian contexts. Despite rapid progress, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) still has high maternal and child mortality, with essential service coverage showing significant disparities across socioeconomic strata. Long-standing challenges in community health were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by poor trust between users and health providers. However, the pandemic also provided an opportunity to develop approaches for enhanced community engagement and local governance capacity to tackle health inequities. The Community Network Engagement for Essential Healthcare and COVID-19 Responses through Trust (CONNECT) Initiative, developed by the Lao PDR government, WHO and partners, has resulted in initial positive outcomes in community health such as increased vaccination uptake, facility births and trust in health providers. This case study describes the iterative, adaptive process by which the CONNECT Initiative was developed, and how the core components, key stakeholders, theory of change and evaluation framework evolved from grounded observations and hypotheses. Lessons learnt include (1) awareness of entry points and existing structures to strengthen local governance for health through mutually beneficial intersectoral collaboration; (2) building relationships and trust with an adaptive, grounds-up approach for sustainability and scalability. As a model which can be adapted to other settings, this case study provides evidence on how to engage with communities, strengthen local governance and codevelop interventions towards greater health equity.

Abstract: The state of governance in Bangladesh has a chequered history. The country's battle for independence, and its history of military dictatorships and dysfunctional democracy, have brought challenges in terms of establishing a sound system of governance. The five pillars of public governance have posed formidable obstacles to establishing and reforming key institutions, refining processes and strategies of management and guiding the country towards a more efficient and effective system. Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative accountability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, administrative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains. We argue that state institutions have been captured by members of a powerful nexus who have developed a symbiotic relationship with the state, affecting its institutional capacity to reduce corruption, strengthen transparency and accountability, and allow the judiciary and public bureaucracy to work professionally.

Abstract: Mining investment in Indonesia has been at a standstill for a decade. Clearly, international mining companies regard the country as a high risk destination for capital. Yet Indonesia is one of the most highly mineralised countries in the world and has expressed a desire to increase investment in the sector in the coming years. As a first step in this direction the government has introduced a new mineral and coal mining law to replace the highly regarded Contract of Work system. The government argues that this new law will reinvigorate mining investment in the country. This paper suggests that the new mining law will do little to improve the situation. Indeed, it is unlikely that Indonesia will become a preferred destination for mining investment in the foreseeable future. Poor regulatory architecture, endemic corruption, and a lack of institutional capacity continue to be of concern to investors. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study examines the association between corporate carbon performance (CCP) and firm risk using a sample of 9,212 firm-year observations from 13 countries in the Asia-Pacific region over the period 2002 -2021. We also examine the moderating role of the quality of country-level governance in the association between CCP and firm risk. We find that CCP is negatively associated with a firm 's total, idiosyncratic and systematic risk and that country-level governance quality accentuates the negative association between CCP and firm risk. We also find that country-level business culture, emissions trading schemes, climate change performance and attention to carbon emissions accentuate the negative association between CCP and firm risk. Given the growing demands from regulatory bodies for increased transparency on carbon performance, the insights gained from our research hold significant relevance for regulators, policy makers, investors, financial analysts, scholars and businesses.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Governing Ecosystem Carbon

Abstract: Governing carbon stored in natural and human-managed ecosystems is an emerging area in global climate politics. Many developed and developing countries are devising and implementing a range of reform programs that aim to reduce emissions and increase sequestration in the land use, land use change and forestry, and agricultural sectors. In developing countries, mitigation programs and projects on the ground have accelerated under the global program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The article applies a governmentality framework to analyze these policies and programs as forms of administrative, economic, and deliberative rationalities and associated technologies. What emerges in the analysis is that governing is conducted through common technologies including policy instruments and rules, stakeholder engagement processes, and the application of the same technical monitoring and carbon accounting methodologies. In the case of REDD+, there has been strong emphasis on the introduction of market and incentive approaches, but the major reforms have focused on government regulatory programs and building technical and administrative capacity. Importantly, this is allowing national and sub-national governments to extend their authority across all aspects of the reform agenda, which poses significant challenges for reducing forest loss in developing countries.

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of foreign bank presence on the Vietnamese banking sector. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2005 to 2020, this study establishes a link between the presence of foreign banks and increased competitiveness in the Vietnamese market. As more foreign banks enter the local market, domestic banks tend to experience diminished profits and take on higher levels of risk. Local banks respond by increasing the riskiness of their loan portfolios, particularly through greater corporate credit issuance. The study further reveals that these impacts vary according to domestic banks' size, ownership structure, governance quality, and income diversification. Furthermore, the modes of foreign bank penetration also exhibit differential effects. The findings maintain validity through rigorous robustness checks employing various econometric methods and alternative variables. This research carries significant implications for policymakers, commercial banks, and stakeholders in the globalising banking system.

Abstract: Drawing insights from Aaron Wildavsky's studies of the craft of policy making and from the literature on pluralization in Chinese decision making, this article examines the role played by the biggest state-owned enterprise, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), in shaping the country's electricity policy in the early twenty-first century. Specifically, it discusses how and why SGCC was able to sell its ultra-high-voltage projects as a solution to shortages of electricity. The article argues that (a) central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are not mere passive receivers of policy directives from the party-state; (b) those with long-term strategic vision, human and financial resources, and institutional capacity can shape government policies to their liking as policy advocates; and yet (c) no one, including central SOEs, monopolizes this process in any given policy area; and thus policy outcomes reflect competition among players and their constant interaction with government policy makers.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of institutions on regional financial development using a panel data model of 11 East Asian countries during 1996-2017. It divides the institutional factors into six economic factors and six legal-political factors. The analysis demonstrates that the legal-political institutional factors have a stronger impact on financial development than the economic institutional factors in East Asia. Improvement in institutional quality such as fiscal freedom, business freedom, control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality and rule of law can promote financial development. Improvements of these institutional factors facilitate the ability of enterprises to allocate resources and improve the strength of business operations, thereby reducing transaction costs and making the financial operating environment fairer and more efficient. With the improvement of institutional factors, financial development will have more opportunities to develop better. Institutional impacts are more pronounced in the financial development in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar than in the other countries such as China, Japan, Korea and Singapore.

Abstract: Increasing demands for energy to boost the Mekong economies have attracted the keen interest of riparian countries for hydropower development. This is evidenced by extensive investment in hydropower projects across the region over the last few decades. Drawing on interviews with key stakeholders, including officials from Ministry of Energy and Mines, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, private sector actors, civil society organisations and academics, as well as secondary data from public and policy resources, this paper aims to examine how the government of Laos' (GoL) decisions in hydropower development are influenced by regional energy dynamics, and how these shape the country's future energy development. The paper argues that the GoL's decisions on hydropower development are highly dilemmatic, given the current limited institutional capacity in hydropower governance and the accelerating evolution of alternative energy in neighbouring countries. While uncertainty in power markets is recognised, this places greater pressure on new hydropower projects as to how much power could be sufficiently produced and exported. The paper calls for GoL's policy considerations on the development and planning of alternative energy to secure the sustainable and equitable use of water resources as stipulated in the 1995 Mekong Agreement.

Abstract: In the new era of reform, China has witnessed a changing relationship between its government and the society as well as the market, and accordingly, initiated its governance mode reform. This paper, firstly, briefs on how government-led governance mode gets proposed in China and analyzes its necessity for the time being. Secondly, the paper elaborates on the value orientation and characteristics of such a mode, i.e. fairness as the main target, the Party and government's leading role in governance, equal stress laid on rule of law and rule of morality, and the involvement of multiple governance bodies. And lastly, the paper puts forward the following feasible approaches such as cultivating a justice-centered multiple governance notion, enhancing government capacity, advancing open administration, further promoting the political participation and consultation of the market, nonprofit organizations and citizens, and establishing a sound and effective investment system of public finance.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Does who I am and what I feel determine what I see (or say)? A meta-analytic systematic review exploring the influence of real and perceived bodily state on spatial perception of the external environment

Abstract: Background: Bodily state is theorised to play a role in perceptual scaling of the environment, whereby low bodily capacity shifts visuospatial perception, with distances appearing farther and hills steeper, and the opposite seen for high bodily capacity. This may play a protective role, where perceptual scaling discourages engaging with the environment when capacity is low. Methodology: Our protocol was pre-registered via Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/6zya5/) with all amendments to the protocol tracked. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the role of bodily state/capacity on spatial perception measures of the environment. Databases (Medline, PsychINFO, Scopus, Embase, and Emcare) and grey literature were searched systematically, inclusive to 26/8/21. All studies were assessed using a customised Risk of Bias form. Standard mean differences and 95% CIs were calculated via meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 8,034 studies were identified from the systematic search. Of these, 68 experiments (3,195 participants) met eligibility and were included in the review. These were grouped into the following categories: fatigue; pain; age; embodiment; body size/body paty size; glucose levels; fitness; and interoception, and interoceptive accuracy. We found low level evidence (limited studies, high risk of bias) for the effect of bodily state on spatial perception. There was consistent evidence that both glucose manipulations and age influence spatial perception of distances and hills in a hypothesised direction (lower capacity associated with increased distance and hill steepness). Mixed evidence exists for the influence of external loads, embodiment, body/body-part size manipulations, pain, and interoceptive accuracy. Evidence for fitness and/or fatigue influencing spatial perception was conflicting; notably, methodological flaws with fitness and fatigue paradigms and heterogenous spatial perception measures may underlie null/conflicting results. Conclusion: We found limited evidence for bodily state influencing spatial perception of the environment. That all studies had high risk of bias makes conclusions about reported effects reflecting actual perceptual shifts (vs merely reflecting experimental demands or error due to inadequate study design) pre-emptive. Rigorous evaluation is needed to determine whether reported effects reflect more than bias (e.g., experimental demands, inadequate blinding). Future work using reliable measures of spatial perception, comprehensive evaluation of relevant confounders, and methodologically robust (and experimentally confirmed) bodily state experimental paradigms is warranted.

Abstract: As data proceeds through different levels of an organisation from its capture to its processing and refinement, it is reported as information relevant to a particular application. Data can be adversely influenced during this conversion process which can result in sub-optimal decisions being made. The collection and handling of information for a water authority must therefore be organised. Asset management systems generally consist of three major constituents: inventory, programmed action, and optimisation. The institutional capacity needs of water authorities in developing countries require greater emphasis on the first of these two constituents. A pragmatic and simple-to-use Integrated Water-Asset Management System (IWAMS) has been developed comprising water meter, leakage control and incident management modules. A water audit and Water balance module facilitates the determination of the levels of unaccounted for water, as well as the unit cost of leakage. Water mains rehabilitation priorities can be established through the representation of various data collected in the form of a common severity rating that aids decision making.

Abstract: Aquaculture of bivalve shellfish and seaweed represents a global opportunity to simultaneously advance coastal ecosystem recovery and provide substantive benefits to humanity. To identify marine ecoregions with the greatest potential for development of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture to meet this opportunity, we conducted a global spatial analysis using key environmental (e.g., nutrient pollution status), socioeconomic (e.g., governance quality), and human health factors (e.g., wastewater treatment prevalence). We identify a substantial opportunity for strategic sector development, with the highest opportunity marine ecoregions for shellfish aquaculture centered on Oceania, North America, and portions of Asia, and the highest opportunity for seaweed aquaculture distributed throughout Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North and South America. This study provides insights into specific areas where governments, international development organizations, and investors should prioritize new efforts to drive changes in public policy, capacity-building, and business planning to realize the ecosystem and societal benefits of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture.

Abstract: This paper describes a research-training project for building social science research capacity at the National University of Laos (NUOL), supported by IDRC. At the international level, the project was structured as a flexible network of resource persons from six countries. The main successes of the project turned out to be unanticipated: the project offered significant insights to NUOL'S ongoing assessment of its administrative capacity to manage university-based research. The flexibility of the network approach, combined with a structure that oriented the international network toward engaging with, and responding to, needs articulated by NUOL staff, proved crucial to the project's ability to respond to changing institutional needs in NUOL. The importance of paying careful attention to how projects can be structured so that they are responsive to Southern needs has been heightened by intensified pressure in Canadian universities to generate funds, while promoting excellence in research and training takes a backseat.

Abstract: A public health crisis is a "touchstone" for testing the ability and capacity of a national health system. In the current era, public health crises are presenting new systematic and cross-border characteristics and uncertainty. The essence of a system for public health crisis governance is the rules administering the stimulus-response chain. The health system generally emphasizes joint participation and communication between different subjects, which may lead to overlap and redundancy as well as a lack of auxiliary support for major public health crisis events. In the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, we track the responses, challenges, and implications of the temporary disruption of the health system and its response to this major public health crisis. We examine local governance capacity, performance in pandemic control, and the coordinated responses to COVID-19. Accordingly, we identify the challenges to the health system, including the imbalance in attention given to medical care versus health care, insufficient grassroots public health efforts and control capacity, and untimely information disclosure. It is strongly suggested that the government improve its cognitive ability and focus more attention on building and strengthening the emergency health system.

Abstract: There is no proper mechanism for monitoring the effectiveness of indigenous legislation and evaluating its application in the day-to-day practice of the public administration and society. This paper firstly identifies and conceptualises the variables of state capacity and, secondly, provides empirical advances that analyse state capacity under each variable to demonstrate in practice how those variables influence or determine the actual enjoyment of the indigenous peoples' rights in Malaysial. For the purposes of this analysis and from the literature review (14,45), this analysis has identified the following variables: (i) accountability; (ii) legal legitimacy; (iii) political will; and (iv) capacity building and resources. This paper however will focus on the first variable: state accountability. The analysis clearly illustrates the implementation gap in the public administration. With few exceptions, state bureaucracy reacts as a state capitalist or rent-seizing state towards new legislation or policy passed in favour of indigenous peoples and, in doing so, rejects the recognition of the indigenous peoples' rights.

Abstract: Mining and other economic activities are carried out on a particular territory and, thus, affect the natural and human environment in which they operate. As a consequence and in order to avoid future and eventual socioenvironmental conflicts, it is essential to guarantee that these human activities are conducted in a manner that respects both environment and society. One of the most powerful tools to achieve this balance between human activities and sustainable development is Land -Use Planning (LUP), understood as the institution charged with organizing human activities to achieve that balance. Bearing this in mind, the present article has three objectives: a) complement the literature on LUP by explaining the interconnection between LUP and the mining concessions regime, b) identify and analyze the main problems with the procedures for granting mining concessions in Peru, and c) propose the foundations for a future integrated system of mining concessions and LUP based on common principles and participatory mechanisms to reconcile tensions between the interests and values of all stakeholders, in addition to providing alternative solutions to the current problems with the mining concessions regime. To analyze the mining concessions regime and LUP a qualitative methodology is adopted, combining documentary analysis, review of official reports, and semi -structured interviews with key actors. Taking into consideration the stated objectives, this research concludes that: a) to achieve sustainable development and prevent the future emergence of conflicts, mining concessions must be granted based on territorial planning that the State (at the national, regional and local levels) should undertake prior to and in conjunction with civil society; b) the mining concession procedure lacks mechanisms of good governance, environmental sustainability and social justice; and c) as an alternative solution to these issues, this research suggests the creation of an integrated system of LUP and mining concessions, one that is binding, efficient, gradual, investor -friendly and intercultural.

Abstract: Since there is a general perception that the defence industry is more susceptible to corruption compared to other sectors, using a unique database provided by Transparency International (TI), we examine the role of firm level antecedents on firm level corruption risk in the defence industry. We find that larger firms have lower levels of firm level corruption risk. Managerial shareholding is associated with higher levels of corruption risk. Firms that voluntarily disclose more information regarding their corruption control systems tend to have lower levels of corruption risk. Finally, listed firms also have lower levels of firm level corruption risk. We find that the "listing effect" is stronger among firms in financially developed countries ostensibly due to the better scrutiny and monitoring by market participants. In our analysis, we control for country level variables such as a composite index of government effectiveness in controlling defence industry corruption.

Abstract: Background: Trade agreements in the 21st century have evolved to include provisions that affect domestic public policy and public health in signatory countries. There are growing calls for health professionals and public health advocates to pursue an active advisory role in trade negotiations in order to anticipate and prevent negative outcomes for health services and public health. Aim: This scoping review explored current literature to identify existing knowledge of the implications of trade agreements for the nursing workforce, nursing practice and public health using as an example the 2018 'Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership'. Design: Scoping review Data sources: Emerald Insight, Informit, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and a number of specialist Economics, International Trade and Business, and International Relations databases. Grey literature included national and international policy documents. Review method: Literature was selected according to extraction field criteria, supplemented by hand searching of relevant grey literature and snowballing references from the selected literature reference lists. Analysis was undertaken to identify key themes emerging from the literature. Review results: Six key themes relevant to nursing workforce, nursing practice or public health were 1. Lack of consultation with public health and health professionals in trade negotiations; 2. Implications of strengthened intellectual property provisions for equitable access to medicines (including biologics) and medical devices; 3. Threats to government capacity to regulate domestic policy for public health and health services through 'Investor State Dispute Settlement' provisions 4. Threats to government capacity to regulate domestic policy for public health and health services through 'Regulatory Coherence' 5. Potential limited benefits to communities and increased health inequities 6. Potential implications of increased temporary migration. Gaps were identified in the literature for implications for nursing practice and the nursing workforce from regulatory and labour provisions of trade agreements. Conclusions: The analysis of the literature reviewed is of international importance for the nursing workforce, nursing practice and public health. Policymakers must anticipate and respond to how the inclusion of labour or regulatory provisions in trade agreements will affect nursing practice and the nursing workforce, and how this may subsequently impact on the health of communities globally.

Abstract: This study examines the relatively recent growth of the international labour market, particularly in the service industry, for temporary employment of university graduates from China. By examining the push and pull factors from the home and destination country, we treat the international labour market as a geographic and institutional space which is created by the institutional actors and in which these actors interact. Through 56 interviews conducted with 38 informants, this study examines the actions and interactions of institutional actors at the local level to develop insights into how these actors shape the space of this segment of the labour market through, for example, the insertion into the global labour market chain, human resource sourcing, training and development. The paper concludes by arguing that the development of the international labour market for Chinese university graduates is contingent upon the agency role and attitude of key institutional actors. And its current situation indicates a fragmented and piecemeal development with limited government support, institutional capacity and individual motivation.

Abstract: Can green states exist in a non-Western context? Much research has been focused on environmental politics in advanced industrialized economies, and the associated institutions, policy, and resources available for environmental protection efforts. Outside this narrow context however, we know far less about the progress states have made in developing their national systems of environmental governance. This gap in our understanding is particularly evident when it comes to the post-Soviet context. Using a case study of Georgia, this analysis evaluates environmental governance capacity in a transition state drawing on a framework derived from the green state literature. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Georgia has faced considerable political and economic upheaval, and in the midst of it all, the country has embarked on an ambitious program of environmental reform. The findings suggest that while the basic internal foundations of a green state exist, including considerable policy and legislative development and solid environmental financing, key challenges remain. These are centered on an unstable institutional environment, and weak policy enforcement. However non-state actors such as NGOs and international organizations provide crucial support and are likely to remain essential in building and maintaining environmental capacity in the future.

Abstract: Climate change presents an enormous development challenge to urban slums or informal settlements in the developing world. While the social vulnerability of rural communities to climate change has been extensively studied in the Global South, little is known about their counterparts living in urban slums and informal settlements. Using Accra, Ghana as a case study, this paper examines the social, economic and institutional drivers of vulnerability to climate change in three slums or informal settlements. The study draws on a mixed method research project that integrates theories from social vulnerability and political ecology. Results demonstrate a low awareness about climate change with the drivers of vulnerability in slums being poor quality housing, poor infrastructure and service provision, low participation in adaptation decision-making, as well as weak institutional capacity. Our results underscore the need for genuine participatory adaptation planning which will assist in mapping the specific vulnerabilities of slums and help identify what appropriate interventions are needed to protect assets and rebuild the adaptive capacities of slum residents.

Abstract: A major challenge for tourism as a social and economic activity and as an academic study is the integration of multiple perspectives into coherent frameworks. This paper explores this challenge and argues that a social representations approach allows for the critical analysis of formal approaches to tourism planning. Special attention is given to tourism development and governance in Africa and other emerging destinations. A content/semiotic analysis was conducted to examine figures summarising tourism planning models presented in the academic and government planning literature. This revealed a dominant social representation of tourism planning in which destination residents play only a minor role and are typically excluded from tourism governance and external agents, from both the private and public sectors, and their views of tourist needs are dominant. Most planning models were narrowly focused, had limited evaluation of all tourism benefits and costs, paid little attention to non-economic factors and did not integrate into wider development processes. The paper argues that this social representation assumes the core objective of tourism planning is to enhance outcomes for tourists and tourism businesses rather than for destination residents. Measures to enhance local governance capacity are suggested, with examples from the health, education and tourism sectors.

Abstract: In the context of flood research, scholars and practitioners have recognised that Western-knowledge-driven engineering-based flood management techniques are insufficient for successful water use and management in urban design and planning practices, while ideas, practices, and knowledge from local people are essential. Traditional water knowledge (TWK) explains people's profound understanding of natural processes and the ecological dependencies of water systems and connections with their local water system and the land, beliefs, sense, and practices that are an integral part of their culture. However, the concept of traditional knowledge may differ from scientific knowledge, as it represents a different worldview perspective from a modern Westernised world. Considering Khulna City, Bangladesh, as a case, this paper investigates the salient challenges and opportunities to integrate TWK with present urban design and planning practices. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, including relevant government officials, NGO workers, researchers, urban professionals, and local elders. This study finds that TWK can contribute to urban design and planning practices by identifying helpful ecosystem services and site-specific information; by sharing strategies for surface water protection, open-space design, and rainwater harvesting; and encouraging design of spaces for psychological benefit, and ensuring sustainability and building flood resilience in an urban context. Furthermore, this research demonstrates how these elements relate to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, issues with knowledge transmission, the identification of the actual knowledge holders, poor governance, weak urban planning, minimal institutional capacity, and perceived cultural inferiority are significant challenges restricting the integration of TWK, despite its relevance to sustainability. This paper suggests that considering traditional water use and management is necessary to develop flood resilience in an urban context in a sustainable way.

Abstract: In this paper I analyze investors' reactions to changes in the expense ratios of equity mutual funds. I show that investment flows' response to fees cannot be fully explained by looking at investors' performance sensitivity. While performance sensitivity monotonically increases with past performance, price sensitivity does not: investors who buy top past performers seem to be "distracted" by the fund's previous return and pay relatively little attention to the expense ratios. Moreover price sensitivity increases with fund visibility while performance sensitivity decreases, and while looking at data from 1986 to 2006 no discernible trend can be observed in the average performance sensitivity, price sensitivity strongly increases due to the dramatic increase in the availability of mutual funds' information for retail investors. Finally I show that investment companies strategically time their repricing decisions in order to exploit time variations in price and performance sensitivities, and that fund governance quality affects the degree to which investment companies engage in this opportunistic behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the initial changes and continuing challenges that are faced by teachers and students due to the unexpected transition to online learning from the COVID-19 pandemic at Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia. For this, the authors applied a phenomenological-case-study design, collecting qualitative data from purposively selected Ph.D. students (n = 10) and teachers (n = 4), examiners (n = 2), as well as the postgraduate coordinator. The results indicate that the teachers experienced some difficulties in effectively using learning technologies. Moreover, the students were overburdened with increased accountability and excessive challenges. However, the institutional capacity to support was relatively minimal. Despite these odds, the study participants showed higher levels of willingness and completed the program successfully. The study participants reported moderate satisfaction with their personal and professional experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to remind universities and colleges about the essential skills that students need in this unpredictable world, for example, informed decision making, creative problem solving, and adaptability.

Abstract: Rhino poaching in South Africa and India's major range states have been remarkably similar over time. Organised criminal syndicates manage an illegal supply chain of rhino horns from poachers, middlemen and corrupt authorities to East Asian black-markets. In this paper, we use rhino poaching data from South Africa and India to examine the plausibility of transnational links and coordination in their supplies of rhino horns. We develop an innovative model of oligopolistic collusion in supply and find empirical evidence to support the theory, while controlling for rhino horn demand features, corruption, governance quality, and conservation policy. Furthermore, we propose an inventory management model of a criminal syndicate that controls the horn supply chain. The method retraces and forecasts black-market prices and has potential applicability in estimating supply or demand elasticities. This paper is the first to suggest an oligopolistic feature of the poaching industry. It highlights the need to reorient conservation policy to account for possible coordination of rhino horn supplies between range states.

Abstract: BackgroundPatients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are increasing worldwide. This is especially paramount in low and middle income countries in which ESRD patients are struggling to access specialist services e.g. hemodialysis (HD). Benchmarking analysis of the offered healthcare packages in several countries and comparison of the utilized alternative healthcare models for ESRD patients may be auspicious for institutional capacity-building in the existing healthcare facilities. Main aim of this study was to perform a benchmarking and evidence-informed gap analysis of the ESRD care provision in Iran and recognize the gaps that cause diversification in care quality for ESRD patients that hinder efforts for care quality improvement in the Iranian National Healthcare System.MethodsDimensions of the Australian Anglicare Southern Queensland Clinical and Care Governance Framework (ASQCGF) were utilized as corner stones of a comprehensive clinical care plan that is essential in responding to HD patients' needs in Iran. An extensive literature search was performed at the next stage to recognize the gold standard core elements. The ascertained components were assigned to the five separate dimensions of the ASQCGF and a preliminary draft (comprehensive package of care for HD patients) was prepared. A checklist was developed at a later stage which was sent to a panel of expert consisting professional healthcare providers in nephrology and hemodialysis wards for their opinions. A gap analysis was conducted to evaluate current care processes of the Iranian HD patients align with the elements of the gold standard framework.ResultsThe identified deficits were classified in five areas in accord with the elements of ASQCGF as follow: A) supply of resources, medical devices and equipment support B) recruitment and endorsement of clinics and general work force C) infection prevention and controlling procedures D) care effectiveness monitoring and quality improvement E) provision of safe environment for both HD patients and hospitals' staff.ConclusionsThe study findings revealed considerable gaps in providing quality HD services to the Iranian HD patients that herald their therapeutic unmet needs and the shift that is needed to narrow down the widening organizational failure which fuels the current disenchantment among the both healthcare providers and HD patients.

We found that research collaborations were dominated within the biophysical sub-system (65.3%) since the knowledge predevelopment period (1900-1983), with continuous increases (by 18.5%) during the rapid development (1984-2000) and the stabilisation (12.9% increase) (2001-2017). However, research collaborations related to the societal sub-system remained marginalised (varied at about 1%), while those related to the governance sub-system expanded in issues studied (32.8%) but were not supported by the core governance disciplines (3.4%). The key findings explained why global river basins are degraded from the perspective of knowledge development and they can assist the strategic planning and management of scientific research for improving governance capacity in modifying the relationship between human and nature on river basins in the Anthropocene. Tackling challenges in the Anthropocene requires transformation of the current pattern of knowledge development, a revolution in the governance of science.

Abstract: Community Forestry (CF) is recognized globally as a forest management regime with the potential to address deforestation and forest degradation, provide forest goods and services to local communities and contribute to climate change mitigation. Around 4% of Bhutan's forests are currently under CF management and these forests provide essential goods and services for local communities. However, the potential of CF in Bhutan to contribute to climate change mitigation is not well understood and has not been researched. In this study, we estimated the carbon stock and carbon sequestration of community forests in Bhutan by using data from the 2015 National Forest Inventory (NFI). The total biomass carbon in community forests was 130.3 Mg ha  1 (107.3-153.2) and the soil organic carbon was 52.8 Mg ha  1 (30.4-75.1). Carbon sequestration was 0.7 Mg ha  1 yr-1. Other attributes: basal area, stem density and tree height, were also determined to assess forest condition and the potential to increase carbon sequestration. The values for biomass carbon in Bhutan's community forests as well as the non-community forests (all other forests) were similar to those reported from Forest Resource Assessment and NFI for forests in Nepal and the Indian Himalayan states respectively. Disaggregation of data from 38 research studies across the Himalayan region indicated that biomass carbon in Bhutan's forests was significantly lower than that in well-stocked (nondegraded) forests in the Indian and Nepal Himalayas. It was also much lower than that in Bhutan's Forest Management Units, which were used as an indicator of the potential upper limit of biomass carbon in Bhutan's forest environment. Similarly, basal area, stem density and mean tree height were also lower in Bhutan's community forests than in well-stocked forests in other Himalayan countries. The Bhutan Government is currently exploring the potential to generate revenue from the sale of carbon sequestered in its forests. This study confirms that there is potential to increase carbon sequestration by improving management of existing forests. Currently, the 107,866 ha of community forests in Bhutan store about 19 million Mg of carbon. With improved management by Community Forest Management Groups, which have the institutional capacity to control local management outcomes, the carbon stock could likely be doubled (to 40 million Mg of carbon), thereby demonstrating the potential of Community Forestry to play an important role in climate change mitigation, while not jeopardizing the provision of day-to-day goods and services to local communities.

Abstract: I examine the impact of the transition to local democratic elections on vigilantism in Indonesia. Using an event study model, I find that the introduction of local elections led to an increase in vigilante conflict, consistent with most theory and qualitative evidence focussing on national level impacts. I determine that the effects are particularly noteworthy in long-established districts and that the impacts are positively associated with rising state-led violence in law enforcement, results that argue against the propositions that lack of state capacity leads to rising vigilantism and that vigilantism serves to substitute for the state's weak enforcement of law. Contrary to other research, I find no evidence of increased vigilantism in the run-up to direct local elections, and I establish that vigilante conflict appears to be short-lived after the initiation of local elections, a determination that helps to resolve another debate in the literature.

Abstract: There is growing concern over the conservation status of sharks and relatives exposed to fishing mortality. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999 adopted the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA), which provides nations with advice on adopting and implementing national plans. An assessment of global national and regional plans of action on sharks (NPOAs) found: most are out of date; limited use of specific, measurable and timebound objectives and activities; no outcome objectives; and few performance assessments. This makes most NPOAs inadequate for planning and assessing efficacy. Over 33% of the annual retained catch of sharks and relatives was from countries without NPOAs and less than 12% was from countries with current NPOAs. NPOAs identified fisheries management framework deficits, ecology knowledge gaps, institutional capacity and coordination shortfalls, and budget constraints as the largest obstacles to implementation and are improvement priorities. We recommend how to amend the IPOA to better support the adoption and effective design and implementation of NPOAs for evidence-informed conservation and management.

Abstract: It is widely agreed that recent decades have witnessed a power shift towards the emerging economies. Yet the magnitude of the power shift and its implications for the global economic order are much contested. For some, the diffusion of power has been changing the power relations between the global North and global South as well as within the global South. For others, the emerging economies do not pose a significant challenge to the global North's dominance in the global political economy as the latter continues to hold structural power advantages in technology, finance, and institutional capacity. This paper contributes to this debate by analysing the changing power relations in the field of development cooperation. As shown by recent work, Chinese development finance, combining a massive scale, global reach, and distinctive modalities, has reshaped the global landscape of development finance. This paper offers an interpretation of this transformation with a focus on power relations. It argues that Chinese development finance has not only decreased the ability of Western development finance institutions to influence policy agendas and preferences in the developing world, but also eroded the latter's power to shape the governance, norms, and modalities of development cooperation.

Abstract: This paper investigates remediation of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 material weaknesses (MWs). Prior research examines full remediation of all MWs or broad categories thereof. We build on these studies by investigating remediation of specific types of MW, thus measuring progress in improving controls made by companies that have not fully remediated all problems. Specifically, we investigate whether specific MW types differ in remediation likelihood and in the association of remediation with earnings quality. Results show that remediation rates of specific MW types vary, and that remediation of specific types is differentially associated with availability of company resources and corporate governance quality. We also find that remediation of some MW types is significantly associated with changes in abnormal accruals (e.g., entity-level problems in reconciliation and information technology, along with account-specific problems in revenue and tax). Finally, results show that problems remaining unremediated for two years are significantly associated with increased abnormal accruals, regardless of type.

Abstract: Within the context of ecological civilization, this study examines Pakistan's path toward green urbanization. This study's main driving force is Pakistan's rapidly urbanizing landscape, which makes it imperative to address environmental degradation and advance sustainable development. A paradigm change towards green urbanization is required because of the multiple environmental difficulties brought about by urbanization in Pakistan, such as pollution, resource depletion, and habitat loss. This study examines the current status of green urbanization in Pakistan through a thorough analysis using a mixed-methods methodology that combines quantitative data analysis with qualitative evaluations. The findings show that, although there are regional variations in the extent of implementation, there is a growing consciousness of and desire to implement eco-friendly policies and practices within urban areas. Goals for green urbanization are seriously hampered by issues including poor infrastructure, scarce resources, and institutional capacity limitations. However, there are encouraging indications of development such as programs supporting green building techniques, sustainable transportation, and renewable energy. Beyond the confines of academia, the research has implications that teach stakeholders, legislators, and urban planners about the necessity of incorporating ecological principles into urban development initiatives. Pakistan can reduce environmental risks, increase climate change resistance, and promote inclusive, sustainable cities for future generations by adopting green urbanization.

Abstract: Water trading has been proposed as an effective mechanism for delivering economic benefits within environmental limits. It represents one possibility for applying a dynamic allocation framework within which environmental river flows can be monitored and improved to support ecological, cultural, aesthetical and recreational values. Based on international experience, requirements for the successful implementation of water trading are assessed in the Aotearoa-New Zealand context. It is concluded that, if the environment is recognised as a water user, water trading has potential to promote sustainable water use but is associated with significant set-up and ongoing costs. A co-governance policy framework for water trading has not been agreed by iwi/hapu and the Crown based on Te Tiriti o Waitangi (1840). The institutional capacity required for development and implementation of trading is currently lacking, and the roles that government agencies and iwi/hapu would play are unclear. Market operational requirements relating to collection, collation and communication of hydrological data are only partially in place. Finally, New Zealand's flashy hydrology is not conducive to seasonal water trading and smaller catchments may contain insufficient users to constitute a functioning market. Water trading should therefore not be viewed as an easily implementable solution for improved freshwater management.

Abstract: This paper examines the determinants of foreign participation in life insurance markets across 24 OECD countries during the period 1993-2000. The empirical results show that socio-economic and market structure factors influence foreign participation in life insurance markets. More specifically, life expectancy, foreign market share, income, dependency ratio, financial development, level of competition, economic growth and market liberalisation have positive impacts, whereas expense/combined ratios and social security expenditure have negative impacts on foreign participation in life insurance markets. In addition, governance/legal indicators (common law, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, the rule of law and control of corruption) all show positive impacts on foreign participation in life insurance markets.

Abstract: An increasing number of countries are implementing strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to support the development of environmentally sustainable policies, plans and programs. However, some Global South countries are yet to legislate for SEA and research is needed to understand the contextual challenges to implementing SEA effectively in these jurisdictions. Here, we examine Mexico's first attempt at applying SEA to assess the potential impacts of urban development plans on a city-wide scale, including those on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Using stakeholder interviews and reflexive thematic analysis, we identify and discuss key factors to consider when formally implementing SEA in Mexico for it to achieve its intended objectives. We relate our findings to existing studies on SEA in Global South countries and discuss contextual challenges that may be shared by these jurisdictions, namely: limited knowledge and experience with SEA, low trust in public institutions, and limited institutional capacity of environmental agencies. We then provide recommendations for addressing these shared challenges, which may also prove useful for countries experiencing difficulties with the application of SEA.

Abstract: This paper uses systems analysis to examine the factors that influence leakage in Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) projects in tropical forest areas in developing countries. A causal loop diagram is used to identify some key intervention points for stakeholders to reduce the negative impacts of leakage. One of the most important intervention points identified is to provide livelihood alternatives to supplement the resources and the income that neighbouring small-scale landholders and communities must forego for the REDD initiative to be successful. The question remains, however, of how best to organise and distribute these resource allocations and payments to support the REDD project objectives. It is concluded that in many cases, developing countries with tropical forest coverage are unlikely to benefit from REDD in the foreseeable future, because of constraints related to economies of scale, but also because of political instability and lack of institutional capacity in many of these nations. Moreover, the risk remains that many of these developing countries will suffer from cross-border market leakage due to REDD projects conducted elsewhere, and that this will lead to negative local forest conservation and livelihood outcomes.

Abstract: We employ an extended Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model combined with the environmental Kuznets curve and machine learning algorithms, including ridge and lasso regression, to investigate the impact of institutions on carbon emissions in a sample of 22 European Union countries over 2002 to 2020. Splitting the sample into two: those with weak and strong institutions, we find that the results differ between the two groups. Our results suggest that changes in institutional quality have a limited impact on carbon emissions. Government effectiveness leads to an increase in emissions in the European Union countries with stronger institutions, whereas voice and accountability lead to a fall in emissions. In the group with weaker institutions, political stability and the control of corruption reduce carbon emissions. Our findings indicate that variables such as population density, urbanization and energy consumption are more important determinants of carbon emissions in the European Union compared to institutional governance. The results suggest the need for coordinated and consistent policies that are aligned with climate targets for the European Union as a whole.

Abstract: During recent decades capitalist forces have altered the geography of economic production and intensified the de-industrialisation of old industrial regions (OIRs). Various regional development prescriptions have followed including place-based concepts centred upon the stronger involvement of local and regional actors. Yet in promoting a shift beyond overly centralist responses, important questions remain about local institutional capacity, especially within OIRs given frequent attention to institutional paralysis and fragmentation. Although more fruitful evolutionary perspectives can be identified, ground level outcomes remain uncertain. This paper focuses on the Black Country OIRs within the English West Midlands where a transformational vision resulted from sub-regional joint working during the 2000s. Whilst acknowledging important external drivers, not least state support for new spaces of governance, a constructivist perspective is presented to more fully understand why a transformative collaborative approach emerged. Particular attention is given to the role of Black Country advocates in creating dilemmas, questioning traditions and challenging existing beliefs. Place-based development approaches therefore do emerge in a latent sense but must be actively constructed. Even then, substantial limitations exist stemming from continuing institutional influences.

Abstract: More than two decades have passed since the start of the worldwide market-oriented electricity sector reforms. The reforms have varied in terms of structure, market mechanisms, and regulation. However, the passage of time calls for taking stock of the performance of the reforms in developing countries. This paper surveys the empirical literature on electricity sector reforms and draws some conclusions with a view to the future. Overall, the reforms have tended to improve the technical efficiency of the sector. The macroeconomic benefits of reforms are less clear and remain difficult to identify. Also, the gains from the reforms have often not trickled down to consumers because of institutional and regulatory weaknesses. In order to achieve lasting benefits, reforms need to adopt measures that align their pursuit of economic efficiency with those of equity and provision of access. Reforms can deliver more economic benefits and alleviate poverty when the poor have access to electricity. New technologies and institutional capacity building can help improve the performance of reforms.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has swept the world, leaving behind a trail of free-falling economy, misery and death. The most vulnerable are the hardest hit-the elderly, those with chronic noncommunicable diseases and the poor and marginalised in society. The experience of various countries in handling the pandemic has shown that robustness of health system with surge capacity is critical to take the pandemic head-on. In the process important lessons for health systems have emerged. Countries with political leaders who led with a principled approach, while adopting an early and comprehensive strategy to contain the virus, have done better. Vulnerable populations should not be left to be further marginalised. To deal with the 'infodemic', communities should be engaged early. For successful handling of future challenges investment in public health is a must. National readiness and response capacity for epidemic control and disease surveillance need to be strengthened, leveraging modern technology. Institutional capacity building, pooling resources and harnessing innovations through partnerships would be key for mounting effective response now and in the future.

Abstract: Peacekeeping operations, mandated through the United Nations and regional bodies, play an increasingly diverse role in the economic development of post-conflict countries. A key way that missions can use their administrative capacity to support economic recovery is developing effective technology use and acquisition strategies in host countries, which is a peacekeeping-wide policy goal outlined in the high-level Performance Peacekeeping report. Our paper introduces the theoretical channels through which missions' use of information communication technologies (ICTs) can support local economic development in post-conflict settings, making a theoretical argument that draws on both the literature on ICTs in peacekeeping and in economic development. We specify a Cobb-Douglas model that describes the potential impact of peacekeeping mission-led ICT investment on longer term economic development in combination with statistics on mission technology spending and internet use in host countries, providing a formal scaffold for our theoretical argument. Using this model and data in combination with a case study of the Central African Republic-based United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic mission, we argue that peacekeeping missions should use their purchasing power and stabilizing influence to attract value-added technology investment to support economic development.

Abstract: Bertrand Badie's thought opened up a number of new research avenues in the field of international relations, on topics ranging from diplomacy to power strategies to the effects of globalization. Yet one of the contributions of that thought remains relatively unexplored in international relations literature: the discussion surrounding the sociology of the state and contemporary statebuilding. This article examines that contribution by way of the dialectic between Weberian and Durkheimian approaches to the state-a dialogue between two founding fathers of sociology that is one of the cornerstones of the Badiean approach to international relations. Using an analytic framework based on Badian's work on statebuilding, this article attempts to demonstrate how the latter can be rooted either in Durhkeimian questions of social cohesion (the "social legitimacy" approach) or neo Weberian questions of state capacity (the "institutional" approach). This article also explores the limits of the neo-Weberian approach while noting the complexity of putting a Durkheimian approach into practice.

Abstract: The usual arguments for decentralization by its advocates are that it can achieve accountability, transparency, participation and democracy. In reaching these goals, however, proponents of decentralization reform have articulated concerns about whether government officials have sufficient capacity to implement decentralization policies, particularly at local level. This article asserts that in Cambodia, where decentralization has unfolded gradually since its adoption some 15years ago, lack of capacity is not the main problem. Decentralization is designed and implemented as part of the ruling political party's strategy to strengthen its grip at the sub-national level rather than as an exercise for improving accountability and democracy. Although decentralization is unlikely to lead to democratic gains, it does provide an opportunity for the rejuvenation of a patronage-based party in ways that could increase state capacity and improve development outcomes.

Abstract: Although environmental flow regime assessments are becoming increasingly holistic, they rarely provoke water managers to enact the adaptive water reallocation mechanisms required to secure environmental water for wetlands. The conditions that cause science-based environmental flow assessments to succeed or fail in informing the management of environmental water requirements remain unclear. To begin to resolve these conditions, we used process tracing to deconstruct the sequence of activities required to manage environmental water in four case studies of seasonally ponding wetlands in Mediterranean and Mesoamerican watersheds. We hypothesized that, when the flexibility and equitability of the socioeconomic system do not match the complexity of the biophysical system, this leads to a failure of managers to integrate scientific guidance in their allocation of environmental water. Diagnostic evidence gathered indicates that science-management partnerships are essential to align institutional flexibility and socioeconomic equitability with the system's ecohydrological complexity, and thus move from determination to reallocation of environmental water. These results confirm that institutions e.g., river basin organizations need to be supplemented by motivated actors with experience and skill to negotiate allocation and adaptive management of environmental water. These institutional-actor synergies are likely to be especially important in water scarce regions when the need to accommodate extreme hydrological conditions is not met by national governance capacity. We conclude by focusing on benefit sharing as a means to better describe the conditions for successful science-based environmental flow assessments that realize productive efficiency in environmental water allocation i.e., recognition of multiple values for both people and ecosystems.

Abstract: What determines cross-national variations in the extent of anti-government protests in Asia? Anti-government protests have surged across Asia in recent years, with many contributing to consequential political change. However, systematic cross-national comparison of the determinants of protests in Asia is still largely missing. This article fills this important gap by quantitatively examining the explanatory power of the three main theories of contentious politics-grievance, resource mobilization, and political process theories-in the Asian context with new data on anti-government protests in all 25 Asian states from 1990 to 2016. The analysis finds that urbanization, information and communication technology, and regional demonstration effects are the strong catalysts of anti-government protests in Asia, while repressive state capacity particularly dampens protests. The findings offer important insights into the dynamics of the anti-government protests that have become increasingly salient in Asian politics.

Abstract: Although climate change has been recognized as a "threat multiplier," its specific effects on conflict-affected areas remain underexplored. This study investigates the nexus between climate change and violent conflict within the "fragile geography" of Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province. Balochistan's increasingly fragmented security landscape and recurring natural disasters, notably the 2022 floods, provide a pertinent background for examining the interplay between climate change and violent conflict. A qualitative approach was employed, whereby interviews and group discussions were conducted in two Balochistan districts. The analysis revealed that weak institutional capacity, deep-rooted socioeconomic and political inequalities, and notably, "migration patterns" are critical variables influencing the dynamic interplay between climate change and violent conflict in the region. By analyzing the vulnerabilities inherent in Balochistan's diverse physiography, this study illuminates how climate change exacerbates violent conflict in a region already beset by instability, highlighting the urgent need for a more nuanced understanding to address these complex challenges.

Abstract: Veliger larvae of giant clams are demonstrable planktotrophs and provision of a particulate food source is generally accepted to improve hatchery production. However, the appropriateness of continuing to administer particulate food after larvae settle and develop as pediveligers is unclear. This study evaluated whether larval (age and size) and microalgal (species and cell density) factors influenced the capacity for pediveligers of Tridacna noae to ingest and digest cells from commercially available microalgae concentrates. Pediveligers at 6 and 10-days post-fertilisation were offered one of four microalgae species (Isochrysis sp., Pavlova sp., Tetraselmis sp., Thalassiosira weissflogii) at two cell densities (4000 and 8000 cells mL(-1)) and subsequently examined using epifluorescence microscopy. The appropriateness of continuing to administer microalgae as a food source was found to diminish as pediveligers approached metamorphosis, with negligible ingestion occurring at 10-days post-fertilisation. Earlier in development, at 6-days post-fertilisation, ingestion was significantly influenced by larval size, microalgae species, and microalgae cell density. Considering capacity for both ingestion and digestion, the Isochrysis sp. and Tetraselmis sp. microalgae concentrates had the greatest potential as a particulate food source for pediveligers of T. noae. The results of this study provide a basis for further refinement of giant clam hatchery procedures utilising microalgae concentrates as a larval food source.

Abstract: Government capacity and performance determine rise and fall of the country, as well as vital interests of all citizens. And it is these workers for government, government employees that have performed all kinds of government functions and organized various activities. Entering 21(st) century, New Public Service Theory was proposed, providing a set of valuable system and target model for administrative reforms, especially for the construction of service-oriented governments in many countries. Currently, China is endeavoring to construct a service-oriented government. Chinese citizens expect the government to function as a service provider, offering safeguard and service for legal activities to promote social progress. So it is of great significance to raise public satisfaction. And for above reasons, it is a necessity to probe into job satisfaction of government employees and public satisfaction. We should improve government employee management system based on "people-centered" principle, respect individual value and raise job satisfaction of government employees. Meanwhile, we should also strive for establishing Public Service Pledge System, conducting dynamic evaluation on the performance of government employees based on public satisfaction, and introducing government employee competition mechanism to raise public satisfaction.

Abstract: Disaster management planning is carried out widely around the world in different ways in developing and developed countries, but the implementation of such plans experiences challenges even in developed countries. This issue is discussed in the case of Bangladesh, a highly disaster-prone country where there is a strong institutional setup for disaster management. The National Plan for Disaster Management (NPDM 2016-2020) of Bangladesh was prepared by the author for the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and it is aligned with international frameworks including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). The plan's development process was inclusive, involving extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. While the planning process and the product itself were rigorous, its promulgation in terms of translating into implementation, institutional capacity building and uptake at different levels remains uncertain. While the plan has some key strengths, a number of constraints impede translation of the plan into action. Given Bangladesh's recent economic growth and progress in reducing disaster risk, there is the opportunity to implement NPDM 2016-2020, but this has gone unrealised, pointing to the need for a review that can identify how disaster management planning and implementation can flow seamlessly.

Abstract: Context or problem: Phenotyping is an integral part of plant breeding operations. In many cases the trait measured is not identical to the target trait for reasons of speed and or cost. This is a form of indirect selection, where correlation between the trait measured and the target phenotype influences the rate of genetic gain. Low correlations lead to slow rates of genetic gain. In sub-Saharan African maize breeding programs, maize grain yield in breeding experimental plots is measured as a field weight (FW), which includes the grain and cob. The weight of grain from each plot is estimated as a standard proportion of grain to total ear weight using a shelling percentage of 80 %. This approach assumes that there is no genetic, environment or genetic by environment interaction in shelling percentage which, if present, would contribute to slower rates of genetic gain for grain yield. Objective or research question: This study investigated the magnitude of genetic and environmental variation in shelling percentage and its impact on selection in six hybrid maize multi -environment yield trials in Ethiopia over two seasons. Methods: The data of shelled grain weight (SW) and cob weight (CW) from the trials were analyzed using a bivariate linear mixed model. Results: Genetic variances for both traits varied across the six testing sites ranging from 0.199 to 2.975 for SW and from 0.029 to 0.245 for CW. The genetic correlations between pairs of sites for SW and CW also varied, indicating the existence of genotype by environment interaction for these traits. Additionally, the bivariate regressions between FW and SW indicated there was substantial genetic deviation around the 80 % shelling response, and this relationship was impacted by environmental influences. Conclusion: The use of a constant relationship of 80 % shelling biases grain yield prediction in multi -environment hybrid maize yield trials and thus reduces the rate of genetic gain in maize breeding programs. Implications or significance: Taking into account the variations in the shelling percentage of the genotypes across sites in predicting grain yield from field weight improves the accuracy of genotype selection and the rate of genetic gain in maize breeding programs.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of two national-level studies of REDD+ governance values in Nepal and Papua New Guinea (PNG), using a hierarchical framework of principles, criteria, and indicators (PC&I), with evaluation at the indicator level. The research was conducted by means of an online survey to determine general perspectives on the governance quality of REDD+, as well as stakeholder workshops, in which participants were asked to rank indicators on the basis of perceived national significance. In the online survey, respondents in both countries identified inclusiveness and resources as the highest and lowest scoring governance values, while inclusiveness, resources, accountability, and transparency, were given priority, although their relative importance differed between countries given national circumstances. The reasons for the commonalities and differences of perceptions between these countries are discussed. The findings suggest that while a generic set of governance values may be usefully applied for determining the institutional legitimacy of REDD+, their relative importance is different. This leads to the conclusion that it may not be appropriate to use a simplified approach to REDD+ governance, focusing for example on safeguards, given different national priorities and contexts.

Abstract: This paper explains cross-market variations in the degree of return predictability using the extreme bounds analysis (EBA). The EBA addresses model uncertainty in identifying robust determinant(s) of cross-sectional return predictability. Additionally, the paper develops two profitable trading strategies based on return predictability evidence. The result reveals that among the 13 determinants of the cross-sectional variation of return predictability, only value of stock traded (a measure of liquidity) is found to have robust explanatory power by Leamer's (1985) EBA. However, Sala-i-Martin's (1997) EBA reports that value of stock traded, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, level of information and communication technology (ICT) development, governance quality, and corruption perception are robust determinants. We further find that a strategy of buying (selling) aggregate market portfolios of the countries with the highest positive (negative) return predictability statistic in the past 24 months generates statistically significant positive returns in the subsequent 3 to 12 months. In the individual country level, a trading rule of buying (selling) the respective country's aggregate market portfolio, when the return predictability statistic turns out positive (negative), outperforms the conventional buy-and-hold strategy for many countries.

Abstract: In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters. Some of the world's most earthquake-prone zones are also areas of high population density. The impact is magnified by vulnerability factors including non-enforcement of building codes, knowledge gaps, urban poverty and poor governance capacity to manage and reduce earthquake risks. Poor security of land tenure and property rights increases the vulnerability of people and affects their ability to respond to natural disasters. Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.

Abstract: Incrementalism is a mode of self-help and continuing practice that is prevalent primarily in the Global South. It enables owner-builders to meet housing needs typically over an extended period of time as they can more conveniently manage the required resources. While (informal) tenure, materiality, and housing conditions have long been the focus of incremental housing scholarship, researchers are increasingly recognising the value of incrementalism's metabolic interplay with broader urban processes. This paper complements these later works by qualitatively examining four dominant incremental housing pathways in the urban fringes of Khulna, Bangladesh: absentee landholding, makeshift sheltering, speculative land disposal and informal brokerage. Empirical evidence suggests that a variety of actors, primarily motivated by land speculation, participate in these incremental housing pathways. While the implementation of the official plan for Khulna's peri-urban areas is delayed, I argue that these actors coproduce a complex housing market as well as a self-help city in which urban institutions play more passive and reactionary roles. The findings contribute to rethinking the self-organising logic of urban expansion in many Southern cities, which is often centred on urban land at the crossroads of institutional capacity deficit, speculative housing demand and supply, and informal-formal hybridity.

Abstract: Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly transmissible infectious disease killing millions of people yearly, particularly in low-income countries. TB is most likely to be transmitted in healthcare settings with poor infection control practices. Implementing TB infection prevention and control (TB-IPC) is pivotal to preventing TB transmission in healthcare settings. This study investigated diverse stakeholders' perspectives relating to barriers and strategies for TB-IPC in rural hospitals in Papua New Guinea.Methods Multiple qualitative case studies were conducted with 32 key stakeholders with experience in TB services. Data collection drew on three primary sources to triangulate data: semi-structured interviews, document reviews and field notes. The data were analyzed using hybrid deductive-inductive thematic analysis.Results Our results reveal that key stakeholders perceive multiple interdependent factors that affect TB-IPC practice. The key emerging themes include strategic planning for and prioritizing TB-IPC guidelines; governance, leadership and accountability at the provincial level; community attitudes towards TB control; institutional capacity to deliver TB care, healthcare workers' safety, and long-term partnership and integration of TB-IPC programmes into the broad IPC programme.Conclusions The evidence suggests that a multi-perspective approach is crucial for TB-IPC guidelines in healthcare institutions. Interventions focusing on addressing health systems strengthening may improve the implementation of TB-IPC guidelines.

Abstract: This paper investigates the views of multi-stakeholders on the governance quality of existing forest management strategies for red panda (Ailurus fulgens) protection in Nepal, focusing on forest governance in general, red panda conservation programmes and natural habitat protection in particular. The study deployed two surveys in August and September 2020. The first survey was conducted online for the stakeholders with internet access; for those without, it was conducted over the phone. While the results reveal almost similar perspectives among the stakeholders regarding the effectiveness of the red panda management approaches, they differ significantly between the online survey and telephonic survey, in terms of the relative scores given to these initiatives. In depth, follow-up interviews revealed that marginalised groups had little access to income generation from conservation activities and few capacity-building opportunities. These findings indicate that while management strategies for red panda conservation were generally considered effective by online survey participants which are generally more privileged, this is less effective for marginalised people. Local people, who are typically resource-poor and reliant on the forest, continue to endure inequitable resource distribution and benefit sharing. Consequently, greater attention should be paid to balancing the conservation needs and basic needs of forest-dependent communities through capacity building, income generation and alternative sources of livelihood.

Abstract: After decades of military rule, internal conflict, and international isolation, Myanmar has embarked on a course of institution building. In light of Myanmar's low rating on the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (World Bank Group), the nation faces an enormous challenge in developing public institutions that meet its needs and expectations. This challenge includes development of institutional capacity that will allow Myanmar to participate in international economic affairs. A step in this direction involves the creation of a securities exchange market mechanism. The current study considers the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Myanmar (SECM) to support securities regulation. It applies a novel organization level of analysis strategy that considers SECM as a 'pocket of effectiveness' (POE) in the context of a low-performing public institutional setting in terms of the good governance criteria of responsiveness, accountability, and transparency (RAT). While the study finds evidence of progress in building Myanmar's securities regulation, it also finds limits in RAT development that challenges the SECM's potential designation as a 'POE'. Based on feedback from proximate stakeholders in the daily work of the SECM, recommendations are offered for revised policies and practices in order to resolve them.

Abstract: Financial sector development is a multidimensional process that plays a vital role in the economic growth and development of a country. This study investigates the effect of institutional quality on multidimensional financial sector development, and its dimensions, such as, depth, access, and efficiency. We used a panel dataset of 85 emerging and developing economies from 1996 to 2018 for analysis. Our findings based on 2SLS estimation demonstrate that institutional quality has a significant positive effect on the progress of the financial sector, especially its depth, access, and efficiency. The breakdown analysis shows that most of the key components (control of corrup-tion, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and accountability) of institutional quality enhance the financial sector development. Our empirical results are robust across alternative measures of institutional quality, split-sample analysis, alternative instrument, and estimator.

Abstract: Party politics in Indonesia's current democratic regime takes place within the parameters of a heavily fragmented multi-party system. Factionalism exists in most parties, but the influence of factions on internal party dynamics is only weak to moderate. Where factions exist, they are usually driven by clientelism and patronage rather than the representation of social cleavages, ideological differences, or regional affiliations, although traces of programmatically infused factionalism do persist in some parties. The intensity of factional conflicts in Indonesia's young democracy has varied significantly over time and across different parties. While temporal variations are mostly related to changing institutional incentive structures, disparities between individual parties can be attributed to different organisational histories and structures as well as divergent levels of rootedness in social cleavage structures. It is noteworthy that several Indonesian parties have relatively deep roots in society and, in some cases, close links to long-established civil society organisations that preceded party formation. Given these constraints on more severe factionalism, damaging effects on governance have been fairly limited. The most debilitating effects of factionalism have been felt within the parties themselves, whereas government effectiveness and coalition formation has, ironically, sometimes benefitted from factional disputes.

Abstract: In recent years, China's central government has begun to articulate its adaptation policy and to identify measures to adapt the nation's agriculture to changing precipitation patterns, higher temperatures, and extreme events. These developments are occurring at a time when the agricultural sector is in flux: while the major grain cropsrice, wheat, and cornare still central to food security, many smallholder farmers have shifted away from land-intensive production to growing higher-value, labour-intensive horticultural products, such as fruit and vegetables. In addition, new forms of agriculture are emerging because of out-migration and land transfers. This review introduces the adaptation policy context for agricultural adaptation in China and reviews existing research on impacts and adaptation. It then discusses how well existing research and policy actually reflect the challenges of adapting China's farms to climate change. Four issues are discussed which together suggest that current science and policy very poorly reflect challenges on the ground: the framing of agriculture as a relatively homogeneous sector; the absence of any vulnerability assessments attuned to local contexts; a bias toward large-scale engineering solutions; and insufficient consideration of local government capacity.

Abstract: Fisheries provide nutrition and livelihoods for coastal populations, but many fisheries are fully or over-exploited and we lack an approach for analysing which factors affect management tool performance. We conducted a literature review of 390 studies to assess how fisheries characteristics affected management tool performance across both small-scale and large-scale fisheries. We defined success as increased or maintained abundance or biomass, reductions in fishing mortality or improvements in population status. Because the literature only covered a narrow set of biological factors, we also conducted an expert elicitation to create a typology of broader fishery characteristics, enabling conditions and design considerations that affect performance. The literature suggested that the most commonly used management tool in a region was often the most successful, although the scale of success varied. Management tools were more often deemed successful when used in combination, particularly pairings of tools that controlled fishing mortality or effort with spatial management. Examples of successful combinations were the use of catch limits with quotas and limited entry, and marine protected areas with effort restrictions. The most common factors associated with inadequate biological performance were structural' issues, including poor design or implementation. The expert-derived typologies revealed strong local leadership, high community involvement and governance capacity as common factors of success across management tool categories (i.e. input, output and technical measures), but the degree of importance varied. Our results are designed to inform selection of appropriate management tools based on empirical data and experience to increase the likelihood of successful fisheries management.

Abstract: In recent years, growing water insecurity in the Himalayan region has attracted new scientific research and fresh attention on policy. In this paper, we synthesize field research evidence from a sample of five Himalayan cities three in Nepal and two in the western Indian Himalayas on various forms of water insecurity and cities' responses to such challenges. We gathered evidence from a field research conducted in these cities between 2014 and 2018. We show how different types of Himalayan towns (mainly hilltop, foot hill, river side, touristic, and regional trading hub) are struggling to secure water for their residents and tourists, as well as for the wider urban economy. We found that even though the region receives significant amounts of precipitation in the form of snow and rainfall, it is facing increasing levels of water insecurity. Four of the five towns we studied are struggling to develop well-performing local institutions to manage water supply. Worse still, none of the cities have a robust system of water planning and governance to tackle the water challenges emerging from rapid urbanization and climate change. In the absence of a coordinated water planning agency, a complex mix of government, community, and private systems of water supply has emerged in the Himalayan towns across both Nepal and India. There is clearly a need for strengthening local governance capacity as well as down-scaling climate science to inform water planning at the city level.

Abstract: This paper traces the logic, goals and changed socio-ecological relations and water norms introduced by donorand state-led drinking water supply schemes to small urbanising settlements across the lower Himalayas of India and Nepal. While urban development and water planning tend to boundarise needs and interventions to city limits and city-dwellers, we adopt a hydro-social lens to trace the impacts and consequences of infrastructure and water as both travel through the landscape. Investments into water supply introduce new scales, spatialities and visions for urban development that actively peripheralise rural needs and interests, and introduce new dependencies for infrastructural maintenance that stretch the institutional and governance capacity of towns, such as around energy, finance, and expertise. We fmd that water supply projects give rise to new power differentials and development trajectories between more-powerful, typically urban and down-stream communities, and rural, up-stream source regions. Projects bring new potentials but also disrupt old relations and customs around water, resulting in the emergence of conflicts within and beyond towns as water availability and access opportunities change. Application of a hydro-social and urban metabolism focus to Himalayan waterscapes makes visible the environmental and societal trade-offs associated with resource provisioning to urban development centres.

Abstract: Fisheries stock assessments are essential for science-based fisheries management. Inland fisheries pose challenges, but also provide opportunities for biological assessments that differ from those encountered in large marine fisheries for which many of our assessment methods have been developed. These include the number and diversity of fisheries, high levels of ecological and environmental variation, and relative lack of institutional capacity for assessment. In addition, anthropogenic impacts on habitats, widespread presence of non-native species and the frequent use of enhancement and restoration measures such as stocking affect stock dynamics. This paper outlines various stock assessment and data collection approaches that can be adapted to a wide range of different inland fisheries and management challenges. Although this paper identifies challenges in assessment, it focuses on solutions that are practical, scalable and transferrable. A path forward is suggested in which biological assessment generates some of the critical information needed by fisheries managers to make effective decisions that benefit the resource and stakeholders.

Abstract: Identifying the robust determinants of corruption among cultural, economic, institutional, and geographical factors has proven difficult. From a policy perspective, it is important to know whether inherent, largely unchangeable attributes are responsible or if institutional and economic attributes are at work. Accounting for model uncertainty, we use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to analyze a comprehensive list of 36 potential corruption determinants across 123 countries (covering 87 percent of the world population). The BMA methodology sorts through all 68,719,476,736 possible model combinations (2(36)) in order to carve out the robust correlates. We then take a step toward alleviating endogeneity concerns in an Instrumental Variable BMA framework. Our results indicate that cultural factors are largely irrelevant, whereas particular economic and institutional characteristics matter. The rule of law emerges as the most persistent predictor with a posterior inclusion probability (PIP) in the true model of 1.00, whereas we find strong evidence for government effectiveness (PIP of 0.88), urbanization (0.85), and the share of women in parliament (0.80) as meaningful determinants of lower corruption levels. In developing countries, the extent of primary schooling enters as a powerful factor with a PIP of 1.00. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study has the objective of examining how internal corporate governance mechanisms are related to earnings manipulation, measured by real-based earnings manipulation (REM) and accrual-based earnings manipulation (AEM). The internal corporate governance mechanisms discussed in this study signify two main kinds of board characteristics (board size and board independence) and three main kinds of ownership structure (institutional ownership, foreign ownership and business group affiliation). The study models were examined from eight countries selected from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. A total of 480 non-financial firms listed between 2012 and 2019 were examined. Based on panel data-based generalised methods of moments (GMM) estimation, the findings showed that institutional ownership in MENA nations limits the use of REM and AEM. Additionally, we found that larger boards are more likely to participate in REM practices. Board independence has a positive association with REM and AEM. The results also reveal that business group affiliation has a significant effect on both methods of earnings manipulation. Foreign ownership does not seem to significantly impact either of the two manipulation methods. Finally, these results help regulators and policymakers pursue reforms to enhance national governance quality in the MENA region.

Abstract: The concept of adaptive capacity is increasingly being applied to understand and predict people's ability to adapt to the emerging impacts of climate change. Despite its potential utility, the degree to which adaptive capacity is a reliable predictor of adaptation remains unclear; evidence for a causal relationship is insufficient and conflicting. To address this gap, we surveyed 231 reef tourism companies across eight countries in the Asia-Pacific that have been affected by severe climate disturbances between 2014 and 2019. We used a combination of descriptive and multivariate statistical approaches to explore the relationships between adaptive capacity, adaptive responses, and contextual conditions. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive operationalization of actor-specific adaptive capacity is not necessarily a reliable proxy for measuring potential adaptation to future climate change. The severity of impacts on individual operators was the major determinant of adaptive action. Adaptive action might therefore be adopted autonomously by the majority of microeconomic actors (when they are severely affected), irrespective of their a priori adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity was, however, a reliable proxy for the likelihood that an operator would take transformative action as their primary response to a climate disturbance; several of our indicators of adaptive capacity had a meaningful effect size, in particular those within the adaptive capacity domain of social organization. Policies focused on improving coordination and collaboration between industry, research, and government actors might therefore be more effective than alternatives in promoting long-term transformation of social-ecological systems. Adaptation confidence and government effectiveness were barriers to transformative action, and we provide some potential explanations. Further empirical research is needed to evaluate the generality of our findings in different contexts over space and time.

Abstract: This study explores the synergistic causal effects of remittance inflows, urbanization, and quality of governance on multidimensional food security in Pakistan using large-scale time-series data over the period of 1973-2019. We use a broad-spectrum approach to empirically estimate temporal symmetrical relationships. The analysis revealed that utilization of worker's remittance has a significant negative impact on multidimensional food security but not on food access. Urbanization growth was also found to be negative and had a significant effect on all dimensions of food security. On the other hand, we found an overall positive relationship of governance quality, agricultural share to GDP, and government development expenditures for food availability, access, utilization, and stability. The empirical analysis suggests that utilization of remittances in a developing country such as Pakistan has the potential to negatively influence food security by decreasing the area of cropland because of non-agricultural-induced investment. To deal with this problem, scholars should collaborate across multi-disciplinary boundaries and leverage the advantages of multidimensional research design to study the effects of capital inflows and various dimensions of food security. As policymakers and researchers become aware of these complex relationships, more can be done to understand the opportunities and risks for national, household, and individual food security and sustainable development.

Abstract: The notion that economic reform can reduce corruption remains prevalent in the policy agenda of international financial institutions, especially of the World Bank. Economic reforms have, therefore, been carried out throughout various parts of the world to improve the performance of the economies. Using data from 94 low- and middle-income nations for the period 1996-2015, this study employs static and dynamic panel analysis to examine whether economic reform undertaken in accordance with the World Bank's reform programs negatively affects corruption. Our findings suggest that enhancing government effectiveness (i.e. independence of civil service from political pressure, provision of quality public services, effective policy formulation and the government's commitment to such policies) and improving public rights and civil liberties could be some of the most promising policies in terms of fighting corruption. The role of economic development and growth in real per capita income is also found to be significant in some of the specifications. However, the assertion that economic reform can reduce corruption is rejected in all the specifications. We rather find evidence that economic reforms negatively affect the ability of democracy to fight corruption, although on a slim margin. The central theme of the implications of our findings is that in combating corruption, social, institutional and legal means are far more important than economic means. The finding thus is compatible with the World Bank's effort in the later years to introduce governance and democracy as effective tool against corruption.

Abstract: We applied social network analysis to pig trader networks on the Kenya-Uganda border. Social network analysis is a recently developed tool, which is useful for understanding value chains and improving disease control policies. We interviewed a sample of 33 traders about their experiences with trade and African swine fever (ASF), analyzed the networks they generated in purchasing pigs and selling pork and their potential contribution to modulating dissemination of the ASF virus (ASFV). The majority of the traders were aware of clinical signs of ASF and the risk of trade transmitting ASFV. Most said they avoided buying pigs from ASF outbreak villages or sick pigs but their experiences also indicated that inadvertent purchase was relatively common. Traders had early knowledge of outbreaks since they were contacted by farmers who had heard rumours and wanted to sell their pigs to avoid the risk of them dying. Individual traders bought pigs in up to nine villages, and up to six traders operated in a village. Although each trade typically spanned less than 5 km, networks of the various traders, comprising movements of pigs from source villages to slaughter slabs/sites and retail outlets, and movement of pork to villages where it was consumed, linked up indirectly across the 100 km x 50 km study area and revealed several trade pathways across the Kenya-Uganda border. ASF could potentially spread across this area and beyond through sequential pig and pork transactions. Regulation of the pig and pork trade was minimal in practice. The risk of ASFV being spread by traders was compounded by their use of poorly constructed slaughter slabs/sites with open drainage, ineffective or non-existent meat inspection services, lack of provision for biosecurity in the value chain, and sales of pork to customers who were unaware of the risks to their own pigs from contact with ASF infected pork. More effective regulation is warranted. However, limitations on government capacity, together with the strong self-interest that established traders have in reducing the disruption and financial losses that outbreaks cause, highlight the importance of governments and traders co-developing an approach to ASF control. Formation of trader organizations or common interest groups warrants government support as an important step in engaging traders in developing and implementing effective approaches to reduce the risk of ASF outbreaks.

The trade-offs between different criteria should be the focus of more rigorous and quantitative marginal analysis, identifying the extent to which improving a given criterion worsens another. The existence, causes and consequences of underbidding, the implications of the just energy transition for the performance of auctions and auction design, the marginal impact of the level of design elements and the interactions between design element choices in "design element packages" merit more attention. There should be a greater focus on the micro-level in the assessment of the success of auctions and auction design. At a methodological level, assessments of auctions with case studies should coexist with more quantitative studies on the topic, using a wide range of methodologies. However, the transferability of lessons on the functioning of design elements across different contexts will be necessarily limited. Finally, a plea is made to national governments and international institutions to facilitate the access to auction data.

Abstract: This study provides a first evaluation of different hatchery culture methods for the giant clam Tridacna noae. Three culture methods (intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive) using two tank designs (60 L and 277 L) were successful in producing 30-day old T. noae juveniles. There was no statistically significant interaction between tank design and culture method when considering cumulative survival (P = 0.89) or antero-posterior growth (P = 0.20), and the two tank designs did not influence cumulative survival (P = 0.78) or antero-posterior growth (P = 0.81). Differences in cumulative survival among the extensive (0.027 +/- 0.015%), semi-intensive (0.005 +/- 0.002%), and intensive (0.004 +/- 0.001%) culture methods were non-significant (P = 0.11). The mean antero-posterior measurements at 30 days post-fertilisation among intensive (583.57 +/- 12.71 mu m), semi-intensive (530.92 +/- 11.02 mu m), and extensive methods (541.67 +/- 10.95 mu m), were also non-significant (P = 0.05). Further analysis of survival among different developmental stages identified significantly greater survival of T. noae between the pediveliger and juvenile development stages within the extensive culture method. Our results show that extensive culture methods can achieve comparable hatchery production of T. noae to semi-intensive and intensive culture methods, which require additional managerial, infrastructural, and nutritional inputs.

Abstract: Protected areas have been gazetted to protect natural resources and biodiversity, but evaluations of effectiveness rarely include measures of species population change. We compiled annual site-level spending and elephant population data for 102 protected areas conserving either savannah (Loxodonta africana) or forest (Loxodonta cyclotis) elephants, which showed a median annual population decline of -0.78% across the protected areas. Site-level population change was strongly associated with funding and government effectiveness. Annual funding deficits occurred in 78% of the protected areas, and when comparing necessary levels of annual spend to stabilize elephant populations, we estimate a US$1.5 billion annual funding deficit across all the protected areas. While financial investment can improve elephant conservation outcomes, there is still a need to identify where and how to best finance elephant poaching interventions, requiring a global commitment to improve the socioeconomic impacts of protected areas on local communities and reduce ivory demand.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to extend the New Public Financial Management concept and the contingency model approach to an analysis of the determinants of the accrual-based International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) adoption process as a financial management reform in Sri Lanka, a developing country in Asia. Design/methodology/approach Based on the prior literature, this paper develops a framework to highlight the importance of accrual-based reforms in public sector accounting policies to enable better transparency and accountability. It shows the extent to which Sri Lankan public sector institutions have adopted IPSAS-based accounting standards and the limitations of adopting these standards in a developing country, using documentary analysis. Findings In developing countries, the public sector faces practical problems when adopting reforms due to limited institutional capacity, high political involvement and bureaucracy in decision making. This paper concludes that significant policy changes towards the adoption of international accounting standards have gained momentum over the last decade in Sri Lanka while the much larger economies in Asia are still studying this process. However, the prevailing political uncertainty in Sri Lanka has negatively impacted the implementation process. Originality/value Relatively little is known about the diffusion of, and the difficulties in, implementing accrual-based IPSAS in the Asian region. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by exploring the Sri Lankan experience. This could be applied by other developing countries in Asia, including the high-growth nations, for policy adoption and accounting harmonisation.

Abstract: Critical feminist reviews of gender mainstreaming suggest a widespread disillusionment with gender and development. The literature has been dominated, however, by accounts of gender mainstreaming in international development institutions and in Western countries. There is a shortage of studies on how developing countries conceptualize, design and manage gender mainstreaming in development policies and programs in specific political and economic contexts. This paper focuses on Indonesia which made gender mainstreaming a national policy while battling the impacts of the Asian economic crisis and experiencing a political transition from authoritarianism to democracy. This strategic moment created some opportunities and challenges for government, NGO, and international gender and development advocates to integrate gender into the national poverty reduction policy. An analysis of the policy drafts and interviews with key players in the policy process shows that gender expertise, institutional capacity, organizational resistance, and leadership at the national level were important factors. Broader political concerns such as the diminished standing of World Bank and the IMF in post-crisis Indonesia also played a role in the long-winded policy process that produced the Indonesia's National Poverty Reduction Strategy. One important lesson drawn from this case study is the need to indigenize gender mainstreaming, by building gender analysis capabilities in national women's machineries and forging stronger links with national and local gender-concerned NGOs and research institutions. Secondly, translating gender-aware poverty reduction policies into gender-responsive action remains a great challenge not only in Indonesia but elsewhere due to paucity of relevant gender-disaggregated data.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the extensive use of bans (temporary prohibitions or moratoriums) on resource exploitation activities by the government of Laos as an authoritarian environmental governance tool. We focus on bans enacted recently in three sectors: on the granting of land concessions in 2012, on the expansion of banana plantations in 2014, and on logging exports in 2016. Bans have long been used in Laos, particularly in the forestry sector, despite their considerable political risk and economic costs, the way they contradict state actors' promotion of these same activities as drivers of development, and their past ineffectiveness. Most cases in the environmental authoritarian literature explore authoritarian states with a strong capacity to employ top-down governance tools. We argue, in contrast, that the Lao government's repeated use of bans instead of other effective governing tools, such as more incremental, conditional, or incentive-based policies, reflects not strong state capacity but rather the limits to its implementing and enforcement capacity. The bans examined emerge from central-local divides, unregulated village land leasing, and failures to extract state revenues, and we interpret them as central-state efforts to consolidate and assert a more centralized, command-and-control authority over the country's land and resources.

Abstract: In the current stage of urbanization in China, urban construction has gradually shifted from incremental construction dominated by real estate to stock transformation based on improving urban quality. The evaluation of urban renewal projects is crucial for decision-making and resource allocation. However, there is no consensus on the evaluation indicators and methods. This study evaluates the current status of urban quality using the MABAC method based on numerical indicators. It evaluates the improvement of urban quality using the VIKOR method based on public satisfaction indicators. It is found that the comprehensive weights and subjective weights of the five first-level indicators in the evaluation index system of urban quality improvement in Shandong Province, namely blue-green space improvement, air cleanliness improvement, road traffic improvement, life service improvement, and governance capacity improvement, are quite different. The weight distribution of these indicators needs to be adjusted and optimized, especially for improving living services, as well as secondary indicators such as black and odorous water treatment, urban clean heating, the number of public vehicles per 10,000 people in the city, the 15 min living circle, the renovation of old residential areas, and the construction of urban intelligent management platforms. Based on the comprehensive evaluation results, an attempt is made to propose a more scientific evaluation index system, providing valuable references for urban renewal management.

Abstract: Background: Little is known about the influence of the site of research or publication on the impact of the research findings on clinical practice, particularly in developing countries. The International Clinical Epidemiology Network ( INCLEN) is dedicated to improving the quality of health research in the Developing World through institutional capacity building for evidence based medicine, and provided the opportunity to examine the likely impact of research location and journal location on physicians' practice in a number of the participating countries. Methods: Physicians from secondary and tertiary hospitals in six cities located in China, Thailand, India, Egypt and Kenya were enrolled in a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The primary outcome measures were scores on a Likert scale reflecting stated likelihood of changing clinical practice depending on the source of the research or its publication. Results: Overall, local research and publications were most likely to effect change in clinical practice, followed by North American, European and regional research/publications respectively, although there were significant variations between countries. The impact of local and regional research would be greater if the perceived research quality improved in those settings. Conclusion: Conducting high quality local research is likely to be an effective way of getting research findings into practice in developing countries.

Abstract: There is now widespread acceptance of the universal coverage approach, presented in the 2010 World Health Report. There are more and more voices for the benefit of creating a single national risk pool. Now, a body of literature is emerging on institutional design and organizational practice for universal coverage, related to management of the three health-financing functions: collection, pooling and purchasing. While all countries can move towards universal coverage, lower-income countries face particular challenges, including scarce resources and limited capacity. Recently, the Lao PDR has been preparing options for moving to a single national health insurance scheme. The aim is to combine four different social health protection schemes into a national health insurance authority (NHIA) with a single national fund- and risk-pool. This paper investigates the main institutional and organizational challenges related to the creation of the NHIA. The paper uses a qualitative approach, drawing on the World Health Organization's institutional and Organizational Assessment for Improving and Strengthening health financing (OASIS) conceptual framework for data analysis. Data were collected from a review of key health financing policy documents and from 17 semi-structured key informant interviews. Policy makers and advisors are confronting issues related to institutional arrangements, funding sources for the authority and government support for subsidies to the demand-side health financing schemes. Compulsory membership is proposed, but the means for covering the informal sector have not been resolved. While unification of existing schemes may be the basis for creating a single risk pool, challenges related to administrative capacity and cross-subsidies remain. The example of Lao PDR illustrates the need to include consideration of national context, the sequencing of reforms and the time-scale appropriate for achieving universal coverage.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Navigating Climate Adaptation on Public Lands: How Views on Ecosystem Change and Scale Interact with Management Approaches

Abstract: Managers are increasingly being asked to integrate climate change adaptation into public land management. The literature discusses a range of adaptation approaches, including managing for resistance, resilience, and transformation; but many strategies have not yet been widely tested. This study employed in-depth interviews and scenario-based focus groups in the Upper Gunnison Basin in Colorado to learn how public land managers envision future ecosystem change, and how they plan to utilize different management approaches in the context of climate adaptation. While many managers evoked the past in thinking about projected climate impacts and potential responses, most managers in this study acknowledged and even embraced (if reluctantly) that many ecosystems will experience regime shifts in the face of climate change. However, accepting that future ecosystems will be different from past ecosystems led managers in different directions regarding how to respond and the appropriate role of management intervention. Some felt management actions should assist and even guide ecosystems toward future conditions. Others were less confident in projections and argued against transformation. Finally, some suggested that resilience could provide a middle path, allowing managers to help ecosystems adapt to change without predicting future ecosystem states. Scalar challenges and institutional constraints also influenced how managers thought about adaptation. Lack of institutional capacity was believed to constrain adaptation at larger scales. Resistance, in particular, was considered impractical at almost any scale due to institutional constraints. Managers negotiated scalar challenges and institutional constraints by nesting different approaches both spatially and temporally.

Abstract: Globally, rural areas suffer from less infrastructure relative to urban areas. Political and development economists have mainly attributed this disparity in infrastructure distribution to governance. The literature has sufficiently discussed the role that rural-urban infrastructure inequality plays in development outcomes such as poverty. However, not much is known about the effect of the rural-urban infrastructure gap on the environment. To contribute to knowledge and policy discussions, we investigate the impact of rural-urban energy access (in)equality on environmental degradation and the role governance plays using data from 47 sub-Saharan African countries from 2000-2020. Evidence from the heteroskedasticity-based instrumental variable regression consistent with Driscoll and Kraay's estimation revealed that bridging rural-urban energy access inequality is associated with reduction in environmental degradation. We also documented that the direct effect of the governance-related variables used is mixed. The moderation and marginal effect estimates showed that improving governance quality conditions equality in rural-urban energy access to reduce environmental degradation. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that the implementation of rural electrification policies supported by a good governance system would play a crucial role in mitigating environmental degradation in developing countries.

Abstract: The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) strategy for improving information on the status and trends of capture fisheries (FAO Strategy STF) was endorsed by Member States and the UN General Assembly in 2003. Its overall objective is to provide a framework, strategy, and plan to improve knowledge and understanding of the status and trends of fisheries as a basis for policy-making and management, towards conservation and sustainable use of resources within ecosystems. The FAO supports the implementation of FAO Strategy STF in developing countries through a project known as FAO FishCode-STF, and an initiative funded by the World Bank entitled the "BigNumbers project". The BigNumbers project underscored the importance of small-scale fisheries and revealed that catches by and employment in this sector tend to be underreported. An inventory of data collection systems made under the FAO FishCode-STF project showed that small-scale fisheries are not well covered. Their dispersed nature, the weak institutional capacity in many developing countries, and the traditional methods used make routine data collection cumbersome. Innovative sampling strategies are required. The main priority is a sample frame for small-scale fisheries. Sustainable strategies are most likely to be found outside the sector through population and agricultural household censuses and inside the sector through the direct involvement of fishers.

Abstract: Lack of data inhibits informed decision-making and is a critical challenge in developing countries, many of which are under-resourced in financial, technical and institutional capacity to collect and analyse the required data. This limits the countries' ability to achieve development goals and keeps them dependent on the provision of external resources. Development initiatives often treat capacity building and research as two separate tracks of development. While efforts have been made in the health sector to combine these through project-based learning, this approach is relatively unexplored in the water sector which by its inter-sectoral nature stands to benefit significantly from a more collaborative and solution-oriented development strategy. Capacity Building through Research (CBtR) facilitates data collection and analysis by local researchers, mentored by international experts, strengthening local capacity to produce credible evidence able to inform sustainability-related decision-making. Five case studies piloting CBtR are discussed here and evaluated through criteria of the Dutch Strategy Evaluation Protocol framework. CBtR is shown to be a long-term strategy that requires the strengthening of cross-disciplinary networks to enhance the capacity of water management institutions, which likely contributes to more efficient evidence collection and analysis suitable for decision-makers, leading to greater national resilience and reduced need for external support.

Abstract: Agro forestry is a land management system that integrates trees, agriculture crops, and animal farming in order to provide a diverse range of ecosystem services. Timor-Leste, the newest country and one of the least developed counties, has faced multidimensional challenges on land use management, including deforestation, land degradation, and poverty. The agroforestry system is recognized as one of the viable options for balancing the socio-economic needs and ecological functions of the lands in Timor-Leste. The system has been practiced traditionally by farmers in the country; however, the lack of knowledge and experience, limited institutional capacity, and lack of funding have impeded the wider implantation of the agroforestry system in Timor-Leste. The Strategic Development Plan of Timor-Leste has recommended sustainable agriculture and natural resources management in the rural areas of the country to generate income and create employment for the youths. The paper presents the initiatives, challenges, and opportunities of agroforestry application in Timor-Leste to support sustainable forest management and livelihood improvement. Learning from existing initiatives, capacity building, market access, and financial incentives could promote the agroforestry system in the country.

Abstract: The growing number of areas facing water scarcity necessitates adaptive water management strategies beyond traditional water supply and demand management methods, which are becoming increasingly difficult in many regions. Water reallocation offers a flexible water management approach to mitigate water scarcity under changing socioeconomic, climatic, and environmental conditions. In spite of the numerous benefits of reallocating water between users, examples of successful water transfers are relatively sparse and the expected benefits are rarely met in full due to several complex impediments. This study overviews the current body of water reallocation literature, with a particular focus on the key barriers to wider implementation of water reallocation. We argue that to overcome these obstacles a more interdisciplinary approach to water reallocation should be advanced that couples developments in the natural sciences and engineering disciplines with current water reallocation scholarship, which is predominately rooted in the social sciences. Many examples of water transfers from around the world are used to illustrate both the benefits and challenges associated with reallocation, as well as to identify measures to overcome some of the major difficulties. We conclude by calling for an integrated research platform that focuses on supporting both voluntary and nonvoluntary forms of water reallocation; however, a greater emphasis should be on nonmarket means of water transfer since it is more feasible for many regions where water rights are not well defined and institutional capacity is insufficient.

Abstract: This paper explores the impacts of informal economic activities and institutional capacity, particularly, corruption control on the environmental quality degradation of emerging economies under the prevailing socio-economic conditions and energy use patterns of the countries. The study utilizes key environmental degradation indicators: Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, ecological footprints (EFs), and Nitrous Oxide (NO) emissions, and a panel dataset of 15 emerging countries for the period 2002-2019 to undertake an empirical investigation. The pooled mean group (PMG)-ARDL estimator, Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS), Dynamic OLS (DOLS) and Augmented Mean Group (AMG) methods have been applied as empirical investigation techniques. The empirical findings reveal that in the long-run informal economic activities positively affect the environmental quality with fewer recorded emissions of CO2 and EFs while these activities affect negatively to NO emissions. This study has also found that corruption control improves environmental quality by reducing EFs and NO emissions but works to the opposite by increasing recorded CO2 emissions. An increase in economic growth and renewable energy consumption improves environmental quality in emerging countries, while consumption of non-renewable energy degrades the environmental quality. The robust empirical findings advocate policy initiatives for intense monitoring of informal activities and implementation of indirect tax policy to regulate informal activities and the pollution they cause. Careful measures of corruption control and initiatives to bring the informal economic activities into a formal framework are suggested to reduce CO2 and NO emissions. An increase in economic growth with more focus on renewables and phasing out non-renewables can ensure green growth in emerging countries.

Abstract: Road traffic injuries are a leading cause of socio-economic loss in East Asia Summit (EAS) countries. A regular performance rating to monitor progress and calibrate interventions is crucial for road safety improvement, helping to save human lives and reducing economic losses. To this end, we propose a new and easy-to-adapt multi-criteria decision-making method for systematically rating the road safety performance of the EAS coun-tries, the preference selection index with principal component analysis of RIDIT scores (PSI-PRIDIT) (scores of a distribution relative to an identified distribution integral transformation). Using the results from other classical methods as a reference, we rank the EAS countries robustly and place them into three groups over the last decade (2009-2019), based on the composite road safety development index. Our findings should be useful for EAS countries to detect underlying problems and identify best practices, as well as provide government officials, policymakers, and practitioners with meaningful guidelines on the adoption of successful road safety measures. Overall, the proposed rating framework should help to strengthen the institutional capacity for road safety management and addresses road safety issues.

Abstract: Background: People living with HlV/AlDS (PLWHA) in developing countries are rarely consulted about ways to promote their health and well-being. This study sought to identify and understand, from the perspective of PLWHA, challenges and opportunities for improving access to HIV treatment, care and support in Vietnam, a resource-limited setting with an epidemic driven by injecting drug use. Methods: PLWHA trained in participatory research methods completed fieldwork and data collection and co-facilitated focus groups with injecting drug users (IDUs) in Ho Chi Minh City. Qualitative data were analysed in Vietnamese and English using an inductive approach to code and compare content and identify key themes. Results: Results suggest considerable barriers to scaling up in this setting. Against a backdrop of punitive government policies, including mandatory detention of IDUs and sex workers, and widespread stigma and discrimination, many PLWHA lived with the fear of discovery and the threat of abandonment. Lack of confidentiality, limited financial resources and restricted access to essential medications provided powerful disincentives to health service utilisation. Conclusions: Opportunities for scaling up lie firstly in expanding access to confidential HIV counselling and testing. However, in the absence of affordable, quality care and access to anti-retroviral therapy, IDUs are unlikely to see testing as worthwhile. Efforts to scale up also need to address structural barriers including stigma and discrimination, poverty and institutional capacity. Finally, PLWHA in Vietnam are a significant but underutilised resource and consideration should be given to overcoming barriers to building confidence and capacity within affected communities.

Abstract: The real estate sector has emerged as the bedrock of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies, and it has remained resilient despite the various unprecedented micro- and macro-economic shocks devouring the world's economies. However, wavering investor attitudes and minimal exposure to real estate investment vehicles, coupled with weak regulatory frameworks, have led to dramatic downturns in the sector. Transparency about what is happening in real estate is imperative if the success of high-profile initiatives is to continue and much depends on good corporate governance (CG) in the sector. Using the most recent data from 2019, the current study applies the CG Index (CGI) and CG Deviation Index (CGDI) constructs to the real estate (RE) sector in the GCC in an effort to develop vital indicators for future RE investment decisions in the GCC region. The results indicate that the highest CG adherence levels are being achieved in Dubai, followed by Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. The authors attribute these countries' success in CG adherence to the entrepreneurial identity of them RE firms as well as to their governance capacity, their socio-cognitive capability, and the level of regulatory enforcement within the context of their dominant governance logic. It should be noted that there are variations in adherence levels throughout each region. The results also agree with prior literature that a higher CGS leads to a lower CGD score, and vice versa. At this point, encouraging more real estate investment trust (REIT) formations in the GCC could ensure value propositions, such as liquidity, to both investors and RE companies as well as solid governance fundamentals. This is strongly recommended for increasing the RE presence and its contribution to the GDP of each country.

Abstract: Epifluorescence microscopy has numerous applications in molluscan research. Methods rely on distinguishing target fluorescent signals from natural fluorescence, termed autofluorescence, of a specimen. Limited research has been conducted on the autofluorescence of marine bivalves, which hinders development of epifluorescence microscopy techniques in this sector. We examined autofluorescence in larvae of the giant clam Tridacna noae to identify challenges and opportunities in applying epifluorescence microscopy to the study of giant clams. Under blue-light excitation (lambda(ex) = 460-490 nm) three sources of autofluorescence were identified in larvae of T. noae: (1) green autofluorescence of the gut region; (2) green autofluorescence of the 'dark bodies' anatomical structure; and (3) red autofluorescence of ingested zooxanthellae, Symbiodinium species. Each of these sources of autofluorescence varied in prevalence and relative intensity over the course of larval development. The multiple sources and varied wavelengths of the observed autofluorescence presents challenges for applying fluorescent labelling techniques. However, our study identifies epifluorescence microscopy as a novel means of examining larval ontogeny and the uptake of zooxanthellae in giant clams.

Abstract: The need for substantial economic, political, and social integration among economies and an effective domestic governance system to create a more inclusive and clean energy economy cannot be underestimated. Overreliance on biomass and other dirty fuels for cooking in developing countries has contributed to the global climate change challenge. In this study, we examine the impact of globalization and governance on adopting clean fuels and cooking technologies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Regarding analytical approaches, we deploy econometric techniques such as Driscoll-Kraay and instrumental variable generalized method of moment techniques to control econometric issues such as autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, cross-sectional dependence, and endogeneity. The findings indicate that globalization (economic, social, and political) and governance (government effectiveness, control of corruption, political stability, and the rule of law) drive the adoption of clean fuels and technologies for cooking. The results further reveal that right-wing political leaders contribute significantly to adopting clean cooking fuels and technologies in SSA, while left-wing and center-wing political leaders do not. These findings differ among the sub-regions in SSA. Furthermore, interaction and marginal effect analyses suggest that improving governance system enhances the effect of globalization on access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. Hence, improving the efficacy of the domestic governance system could enable globalization to speed up the adoption of clean fuels and technologies for cooking in SSA.

Abstract: Implementing mitigation measures to limit global temperatures to below 2 degrees C poses several challenges. Even though Nepal's global emission contribution remains minimal, the nation is committed to the net zero targets aligned with the Paris Agreement through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and Long-Term Low greenhouse gas Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) by 2045, where the biggest emitters like India, China and European Union (EU) aims to achieve net zero by 2070, 2060 and 2050 respectively. In this context, detailed and concrete insights on context specific factors that inhibit or enable Nepal's mitigation measures to robust climate action are still at its infancy. We assessed the enablers and barriers to implementing mitigation measures across the energy, transport and forestry sectors. For this, an adapted version of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC's) Feasibility Assessment Framework is used, with data triangulated through an extensive literature review, as well as qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews with sector- specific experts (n = 25), policymakers (n = 15) and industry managers (n = 10). Our results indicated that geophysical and topographical barriers are relatively less prominent. However, the institutional capacity and governance, and cross-sectional coordination inhibit the implementation of mitigation measures. Addressing institutional barriers, such as policy gaps, regulatory frameworks, capacity building and coordination challenges, is essential for unlocking the full potential of enablers and overcoming obstacles. This research serves as a valuable guide for countries like Nepal, helping them gain insights into the challenges they may encounter on their journey to net zero targets.

Abstract: Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals requires countries to determine targets for the protection, conservation, or restoration of coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests by 2030. Satellite remote sensing provides historical and current data on the distribution and dynamics of mangrove forests, essential baseline data that are needed to design suitable policy interventions. In this study, Landsat time series were used to map trends and dynamics of mangrove change over a time span of 30 years (1987-2017) in protected areas of Hainan Island (China). A support vector machine algorithm was combined with visual interpretation of imagery and result showed alternating periods of expansion and loss of mangrove forest at seven selected sites on Hainan Island. Over this period, there was a net decrease in mangrove area of 9.3%, with anthropic activities such as land conversion for aquaculture, wastewater disposal and discharge, and tourism development appearing to be the likely drivers of this decline in cover. Long-term studies examining trends in land use cover change coupled with assessments of drivers of loss or gain enable the development of evidence based on policy and legislation. This forms the basis of financing of natural reserves of management and institutional capacity building, and facilitates public awareness and participation, including co-management.

Abstract: According to an increasingly prevalent set of discourses and practices within environmental and development finance, cities across the Global South are facing a costly infrastructural crisis stemming from rapid urbanization and climate change that threatens to further entrench poverty and precarity for millions of people. The cost of achieving urban resilience across the world dwarfs available public finance, however, from both development banks and governments themselves. Meanwhile, vast amounts of money on capital markets are searching for profitable investment opportunities. The World Bank is attempting to channel return-seeking investment into urban infrastructure in response to these challenges. To harness this private finance, though, cities must be reformatted in investment-friendly ways. In this article, we chart the emergence of this discourse and associated practices within the World Bank. We call this rescaled and climate-inflected program of leveraged investments coupled with technical assistance Green Structural Adjustment. Drawing on policy documents, reports, and interviews with key staff, we examine programs that include Green Structural Adjustment to show how it aims to restructure local governments to capture new financial flows. Green Structural Adjustment reduces adaptation to a question of infrastructure finance and government capacity building, reinscribing both causes and effects of uneven development while creating spatial fixes for overaccumulated Northern capital in the Global South.

Abstract: Health systems of low and middle income countries in the Asia Pacific have been described as mixed, where public and private sector operate in parallel. Gaps in the provision of primary health care (PHC) services have been picked up by the private sector and led to its growth; as can an enabling regulatory environment. The question whether governments should purchase services from the private sector to address gaps in service provision has been fiercely debated. This purposive review draws evidence from systematic reviews, and additional published and grey literature, for input into a policy brief on purchasing PHC-services from the private sector for underserved areas in the Asia Pacific region. Additional published and grey literature on vouchers and contracting as mechanisms to engage the private sector was used to supplement the conclusions from systematic reviews. We analysed the literature through a policy lens, or alternatively, a 'bottom-up' approach which incorporates components of a realist review. Evidence indicates that both vouchers and contracting can improve health service outcomes in underserved areas. These outcomes however are strongly influenced by (1) contextual factors, such as roles and functions attributable to a shared set of key actors (2) the type of delivered services and community demand (3) design of the intervention, notably provider autonomy and trust (4) governance capacity and provision of stewardship. Examining the experience of vouchers and contracting to expand health services through engagement with private sector providers in the Asia Pacific found positive effects with regards to access and utilisation of health services, but more importantly, highlighted the significance of contextual factors, appropriate selection of mechanism for services provided, and governance arrangements and stewardship capacity. In fact, for governments seeking to engage the private sector, analysis of context and capacities are potentially a more useful frame than generalizable outcomes of effectiveness.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: LIVING TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY: JUDICIAL DEFERRAL IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY

Abstract: Even many years after Marbury v. Madison, and even in the face of the spread of aggressive constitutional court review in democracies around the world, the ability of courts to assert their authority against the political branches continues to demand explanation. Especially in newly minted democracies, and most so in countries emerging from authoritarian rule, how courts can engage the misuse of state power remains a bit of a mystery. This Article examines the hitherto under-studied phenomenon of judicial deferral as providing some insight into how courts acquire the institutional capacity to engage in robust judicial review and, in particular, how the deferral of implementation avoids direct political confrontations for the judiciary. Unlike in the United States, constitutional court decisions around the world frequently delay the practical effect of their decisions. This Article explores various modes of judicial deferral, including suspended declarations of invalidity, doctrines of prospective overruling and progressive implementation, and more implicit or forms of delay involving narrow rulings paired with broad dicta. It also considers different functions served by judicial deferral, including practical concerns about smooth transition from one legal regime to another, democratic legitimacy and dialogue, and more political concerns about ensuring the legal and political preconditions necessary for effective judicial review; and the connections between these various 'first' and 'second' order modes and functions of deferral. Once examined in this light, it turns out that various deferral-based strategies have been used by courts in some of the most successful systems of constitutional review in recent years, including in Germany, India, Colombia, and Indonesia. Finally, this Article turns to both the preconditions necessary for successful deferral and the corresponding risks when delay simply postpones an inevitable conflict.

Abstract: The East Asian region generally and Southeast Asia in particular have long been associated with authoritarian rule. It is argued that the intensification of a range of environmental problems means that authoritarian rule is likely to become even more commonplace there in the future. Countries with limited state capacity will struggle to deal with the consequences of population expansion, economic development and the environmental degradation with which they are associated. A resurgence of authoritarian rule is made even more likely by China's 'successful' developmental example and the extent of the region's existing environmental problems. The dispiriting reality may be that authoritarian regimes - unattractive as they may be - may even prove more capable of responding to the complex political and environmental pressures in the region than some of its democracies.

Abstract: Notwithstanding a huge deposit of natural resources in West Africa, the region has consistently recorded unimpressive economic performances, thus prompting an important question: what other things, besides resources endowment, does the region need in order to grow? In an attempt to look into this, we examine the roles of FDI, globalisation, and economic-governance alongside that of natural resources endowment on the growth of the West African economy. Using the panel ARDL technique on the West African data covering 1996-2016, we confirm that the impact of natural resources endowment on economic growth is significant and positive. Also, FDI exerts a positive effect on economic growth, while the coefficient of globalisation is mixed. Finally, we find that government effectiveness stimulates the growth of the region; it, however, reduces the positive effect of natural resources endowment while regulatory quality enhances the positive effect of natural resources endowment on economic growth. Given these findings, the governments of West African countries are enjoined to further promote the economic institutions of the states - entrench public and civil services efficiency, promote the formulation and strict implementation of regulations and sound policies - in order to promote both domestic and foreign (private) investments. Also, the governments of the West African states should key-in to the globalisation agenda by enhancing the competitiveness of local markets in order to compete meritoriously with foreign firms.

Abstract: Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problems necessitate a methodology that is able to produce reliable and defendable decisions. This is especially the case when it comes to safety system analyses. This study constructs an integrated model, CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) - Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) - Spectral Clustering (SC) (i.e., CRITIC-MOORA-SC), which seamlessly incorporates three stages of MCDM (weighting, aggregating, and grouping) with decomposing into one process, with the capacity to deal with decision difficulties while maintaining a high level of reliability. The model is designed to support the transport safety analyses of 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as Timor-Leste, including measuring road safety development, ranking and grouping safety performances, deconstructing safety performance indicators, decomposing overall achievement, quantifying safety changes over the past decade, and benchmarking approved practices. Enhanced comparisons of the results indicate the reliability and practicability of the proposed model, verifying its applicability for realworld decision activities. By doing so, this study provides policymakers and managers in the ASEAN region, as well as other parts of the world, with a support tool for creditable analyses in transport safety, strengthening their institutional capacity in decision-making activities.

Abstract: This paper provides an introduction and overview for the special issue on systematic conservation planning in the species-rich and highly vulnerable Cape Floristic Region. Firstly, we outline the three major problems that created the need for a systematic conservation plan and implementation programme in the region, namely an existing reserve system that is not representative of biodiversity patterns and processes, escalating threats to biodiversity, and diminishing institutional capacity. Secondly, we present the framework used for the planning and implementation process, place the contributions to the special issue in this context, and summarise current implementation initiatives. Thirdly, we extract from these studies and our own experience a number of lessons that were learnt during the planning process. Foremost amongst these lessons is a requirement for effective incorporation of implementation issues at all stages of the planning process. Other lessons include the need to consult and involve stakeholders at the local (municipal) level, the importance of a common planning framework for all teams contributing to the plan, the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity concerns as an implementation mechanism, the requirement for a critical level of home-grown capacity for undertaking ecoregional planning, and the value of expert knowledge when incorporated into a systematic planning framework. We conclude by suggesting that the approach used in this planning process, modified by (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Critical Geographies with the State: The Problem of Social Vulnerability and the Politics of Engaged Research

Abstract: State interventions to govern social vulnerability highlight the complexity of contemporary states, marked by neoliberal agenda but also by progressive interventions and the desire for effectiveness. This paper draws on collaborative research with government agencies on social vulnerability in the Hunter region to assess the desirability of undertaking critical geographies with the state. We see states as contested terrains invested with the institutional capacity to mobilise diverse political projects. We argue that critical research in partnership with states is possible, as are mobilisations of the agency of state institutions to promote progressive policy development. The paper explores how we might use engaged research to intersect with the production and circulation of texts, technologies and practices within the state apparatus to achieve desirable change. While critical research with the state involves uncertainties and compromise, with no permanent resolutions, we conclude that states must remain centred in our critical conversations and praxis. In this paper we advance the case for the critical possibilities of policy-oriented research with the state. We reflect on experiences of an engaged research project with state government agencies in the NSW Hunter Region involving the production and use of the texts and technologies as state interventions in social vulnerability. Working through the project's reflexive, collaborative methodologies and our use of critical GIS, we highlight the creation of opportunities to change how the components of social vulnerability were conceptualised, contest policymakers view of what was relevant, and shift framing rationalities and resultant state practices. As such the paper contributes to our knowledge of strategic research practices for pursuing critical, progressive projects with the state. Such engagement involves uncertainties and contingent compromise. Yet, as terrains of contestation wherein diverse political projects are assembled and propelled, states must remain centred in our critical conversations and in our critical praxis.

Abstract: Holothuria scabra (sandfish) is a tropical sea cucumber that has been over-exploited because of its high-value in the beche-de-mer trade. It is amenable to mariculture and the potential for community-based sea ranching has been investigated in the Tigak Islands of Papua New Guinea (PNG). A 5-ha trial sea ranch was established within the fishing grounds of an island community and protected from fishing for the duration of this study. Over 10 months, 5655 fluorochrome-marked H. scabra juveniles were stocked into the centre of the sea ranch. Linetransects were used to survey sea cucumber within and on the periphery of the sea ranch prior to stocking the sea ranch (October 2018) and at the conclusion of the study (February 2020). Additional collections of H. scabra were made at night in a 1-ha area around the stocking site. All H. scabra were weighed and checked for fluorochrome marks to determine cultured or wild origin. An estimated 3.7 +/- 0.9% of cultured H. scabra were recoverable in the post-stocking survey. Cultured juveniles were found at a significantly higher density only around the stocking site. Factors potentially contributing to low recovery of cultured H. scabra include mortality, being overlooked, migration and misidentification of cultured and wild individuals. Species richness and density of the wild sea cucumber community increased in response to stocking and protecting the sea ranch. Our results highlight the importance of site-specific monitoring and evaluation to assess the success of sea ranching. Despite low recovery, H. scabra mariculture remains a promising option in PNG, as wild stocks are predicted to decline with increased fishing pressure, thus limiting recruitment. This will be aided by improved production of release-size juvenile H. scabra, improved release protocols to promote higher recovery of cultured juveniles and improved community capacity to manage cultured and wild sea cucumber stocks.

Abstract: ObjectiveTo explore the clinical practices, risks, and maternal outcomes associated with postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). DesignSecondary analysis of cross-sectional data. SettingA total of 352 health facilities in 28 countries. SampleA total of 274985 women giving birth between 1 May 2010 and 31 December 2011. MethodsWe used multivariate logistic regression to examine factors associated with PPH among all births, and the Pearson chi-square test to examine correlates of severe maternal outcomes (SMOs) among women with PPH. All analyses adjust for facility- and country-level clustering. Main outcome measuresPPH, SMOs, and clinical practices for the management of PPH. ResultsOf all the women included in the analysis, 95.3% received uterotonic prophylaxis and the reported rate of PPH was 1.2%. Factors significantly associated with PPH diagnosis included age, parity, gestational age, induction of labour, caesarean section, and geographic region. Among those with PPH, 92.7% received uterotonics for treatment, and 17.2% had an SMO. There were significant differences in the incidence of SMOs by age, parity, gestational age, anaemia, education, receipt of uterotonics for prophylaxis or treatment, referral from another facility, and Human Development Index (HDI) group. The rates of death were highest in countries with low or medium HDIs. ConclusionsAmong women with PPH, disparities in the incidence of severe maternal outcomes persist, even among facilities that report capacity to provide all essential emergency obstetric interventions. This highlights the need for better information about the role of institutional capacity, including quality of care, in PPH-related morbidity and mortality.

Abstract: The interactions between conflict and local development has puzzled scholars and practitioners alike. This article explores why the advent of peace in Colombia's emerald-mining regions for the past few years, as well as a broader national peace process, has not delivered the expected development dividends among mining communities. We contrast differences in stakeholders' perceptions between levels of governance (local, regional and national). Based on the research, we conclude that while stakeholder collaboration is successful at the regional and national levels of governance, it fails at the local level. While peace has allowed an increase in mainstream business investment in mining, this has concentrated production in a few hands leading to a deterioration in many aspects of community livelihoods and wealth distribution. There has been a shift in the concentration of wealth and production from traditional elites to large companies. Communities noted a loss of collective assets and lack of community and institutional capacity to overcome pressing issues in a post-conflict market economy that favors those who control capital and technology. Based on an evaluation of community perceptions through a focus group methodology, this study recommends ways to prepare and better coordinate stakeholders to engage with complex relationships, and protect community assets in a collaborative governance scenario. This research suggests that political reconciliation processes amid complex resource geographies require greater devolution and community engagement on post-conflict economic development during the peace process itself.

Abstract: The tri-island state of Grenada, Carriacou, and Petit Martinique's legislative and institutional compliance with the World Organisation for Animal Health's (OIE) guidelines on antimicrobial utilisation in poultry production is reviewed in this paper. This includes legislative and other institutional documents, coupled with interviews with veterinary officers, health officers and managers of the veterinary drug distribution centres were conducted to evaluate the extent of Grenada's compliance with the OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code in the use of antimicrobials in poultry production. Five thematic areas were evaluated: 1) legislative and institutional arrangements; 2) surveillance and reporting; 3) risks associated with the importation of poultry meat products; 4) ante-and post-mortem inspection; and 5) procurement and use of antimicrobials. The information revealed that the current legislative framework in Grenada does not adequately address poultry food safety and that there is a need to strengthen the synergies between the agricultural and health sectors to enable a more thorough monitoring of antimicrobials use in poultry production. There is a need to strengthen epidemiology of zoonotic diseases, provisioning of education and information for key stakeholders about the use of antibiotics and the development of a system to monitor antibiotic procurement, distribution and use in Grenada. These findings have implications for other small island states in the Caribbean that have similar limitations in institutional capacity and knowledge deficits in the prudent use of antibiotics.

Abstract: Background: In humanitarian settings, strengthening health systems while responding to the health needs of crisis-affected populations is challenging and marked with evidence gaps. Drawing from a decade of family planning and postabortion care programming in humanitarian settings, this paper aims to identify strategic components that contribute to health system strengthening in such contexts.Materials and Methods: A diverse range of key informants from North Kivu (Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC) and Puntland (Somalia), including female and male community members, adolescents and adults, healthcare providers, government and community leaders, participated in qualitative interviews, which applied the World Health Organization health system building blocks framework. Data were thematically analyzed according to this framework.Results: Findings from the focus group discussions (11 in DRC, 7 in Somalia) and key informant interviews (seven in DRC, four in Somalia) involving in total 54 female and 72 male participants across both countries indicate that health programs in humanitarian settings, such as Save the Children's initiative on family planning and postabortion care, could contribute to strengthening health systems by positively influencing national policies and guidance, strengthening local coordination mechanisms, capacitating the healthcare workforce with competency-based training and supportive supervision (benefiting facilities supported by the project and beyond), developing the capacity of Ministry of Health staff in the effective management of the supply chain, actively and creatively mobilizing the community to raise awareness and create demand, and providing quality and affordable services. Financial sustainability is challenged by the chronically limited healthcare expenditure experienced in both humanitarian contexts.Conclusions: In humanitarian settings, carefully designed healthcare interventions, such as those that address the family planning and postabortion care needs of crisis-affected populations, have the potential not only to increase access to essential services but also contribute to strengthening several components of the health system while increasing the government capacity, ownership, and accountability.

Abstract: Bangladesh has been a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) although implementation of the convention has been poor. We independently assessed the extent to which the program of work (POW) of the CBD has been implemented in Bangladesh by carrying out workshops involving local communities, conservation organizations, universities, and government departments involved in forest conservation. Our analyses indicate that there is little or no understanding of the ecosystem approach that is central to the CBD; forestry practices remain primitive and largely ineffective; forest destruction continues at high rates; restoration of degraded forests are minimal; protected areas are small and ineffective; indigenous peoples' rights are nominal and are outside any legislation; threats to species have been identified, but little is being done to reduce threats; there is no work on pollution and its mitigation; some work has been done to adapt to climate change; the institutional environment does not enable effective implementation of the ecosystem approach; laws and policies are ineffective; institutional capacity is poor; government will is limited or totally lacking; and knowledge base remains poor, although reporting has improved and various strategic plans have been formulated but never implemented. Thus, the implementation of CBD in Bangladesh requires systemic changes in policy at the institutional levels as well as complementary changes in attitudes and avenues of alternate income generation.

Abstract: Arsenic in well water can exhibit large spatial variability such that two neighboring wells within tens of meters may be safe or unsafe for drinking, which is why well switching is recognized and is being promoted as a useful mitigation strategy. In Meherpur Sadar of Bangladesh where a previous survey identified a mixture of safe (<0.05 mg L-1) and unsafe wells in most villages, UNICEF initiated a pay-for-use well screening and marking program. Local workers were trained to test arsenic using field test kits, and conducted testing at the request of the villagers who paid 20 taka (about USD 0.30) per test. Half of the fee from each test was paid to the tester, and the other half was put into a revolving fund established at the upazila level. Households with heavily contaminated sources switched to other wells. In Ujalpur village of Kutubpur Union and Fotapur village of Buripota Union where 77 and 37 sources were contaminated with >0.2 mg L-1 arsenic, 100 per cent and 50 per cent of the households switched to safe sources, respectively. An arsenic screening campaign using the pay-for-use model with local government capacity building and private sector engagement is being rolled out starting in 2012 to meet the demand expected from a mass media campaign for user paid arsenic testing. The model offers the advantage of making a crucial service available to rural villagers and increasing the likelihood of actions to reduce exposure.

Abstract: Reaching out to the poor and the informal sector is a major challenge for achieving universal coverage in lesser-developed countries. In Cambodia, extensive coverage by health equity funds for the poor has created the opportunity to consolidate various non-government health financing schemes under the government's proposed social health protection structure. This paper identifies the main policy and operational challenges to strengthening existing arrangements for the poor and the informal sector, and considers policy options to address these barriers. Conducted in conjunction with the Cambodian Ministry of Health in 2011-12, the study reviewed policy documents and collected qualitative data through 18 semi-structured key informant interviews with government, non-government and donor officials. Data were analysed using the Organizational Assessment for Improving and Strengthening Health Financing conceptual framework. We found that a significant shortfall related to institutional, organisational and health financing issues resulted in fragmentation and constrained the implementation of social health protection schemes, including health equity funds, community-based health insurance, vouchers and others. Key documents proposed the establishment of a national structure for the unification of the informal-sector schemes but left unresolved issues related to structure, institutional capacity and the third-party status of the national agency. This study adds to the evidence base on appropriate and effective institutional and organizational arrangements for social health protection in the informal sector in developing countries. Among the key lessons are: the need to expand the fiscal space for health care; a commitment to equity; specific measures to protect the poor; building national capacity for administration of universal coverage; and working within the specific national context.

Abstract: Background Qualitative studies evaluating maternal mental health services are lacking in Ethiopia, and the available evidence targets severe mental illnesses in the general population. We conducted a qualitative study to explore barriers to, enablers of, or opportunities for perinatal depression health services implementations in Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a total of 13 face to face interviews with mental and maternal health service administrators from different levels of the Ethiopian healthcare system. We interviewed in Amharic (a local language), transcribed and translated into English, and imported into NVivo. We analysed the translated interviews inductively using thematic framework analysis. Results The study identified: (i) health administrators' low literacy about perinatal depression as individual level barriers; (ii) community low awareness, health-seeking behaviours and cultural norms about perinatal depression as socio-cultural level barriers; (iii) lack of government capacity, readiness, and priority of screening and managing perinatal depression as organisational level barriers; and (iv) lack of mental health policy, strategies, and healthcare systems as structural level barriers of perinatal mental health implementation in Ethiopia. The introduction of the new Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGap), health professionals' commitment, and simplicity of screening programs were identified enablers of, or opportunities for, perinatal mental health service implementation. Conclusions This qualitative inquiry identified important barriers and potential opportunities that could be used to address perinatal depression in Ethiopia. Building the capacity of policy makers and planners, strengthening the mental healthcare system and governance should be a priority issue for an effective integration of maternal mental health care with the routine maternal health services in Ethiopia.

Abstract: Background: Many countries are responding to the global shortage of midwives by increasing the student intake to their midwifery schools. At the same time, attention must be paid to the quality of education being provided, so that quality of midwifery care can be assured. Methods of assuring quality of education include accreditation schemes, but capacity to implement such schemes is weak in many countries. Objective: This paper describes the process of developing and pilot testing the International Confederation of Midwives' Midwifery Education Accreditation Programme (ICM MEAP), based on global standards for midwifery education, and discusses the potential contribution it can make to building capacity and improving quality of care for mothers and their newborns. Methods: A review of relevant global, regional and national standards and tools informed the development of a set of assessment criteria (which was validated during an international consultation exercise) and a process for applying these criteria to midwifery schools. The process was pilot tested in two countries: Comoros and Trinidad and Tobago. Results: The assessment criteria and accreditation process were found to be appropriate in both country contexts, but both were refined after the pilot to make them more user-friendly. Conclusion: The ICM MEAP has the potential to contribute to improving health outcomes for women and newborns by building institutional capacity for the provision of high-quality midwifery education and thus improved quality of midwifery care, via improved accountability for the quality of midwifery education.

Abstract: Understanding local stakeholders' perceptions of co-management institutional activities serves a significant role in the proper functioning of the co-management institutions for the Sundarban mangrove forest conservation effort, but this currently remains unexplored. This study aimed to identify the current co-management institutions, co-management activities, and local people's understanding of these activities in the implementation of the co-management approach.

Thematic content analysis was conducted on the qualitative data, which had been collected through key informant interviews at the local, regional and national levels, followed by focus group discussions in the study villages. The key forest co-management activities and practices identified were: forest protection and monitoring; meetings; local livelihood initiatives; and organisational supports. These comanagement activities were implemented through institutions largely situated at the local level, through Village Conservation Forum, People's Forum and Community Patrol Group; higher-level institutions included the Co-management Committee, where local, district and national stakeholders were represented. Local people with forest dependency were participating in forest co-management activities and their awareness of forest conservation and social network had increased. In addition, people who had received training from government and non-government organisations reported benefits such as improved resource harvesting techniques, organisational skills and practical knowledge, which would be useful in times of natural disasters. However, local people also reported a range of issues affecting their full participation, which included top down decision-making, insignificant financial support, absence of alternate income sources, lack of meeting places for VCF members, gender inequality in participation, corruption and lack of skill-based training. A key governance issue for the local-level forest co-management institutions was limited access to the government organisations who oversaw policy and institutional control. In contrast, non-government organisations provided important institutional capacity-building support to local communities, and acted as a conduit to higher level committees. Broader impact could be achieved by fostering local participation, especially that of women, through genuine collaboration with other stakeholders, and extending the lessons learned from the study villages through exchange visits and sharing of ideas with other VCF villages in the area.

Abstract: Despite the proposed ecological and systems-based perspectives of the settings-based approach to health promotion, most initiatives have tended to overlook the fundamental nature of ecosystems. This paper responds to this oversight by proposing an explicit re-integration of ecosystems within the healthy settings approach. We make this case by focusing on water as an integrating unit of analysis. Water, on which all life depends, is not only an integral consideration for the existing healthy settings (schools, hospitals, workplaces) but also highlights the ecosystem context of health and sustainability. A focus on catchments (also know as watersheds and river basins) exemplifies the scaled and upstream/downstream nature of ecosystems and draws into sharp focus the cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary context of the social and environmental determinants of health. We position this work in relation to the converging agendas of health promotion and ecosystem management at the local, regional and global scales-025EFand draw on evidence from international initiatives as diverse as the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Using water as a vehicle for understanding the systemic context for human wellbeing, health promotion and disease prevention draws inevitable attention to key challenges of scale, intersectoral governance and the complementary themes of promoting resilience and preventing vulnerability. We conclude by highlighting the importance of building individual and institutional capacity for this kind of integration-025EFequipping a new generation of researchers, practitioners and decision-makers to be conversant with the language of ecosystems, capable of systemic thought and focused on settings that can promote both health and sustainability.

Abstract: Many cities seek urban green infrastructure to improve their liveability amid rapid urbanisation and climate change. The changes brought by urban green infrastructure are often reflected in socio-economic growth and environmental health. Yet, the development agendas of many cities, especially in Africa, do not always reflect the benefits of urban green infrastructure. Framed around the Achimota Forest Reserve in Ghana, this study intends to open the discussion on urban planning-sustainability narrative by: (i) assessing the land use land cover changes of urban forests; (ii) analysing the factors influencing the changes in urban forests; and (iii) examining urban planning responses towards management of urban forests and their implications for urban sustainability. Mixed methods approach involving spatial data analysis, secondary data review, and agency and community interviews was used. Findings suggest a critical urban planning neglect, low institutional capacity and nonchalant community attitudes leading to a loss of Achimota Forest Reserve (about 0.35 % per annum) between 1999 and 2019. The findings show that there are rapid changes in the land use structure and integrity of the Achimota Forest Reserve, with both urban planning and sustainability implications on Accra. With rapid urbanisation and weak management regulatory framework, urban forest in the research area is affected by rapid encroachment of physical development and unauthorised practices by some urban residents. This research concludes that consideration and implementation of proactive approaches by management institutions are required to make urban forest sustainable and to ensure their ongoing provision of ecological services to the city.

Abstract: This study investigates the barriers to managing debris waste in the post-earthquake period in T & uuml;rkiye following the significant earthquakes of 2023. Debris waste in the aftermath of earthquakes poses significant challenges to society and the environment. Thus, the critical need for effective debris waste management is essential to identifying and prioritizing barriers that impede the process. The study fills a gap in the literature by integrating Interpretive-Structural-Modeling (ISM), Decision-Making-Trial, and Evaluation-Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Neutrosophic Fuzzy Sets (NFSs) methodologies to assess barriers in the management of earthquake debris waste. The integrated approach considers technical, economic, regularity, environmental, and social dynamics influencing debris waste management. The results show that the first causal barrier is the "lack of legal enforcement," which has the most significant impact. The lack of legal regulations is caused by insufficient financial, technical, and institutional capacity, especially in Turkiye and similar developing countries. Secondly, the "lack of awareness regarding the environment" is another barrier to effectively managing post-earthquake debris. To improve post-earthquake debris management, the study highlights the importance of barriers for policymakers to create effective and sustainable management strategies. It also contributes to advancing circular economy practices and achieving sustainable development goals 3-8-9 and 11. Further, it assists managers and policymakers in effectively managing debris waste after earthquakes by providing insights into the interrelationships of barriers and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: How do Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) evolve in Bangladesh regarding legislation? Who should be in the governance of SEA in Bangladesh? What future challenges lie ahead of this transition to the SEA system in Bangladesh, and how to address them? The application context of SEA is in its early stage of development in Bangladesh as an environmental assessment tool for policy, plans, and programs (PPPs). Nevertheless, SEA has meaningfully started to roll in many PPPs by the political will of some key government institutions in Bangladesh. In such a scenario, we aimed to review the progression of EIA to SEA evolution in line with the current legislative practice and environmental governance by archival research strategy. We have further addressed several significant issues: the future of SEA application in Bangladesh, SEA governance within the authorities and the future obstacles of the SEA system and how to overcome them in Bangladesh. This study shows a potential for applying the SEA for developing PPPs to ensure sustainable development in Bangladesh. However, there are still challenges ahead to make the SEA fully functional. The challenges include the environmental governance concerning SEA, encoding SEA guidelines, and legislations associated with SEA implementation. Moreover, capacity building, technical review of SEA quality, and approval process of SEA reporting and coordination among the government institutions are required. To address the challenges, governance for the institutional authority for SEA and ownership development is necessary. Furhtermore, amendment of existing environmental acts and guidelines to incorporate SEA, institutional capacity building by professional training and awareness development, mainstreaming SEA education and practices are required to overcome the challenges.

Abstract: In this paper we explain the current condition of the Bau-Bau River, examine community participation for management of the river system, and consider options for improving the institutional capacity for a community-based approach. This assessment is based on a research project with the following objectives: (1) analyse the biophysical and socio-economic condition of the river as a basis for future planning; (2) identify current activities which contribute waste or pollution to the river; (3) assess the status and level of pollution in the river; (4),analyse community participation related to all stages of river management; and (5) identify future river management needs and opportunities. Due to the increasing population in Bau-Bau city, considerable new land is required for housing, roads, agriculture, social facilities, etc. Development in the city and elsewhere has increased run-off and erosion, as well as sedimentation in the river. In addition, household activities are generating more solid and domestic waste that causes organic pollution in the river. The research results show that the water quality in the upper river system is still good, whilst the,quality of water in the vicinity of Bau-Bau city, from the mid-point of the watershed to the estuary, is not good, being contaminated with heavy metals (Cd and Pb) and organic, pollutants. However,the levels of those pollutants are still below regulatory standards. The main reasons for pollution in the river are mainly lack of management for both liquid and solid wastes, as well as lack of community participation in river management. The government of Bau-Bau city and the community are developing a participatory approach for planning to restore and conserve the Bau-Bau River as well as the entire catchment. The activities of this project are::(1) forming institutional arrangements to support river conservation; (2) implementing extension initiatives to empower the community; (3) identifying a specific location to establish an urban forest; (4) implementing demonstration projects for liquid system management; (5) promoting coordination amongst the different organisations and,agencies in the catchment; (6) improving,domestic,waste transportation; and (7) recycling waste to create compost material to become an income source for the community.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Toward a Coordinated Global Observing System for Seagrasses and Marine Macroalgae

Abstract: In coastal waters around the world, the dominant primary producers are benthic macrophytes, including seagrasses and macroalgae, that provide habitat structure and food for diverse and abundant biological communities and drive ecosystem processes. Seagrass meadows and macroalgal forests play key roles for coastal societies, contributing to fishery yields, storm protection, biogeochemical cycling and storage, and important cultural values. These socio-economically valuable services are threatened worldwide by human activities, with substantial areas of seagrass and macroalgal forests lost over the last half-century. Tracking the status and trends in marine macrophyte cover and quality is an emerging priority for ocean and coastal management, but doing so has been challenged by limited coordination across the numerous efforts to monitor macrophytes, which vary widely in goals, methodologies, scales, capacity, governance approaches, and data availability. Here, we present a consensus assessment and recommendations on the current state of and opportunities for advancing global marine macrophyte observations, integrating contributions from a community of researchers with broad geographic and disciplinary expertise. With the increasing scale of human impacts, the time is ripe to harmonize marine macrophyte observations by building on existing networks and identifying a core set of common metrics and approaches in sampling design, field measurements, governance, capacity building, and data management. We recommend a tiered observation system, with improvement of remote sensing and remote underwater imaging to expand capacity to capture broad-scale extent at intervals of several years, coordinated with strati fied in situ sampling annually to characterize the key variables of cover and taxonomic or functional group composition, and to provide ground-truth. A robust networked system of macrophyte observations will be facilitated by establishing best practices, including standard protocols, documentation, and sharing of resources at all stages of work flow, and secure archiving of open-access data. Because such a network is necessarily distributed, sustaining it depends on close engagement of local stakeholders and focusing on building and long-term maintenance of local capacity, particularly in the developing world. Realizing these recommendations will producemore effective, efficient, and responsive observing, a more accurate global picture of change in vegetated coastal systems, and stronger international capacity for sustaining observations.

Abstract: Latin American (LA) megacities are facing enormous challenges to provide welfare to millions of people who live in them. High rates of urbanization and limited administrative capacity of LA cities to plan and control urban growth have led to a critical deficit of urban green space, and therefore, to sub-optimal outcomes in terms of urban sustainability. This study seeks to assess the possibility of using real estate prices to provide an estimate of the monetary value of the ecosystem services provided by urban green space across five Latin American megacities: Bogota, Buenos Aires, Lima, Mexico City and Santiago de Chile. Using Google Earth images to quantify urban green space and multiple regression analysis, we evaluated the impact of urban green space, crime rates, business density and population density on real estate prices across the five mentioned megacities. In addition, for a subset of the data (Lima and Buenos Aires) we analyzed the effects of landscape ecology variables (green space patch size, connectivity, etc.) on real estate prices to provide a first insight into how the ecological attributes of urban green space can determine the level of ecosystem service provision in different urban contexts in Latin America. The results show a strong positive relationship between the presence of urban green space and real estate prices. Green space explains 52% of the variability in real estate prices across the five studied megacities. Population density, business density and crime had only minor impacts on real estate prices. Our analysis of the landscape ecology variables in Lima and Buenos Aires also show that the relationship between green space and price is context-specific, which indicates that further research is needed to better understand when and where ecological attributes of green space affect real estate prices so that managers of urban green space in LA cities can optimize ecological configuration to maximize ecosystem service provision from often limited green spaces.

Abstract: COVID-19 imposed unprecedented financing requirements on countries to rapidly implement effective prevention and control measures while dealing with severe economic contraction. The challenges were particularly acute for the 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR), home to the lowest average level of public expenditure on health of all WHO regions. We conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed, grey literature and publicly available sources to analyse the immediate health financing policies adopted by countries in the WHO SEAR in response to COVID-19 in the first 12 months of the pandemic, i.e. from 1 March 2020 to 1 March 2021. Our review focused on the readiness of health systems to address the financial challenges of COVID-19 in terms of revenue generation, financial protection and strategic purchasing including public financial management issues. Twenty peer-reviewed articles were included, and web searches identified media articles (n = 21), policy reports (n = 18) and blog entries (n = 5) from reputable sources. We found that countries in the SEAR demonstrated great flexibility in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including exploring various options for revenue raising, removing financial barriers to care and rapidly adapting purchasing arrangements. At the same time, the pandemic exposed pre-existing health financing policy weaknesses such as underinvestment, inadequate regulatory capacity of the private health sector and passive purchasing, which should give countries an impetus for reform towards more resilient health systems. Further monitoring and evaluation are needed to assess the long-term implications of policy responses on issues such as government capacity for debt servicing and fiscal space for health and how they protect progress towards the objectives of universal health coverage.

Abstract: Knowledge co-production (KCP) is presented as an effective strategy to inform responses to complex coastal and marine social-ecological challenges. Co-production processes are further posited to improve research and decision outcomes in a wide range of problem contexts (e.g., biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation), for example, by facilitating social learning among diverse actors. As such, KCP processes are increasingly centered in global environment initiatives such as the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. However, KCP is not a panacea, and much uncertainty remains about its emergence and implementation, in particular, the manner in which broader governance contexts determine the interplay of knowledge, power, and decision-making. Three objectives guide our analysis: (1) to interrogate more fully the interplay among social relations of power, knowledge production practices, and the (colonial) governance contexts in which they are embedded; (2) to consider the challenges and limitations of KCP in particular places by drawing attention to key governance themes and their implications for achieving better outcomes; and (3) to work toward a fuller understanding of "deep KCP" that cautions against a tendency to view knowledge processes in coastal and marine governance settings as an instrumental or techno-managerial problem. A qualitative and reflective approach was used to examine multiple dimensions of the interplay of KCP, governance, and power in several marine and coastal contexts, including Canada, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. In particular, our analysis highlights the importance of: (1) recognizing diverse motivations that frame co-production processes; (2) the manner in which identities, positionality, and values influence and are influenced by governance contexts; (3) highlighting governance capacity with respect to spatial and temporal constraints; (4) institutional reforms necessary for KCP and the links to governance; and (5) the relationship between knowledge sharing, data sovereignty, and governance. We seek to encourage those involved in or considering co-production initiatives to engage carefully and critically in these processes and make co-production more than a box to tick.

Abstract: One of the most striking features of the economic development that has occurred in the East Asian region has been the influential role of the state in directing its course. Vietnam is also following this well-worn path of state-led developmentalism. The principal contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we place the Vietnamese experience in comparative historical and conceptual perspective. It is suggested that the structure of the Vietnamese state itself and the distinctive nature of the policies it has undertaken are reflections of the country's traumatic recent history and the fact that its leadership is notionally "communist." Our second contribution is to detail some of the more important aspects of this process. We provide two case studies which focus on the role of state-owned enterprises and decentralisation initiatives which demonstrate that, despite the frequently ad hoc and contingent nature of the developmental project and an absence of the sort of state capacity that distinguished the likes of Japan in its heyday, the Vietnamese government is overseeing economic development in creative and surprisingly effective ways.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Assessing policy analytical capacity in contemporary governments: New measures and metrics

Abstract: Assessing the policy analytical capacity (PAC) of governments has suffered in the past from the anecdotal nature of most studies, leading to different evaluations of specific analytical activities and of the overall competences and capacities of governments as a whole. What is needed to advance the field is a set of metrics that can generate insights into the capabilities of different units and how changes to their and overall government capacity develop over time. Focusing on this component of policy capacity, we map and measure the distribution of policy professionals in the provincial, territorial, and federal governments in Canada. Our measures are tested against two major findings regarding PAC: first that variation among governmental PAC varies by size of the civil service, with smaller jurisdictions likely to have less capacity, and second, that concentration of professionals in specific issue areas underscores that area's political and/or policy salience to the government concerned. Both measures prove robust in assessing Canadian government activities in these areas. Points for practitioners Policy capacity is acknowledged as a significant perquisite for policy success. While some general frameworks exist highlighting policy relevant competences and capabilities important to policy success, how to measure these remains under-investigated. Focusing on policy analytical capacity, this paper draws on the literature on policy professionals to develop two measures of this component of policy capacity linked to the extent to which an agency focuses on analysis and the proportion of their staff who work on the subject compared to other agencies. The measures are deployed in an illustrative case of Canada and Canadian governments at the territorial, provincial, and federal level which confirms their utility and robustness as indicators of the different levels of analytical capacity different agencies employ.

Abstract: If, as some have argued, private higher education is now the most dynamic segment of higher education, it is also the case that its growth, partly in response to the increasing mismatch between spiralling demand and limited state capacity, is often ad hoc. The article examines the contours of this trend in Indonesia, where the balance of public and private higher education has shifted sharply over the last two decades. While the private sector has been responsible for much of the expansion in higher education, its role in relation to quality is more questionable. Indonesia's economic burdens, sharply exacerbated by the effects of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, make it likely that the trend towards privatisation, including of its public institutions, will continue. Together with the current rise of trans-national higher education, however, this is only likely to sharpen existing difficulties around longstanding issues of quality, equality, and regulatory capacity.

Abstract: We study non-asymptotic fundamental limits for transmitting classical information over memoryless quantum channels, i.e. we investigate the amount of classical information that can be transmitted when a quantum channel is used a finite number of times and a fixed, non-vanishing average error is permissible. In this work we consider the classical capacity of quantum channels that are image-additive, including all classical to quantum channels, as well as the product state capacity of arbitrary quantum channels. In both cases we show that the non-asymptotic fundamental limit admits a second-order approximation that illustrates the speed at which the rate of optimal codes converges to the Holevo capacity as the blocklength tends to infinity. The behavior is governed by a new channel parameter, called channel dispersion, for which we provide a geometrical interpretation.

Abstract: How has social work, which has emerged as a distinct profession in the PRC with the full support of the party-state, come to produce neoliberal outcomes similar to those found in other, capitalist countries? In this article, I draw attention to the government purchase (goumai) of social work services, which is commonly considered as confirmation of state capacity and leadership rather than the passing on of state responsibilities to civil sectors with tight budgets. Ethnographic research on the actual social work practices in Shenzhen's Foxconn town reveals how neoliberal-style outsourcing has converged with diverse historical legacies, thus creating precarious labour conditions for frontline social workers. Neoliberal dynamics end up filling most of these social work positions with migrant youth from the countryside, reproducing and perpetuating China's rural-urban divide. Institutional efforts at social care may not only reduce the existing inequalities but may also rely upon and even reinforce them.

Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has imposed widespread negative impacts (economically, psychologically, neurologically, and societally), and has changed daily behaviors on a global scale. Such impacts are more significant and pervasive in countries with higher levels of inequality and reduced Government capacity and responsiveness, such as those in the Global South (e.g., Colombia). Differences in social and moral cognitive skills may significantly impact individual attitudes and responses to the pandemic. Here, we aimed to assess the extent to which factors associated with prosociality (including empathy, theory of mind (ToM), and moral judgments) predict the perception of SARS-CoV-2 impacts and responses. Participants (N = 413) from Colombia answered factors associated with prosociality measures and judgments about SARS-CoV-2 risk, impact, and acceptance of quarantine guidelines. Results revealed that affective empathy (personal distress and empathic concern) and moral tendencies (deontological trends) predicted greater acceptance of quarantine but in turn yielded an increased perception of risks and individual impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, age (older) and gender (female) also increased the risk perception and impact estimation. These results underscore the role of prosocial-related predispositions informing individual responses to the pandemic and provide an opportunity to exploit this knowledge to inform successful interventions favoring behavioral change.

Abstract: Fisheries are highly complex social-ecological systems that often face 'wicked' problems from unsustainable resource management to climate change. Addressing these challenges requires transdisciplinary approaches that integrate perspectives across scientific disciplines and knowledge systems. Despite widespread calls for transdisciplinary fisheries research (TFR), there are still limitations in personal and institutional capacity to conduct and support this work to the highest potential. The viewpoints of early career researchers (ECRs) in this field can illuminate challenges and promote systemic change within fisheries research. This paper presents the perspectives of ECRs from across the globe, gathered through a virtual workshop held during the 2021 World Fisheries Congress, on goals, challenges, and future potential for TFR. Big picture goals for TFR were guided by principles of co-production and included (i) integrating transdisciplinary thinking at all stages of the research process, (ii) ensuring that research is inclusive and equitable, (iii) co-creating knowledge that is credible, relevant, actionable, and impactful, and (iv) consistently communicating with partners. Institutional inertia, lack of recognition of the extra time and labour required for TFR, and lack of skill development opportunities were identified as three key barriers in conducting TFR. Several critical actions were identified to help ECRs, established researchers, and institutions reach these goals. We encourage ECRs to form peer-mentorship networks to guide each other along the way. We suggest that established researchers ensure consistent mentorship while also giving space to ECR voices. Actions for institutions include retooling education programs, developing and implementing new metrics of impact, and critically examining individualism and privilege in academia. We suggest that the opportunities and actions identified here, if widely embraced now, can enable research that addresses complex challenges facing fishery systems contributing to a healthier future for fish and humans alike.

Abstract: This article describes the outcomes of research into the potential of community-based mariculture of the commercial sea cucumber, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), as a sustainable livelihood in New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Around 5000 cultured juvenile sandfish were stocked in a 5-ha trial community sea ranch. The community agreed to protect the area from fishing until researchers collected technical data on sandfish performance. However, poaching of sandfish from the trial sea ranch occurred during the 2018 annual sea cucumber fishing season and no technical data were generated. Community attitudes and responses to the fishing season, the mariculture research activity and the failure of the trial sea ranch were investigated. Widespread community approval of the trial sea ranch and respect for the fishing prohibition were reported. However, it was found that poaching within the ranch escalated to extensive fishing because community-based management proved inadequate to sanction the poachers. Increased buying pressure and higher prices led to intensified fishing effort in the 2018 season. The trial sea ranch failed due to external pressures (i.e., brief, intense fishing season; limited project capacity), compounded by internal factors (i.e., weak local leadership; community disunity). It was concluded that research into and development of sandfish mariculture as a livelihood option in New Ireland Province might be impossible at this time due to the high value of sandfish, the annual sea cucumber fishing season, and ineffective governance at community, provincial and national levels. Lessons learned from this experience are presented and alternative models discussed.

Abstract: ObjectiveTo describe the mode and timing of delivery of twin pregnancies at 34weeks of gestation and their association with perinatal outcomes. DesignSecondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. PopulationTwin deliveries at 34weeks of gestation from 21 low- and middle-income countries participating in the WHO Multicountry Survey on Maternal and Newborn Health. MethodsDescriptive analysis and effect estimates using multilevel logistic regression. Main outcome measuresStillbirth, perinatal mortality, and neonatal near miss (use of selected life saving interventions at birth). ResultsThe average length of gestation at delivery was 37.6weeks. Of all twin deliveries, 16.8 and 17.6% were delivered by caesarean section before and after the onset of labour, respectively. Prelabour caesarean delivery was associated with older maternal age, higher institutional capacity and wealth of the country. Compared with spontaneous vaginal delivery, lower risks of neonatal near miss (adjusted odds ratio, aOR, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 0.44-0.94) were found among prelabour caesarean deliveries. A lower risk of early neonatal mortality (aOR0.12; 95% CI 0.02-0.56) was also observed among prelabour caesarean deliveries with nonvertex presentation of the first twin. The week of gestation with the lowest rate of prospective fetal death varied by fetal presentation: 37weeks for vertex-vertex; 39weeks for vertex-nonvertex; and 38weeks for a nonvertex first twin. ConclusionsThe prelabour caesarean delivery rate among twins varied largely between countries, probably as a result of overuse of caesarean delivery in wealthier countries and limited access to caesarean delivery in low-income countries. Prelabour delivery may be beneficial when the first twin is nonvertex. International guidelines for optimal twin delivery methods are needed.

Objective: To better understand the influence of stakeholders in accelerating UHIC to achieve equity in health care. Design: Using a qualitative study design, we conducted content analysis of HI-related documents and interviewed social security and health system key informants, government representatives, and community stakeholders to determine their positions and influence on UHIC. Results: Our findings demonstrate different levels of support of stakeholders that influence in the HI formulation and implementation, from opposition when HI was first introduced in 1989 to collaboration of stakeholders from 2013 when the Master Plan for UHIC was implemented. Despite an initial failure to secure the support of the Parliament for a Law on HI, a subsequent series of alternative legislative strategies brought limited increases in HI coverage. With government financial subsidization, the involvement of multiple stakeholders, political commitment, and flexible working mechanisms among stakeholders have remained important, with an increasing recognition that HI is not only a technical aspect of the health system but also a broader socioeconomic and governance issue. The different levels of power and influence among stakeholders, together with their commercial and political interests and their different perceptions of HI, have influenced stakeholders' support or opposition to HI policies. Conclusions: Despite high-level policy support, stakeholders' positions may vary, depending on their perceptions of the policy Implications. A shift in government stakeholder positions, especially at the provincial level, has been necessary to accelerate UHIC progress and build institutional capacity.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Venue Shopping and Legitimacy: Making Sense of Harper's Immigration Record

Abstract: Canadian immigration policies went through numerous changes under the Conservative party leadership of Stephen Harper from 2006 to 2015. This article provides an empirical account of immigration policy change during this era and suggests that of state-centred venue shopping can effectively account for the Harper's immigration record. In particular, it documents the ways in which immigration policies have expanded into international and regional venues, opened new venues to non-state actors, further decentralized into subnational venues and reinvested into traditional administrative and executive venues for policy making. The analysis suggests that the redeployment of the state into new and expanding venues aims to demonstrate state capacity and legitimacy as a nodal actor in immigration policy. ResumeCet article presente une analyse empirique des changements aux politiques liees a l'immigration effectuees par le gouvernement de Stephen Harper entre 2006 et 2015. Plutot que de presenter ces changements comme s'expliquant uniquement par le neoliberalisme ou l' ideologies conservatrice, cet article propose qu'ils doivent etre compris comme des indicateurs de deplacement des lieux de prises de decision et de mise en oeuvre des politiques d'immigration du Canada. Par le biais du concept de venue shopping, l'analyse empirique demontre que les changements de politique d'immigration sous Harper ont implique l'expansion vers des institutions regionales et internationales, l'inclusion d'acteurs non etatiques, la decentralisation, mais aussi le renforcement des capacites des detenteurs du pouvoir executif. L'analyse suggere que ces redeploiements sont motives par un desir de demontrer et de maintenir la legitimite et la capacite de l'Etat canadien a etre l'acteur central dans la gouvernance des politiques d'immigration au pays.

Abstract: In the West, limited government capacity to solve environmental problems has triggered the rise of a variety of "nonstate actors" to supplement government efforts or provide alternative mechanisms for addressing environmental issues. How does this development - along with our efforts to understand it map onto environmental governance processes in China? China's efforts to address environmental issues reflect institutionalized governance processes that differ from parallel western processes in ways that have major consequences for domestic environmental governance practices and the governance of China "going abroad." China's governance processes blur the distinction between the state and other actors; the "shadow of the state" is a major factor in all efforts to address environmental issues. The space occupied by nonstate actors in western systems is occupied by shiye danwei ("public service units"), she hui tuanti ("social associations") and e-platforms, all of which have close links to the state. Meanwhile, international NGOs and multinational corporations are also significant players in China. As a result, the mechanisms of influence that produce effects in China differ in important ways from mechanisms familiar from the western experience. This conclusion has far-reaching implications for those seeking to address global environmental concerns, given the importance of China's growing economy and burgeoning network of trade relationships.

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) put substantial stress on loco-regional resources, and trauma centers are critical to responding to these events. Our previous evaluation of Canadian centers helped to identify several weaknesses in disaster responsiveness. In this analysis, we determined the current state of MCI readiness across Canada and how this has changed over time. A multinational cross-sectional survey-based study on MCI preparedness was performed, including 24 Canadian trauma centers. Surveys were completed anonymously online by representatives of each facility. Responses from Canadian centers were examined and compared to previous findings to assess temporal changes in institutional capacity. Fifteen (63%) trauma centers responded, 100% of which had a disaster committee. Sixty percent had a single all-hazards emergency plan, and 71% performed a practice drill in the last two years. Sixty-two percent had communications systems designed to function during an MCI. Ninety-two percent had a triage system in place, and 54% of centers could monitor surge capacity. Half (54%) reported back-up systems for survival essentials, but the capability for prolonged operation during a disaster was limited. A minority (15%) had a database denoting staff with emergency training, although half (54%) had disaster training programs. Comparison to past data showed an increased prevalence of committees dedicated to disaster preparedness and disaster drills but worsened external stakeholder representation and poor ability to provide a prolonged response to crises. Our results demonstrate that MCI preparedness is a growing focus of Canadian trauma centers, but that there are deficiencies that remain unaddressed. Future efforts should focus on these vulnerabilities to ensure the provision of a robust disaster response.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Legitimacy and Disaster: Responses to the 1932 Floods in North Manchuria

Abstract: The very existence of the new state of Manchukuo was contested throughout the 1930s. Despite its colonial reality, its form as a nation-state necessitated an attempt to generate legitimacy, and its best hope lay in performance legitimacy as a modernizing and developmental state delivering public goods and offering honest and efficient government. Less than a year after its establishment, the new state faced a crisis caused by large-scale floods in the north of the region. This article examines how it attempted to build performance legitimacy even in a quasi-colonial situation by establishing institutions and raising funds to mount a relief effort, providing food, shelter, and medical care, and in the longer term restoring state capacity by maintaining order, reopening communications, and instituting flood prevention measures. At the same time, it generated a narrative that linked that effort to its broader ideological claims to legitimacy.

Abstract: Stresses associated with effects of climate change, including rise in relative mean sea level, present one set of threats to mangroves. Coastal development and ecosystems in the Pacific Islands region are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. We investigated the capacity of Pacific Island countries and territories to assess mangrove vulnerability to the effects of climate change, and their capacity to adapt to mangrove responses to these forces. Technical and institutional capacity-building priorities include: (1) strengthening management frameworks to conduct site-specific assessment of mangrove vulnerability and incorporate resulting information into land-use plans to prepare for any landward mangrove migration and offsetting anticipated losses; (2) reducing and eliminating stresses on and rehabilitating mangroves, in part, to increase mangrove resilience to climate change effects; and (3) augmenting abilities to establish mangrove baselines, and monitor gradual changes using standardized techniques through a regional network to distinguish local and climate change effects on mangroves. Other priorities are to: (4) assess how mangrove margins have changed over recent decades; (5) determine projections of trends in mean relative sea level and trends in the frequency and elevation of extreme high water events; (6) measure trends in changes in elevations of mangrove surfaces; and (7) incorporate this information into land-use planning processes. Also in (8) some locations require spatial imagery showing topography and locations of mangroves and coastal development. Land-use planners can use information from assessments predicting shoreline responses to projected sea level rise and other climate change effects to reduce risks to coastal development, human safety, and coastal ecosystems. This advanced planning enables coastal managers to minimize social disruption and cost, minimize losses of valued coastal ecosystems, and maximize available options.

Abstract: It is widely held in the public policy and political economy literatures that the Turkish state is weak and cannot adopt a proactive approach in the financial services industry by steering and coordinating the financial policy network. However, it is puzzling that this seemingly "weak" Turkish state, which is often marked by fragmentation, conflict, and a lack of policy coordination within the state apparatus, acted strongly between 2010 and 2016 by taking pre-emptive measures to contain the macrofinancial risks arising from hot money inflows and bank credit expansion. Examining the organizational policy capacity of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, this article argues that proactive policy design and implementation are more likely to complement state capacity when the principal bureaucratic actors have strong organizational policy capacities.

Abstract: This paper argues that despite Indonesia's implementation of public sector reforms, the impact of these reforms has yet to achieve the goal of improving governance and preventing corruption. The obvious place to lay blame would be a lack of state capacity, but this study presents evidence to argue that the legacy of General Suharto's authoritarian regime and the cultural ecology of Indonesian bureaucracy has compromised the government's capacity to implement these public sector reforms in a meaningful way. IMPACT This paper highlights some fundamental points for public policy-makers using NPM techniques to improve accountability and to counter fraud. First, the cultural context and costs of reforms should be taken into account before implementing new accounting technology. Second, policy-makers should consult academic work on the implementation of new reporting systems and other NPM policies. Finally, the powers of local politicians (for example mayors or district heads) need to be controlled to ensure they do not undermine the role of accounting and auditing for better transparency, governance and corruption eradication.

Abstract: A thorough understanding of livelihoods is necessary to ensure development policies are compatible with both resource conservation and the social and economic goals of development. Few studies, however, focus on value-adding activities occurring post-harvest in artisanal fisheries. The transformation of mollusc shells and skeletal remains of other marine taxa into artistic jewellery and decorative items is becoming an increasingly important livelihood activity for rural, coastal communities across the Pacific. We examine the potential challenges facing the shell-based handicraft sector and opportunities for overcoming these challenges using a quantitative study of artisans among the Tigak Islands of Papua New Guinea. The major challenges facing this livelihood sector are perceptions of marine resource declines and a lack of livelihood flexibility, attributed to the specialisation of material assets and skills. Improving market heterogeneity and developing coastal aquaculture may facilitate sustainable development of this livelihood sector.

Abstract: Healthcare workers involved in aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheal intubation, may be at elevated risk of acquiring COVID-19. However, the magnitude of this risk is unknown. We conducted a prospective international multicentre cohort study recruiting healthcare workers participating in tracheal intubation of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Information on tracheal intubation episodes, personal protective equipment use and subsequent provider health status was collected via self-reporting. The primary endpoint was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or new symptoms requiring self-isolation or hospitalisation after a tracheal intubation episode. Cox regression analysis examined associations between the primary endpoint and healthcare worker characteristics, procedure-related factors and personal protective equipment use. Between 23 March and 2 June 2020, 1718 healthcare workers from 503 hospitals in 17 countries reported 5148 tracheal intubation episodes. The overall incidence of the primary endpoint was 10.7% over a median (IQR [range]) follow-up of 32 (18-48 [0-116]) days. The cumulative incidence within 7, 14 and 21 days of the first tracheal intubation episode was 3.6%, 6.1% and 8.5%, respectively. The risk of the primary endpoint varied by country and was higher in women, but was not associated with other factors. Around 1 in 10 healthcare workers involved in tracheal intubation of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 subsequently reported a COVID-19 outcome. This has human resource implications for institutional capacity to deliver essential healthcare services, and wider societal implications for COVID-19 transmission.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Cyclic Capacity of Monopiles in Sand under Partially Drained Conditions: A Numerical Approach

Abstract: Cyclic loading of saturated sand under partially drained conditions may lead to accumulated strains, pore pressure buildup, and consequently reduced effective stress, stiffness, and shear strength. This will affect the ultimate limit state capacity of monopile foundations in sand for offshore wind turbines. This paper calculates the performance of large-diameter monopile foundations, which are installed in uniform dense sand, subjected to storm loading using the partially drained cyclic accumulation model (PDCAM). The simultaneous pore pressure accumulation and dissipation is accounted for by fully coupled pore water flow and stress equilibrium (consolidation) finite element analyses. Drainage and cyclic load effects on monopile behavior are studied by comparing the PDCAM simulation results with simulation results using a hardening soil model with small strain stiffness. At the end, a simplified procedure of PDCAM, named PDCAM-S, is proposed, and the results using this approach together with PLAXIS 3D and the NGI-ADP soil model are compared with the PDCAM results.

Abstract: The success of mariculture activities involving the release of cultured marine invertebrates into the ocean is contingent on high survival and appropriate growth rates. Physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics that differ from those of wild conspecifics may be acquired through hatchery rearing, or as a result of stress induced by the release process. Such differences may compromise the 'fitness' of cultured animals. We investigated the influence of hatchery rearing and transport/handling stress on a commercial sea cucumber, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), by comparing survival, growth and behavior of release-size (5-15 g) cultured juveniles to those of like-size wild conspecifics. At the conclusion of an 85-day growth experiment in natural habitat, there was no significant difference in weight between cultured and wild sandfish juveniles. Burying behavior of cultured and wild sandfish juveniles was observed over a 48-h period in natural habitat with or without seagrass. A generalized additive model showed that cultured juveniles were slower to bury in the substrate after release, less likely to be buried at most times, and more likely to be buried in substrate where seagrass was present. However, they became better synchronized with their wild counterparts after 30 h. Survival of cultured and wild sandfish was high in both experiments (> 85%), but reduced burying by cultured individuals may increase the potential for predation because diel burying is the main predator avoidance strategy of sandfish juveniles.

Abstract: The implementation of international law requires State capacity, including knowledge of treaties and institutions by domestic officials. The training of State officials is often delivered by an international organisation, agency or secretariat as part of the capacity-building programmes required by the treaty that each administers. Yet, of the increasingly urgent calls for international cooperation to address climate change, biodiversity crises, public health threats and plastic pollution, among other issues, not one can be addressed by a single treaty or international organisation. The practical, operational and theoretical challenges of coordination deserve more attention by international lawyers. This is especially important given the development of pandemic-era remote learning technologies and the proliferation of e-learning opportunities. Disparities in resources, and the categorisation of developing and developed countries, further complicates the production and dissemination of knowledge. This article focuses on capacity-building, technical assistance and training, and includes the author's experience with collaborative training initiatives in ocean governance, to which United Nations agencies, the World Bank and academic partners contribute. The article describes the high stakes of integrative initiatives, the outreach by international organisations and the interaction between regimes. It seeks to account for collaborative capacity-building activities and the adaptive role of participants within the system of international law.

Abstract: A case study report of the good practices of the Sri Lankan Early Warning System (EWS) was prepared for the ANDROID Disaster Resilience Network funded by the EU Lifelong Learning Programme. The objective was to highlight good practices, identify gaps and useful recommendations (within an up-to-date and comprehensive context) to achieve disaster resilient governance. The EWS components; Infrastructure, Risk Knowledge (i.e. Hazard, Vulnerability and Risk Assessment), Preparedness and Early Warning Dissemination, Disaster Response and Coordination were scrutinised. These components were compared against the exemplary structure of a people-centred EWS to assess its efficacy in achieving disaster resilience. Since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami was the first contemporary large-scale disaster faced by Sri Lanka, it lacked the legislative framework and institutional capacity to respond and only thereafter the integration of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) was observed. The importance of training was demonstrated within risk knowledge, preparedness and early warning dissemination, and disaster response and coordination. Thereby training is considered crucial in achieving a progressive, people-centred EWS. However it can be consolidated through joint resource utilisation (particularly personnel) between organisations and creating a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) certification system. There has been considerable progress in integrating DRR into development at all levels, which is a key measure in achieving disaster resilience. It was notably observed in achieving disaster resilient development, climate change adaptation and DRR was integrated despite a general tendency to be polarised in other areas. Despite some existing projects there is a need for greater government and private sector engagement in ecosystem-based DRR. Finally to achieve a disaster resilient Sri Lankan EWS, risk transfer measures require further evaluation. The emergence of some disaster risk financing and insurance is observed but issues, such as assuring applicability to a local context and scientific, evidence-based underpinning, need to be addressed.

Abstract: This paper proposes that societies with a rice farming legacy tend to be less democratic today than societies with a wheat farming legacy. We argue that rice cultivation is associated with the adoption of a collectivist culture, which in turn fosters greater conformity pressures on political norms and deters democratization. Conversely, a wheat farming legacy leads to the development of individualism, which in turn promotes democracy. Using the rice-wheat suitability ratio for a sample of 146 countries as an exogenous variable for rice farming culture, we find that the rice-wheat suitability ratio is a deep-rooted determinant for the formation of democratic institutions through a culture of collectivism vs. individualism.

Abstract: IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed health systems, resulting in a surge in excess deaths. This study clustered countries based on excess mortality to understand their response to the pandemic and the influence of various factors on excess mortality within each cluster.Materials and MethodsThis ecological study is part of the COVID-19 MORtality (C-MOR) Consortium. Mortality data were gathered from 21 countries and were previously used to calculate weekly all-cause excess mortality. Thirty exposure variables were considered in five categories as factors potentially associated with excess mortality: population factors, health care resources, socioeconomic factors, air pollution, and COVID-19 policy. Estimation of Latent Class Linear Mixed Model (LCMM) was used to cluster countries based on response trajectory and Generalized Linear Mixture Model (GLMM) for each cluster was run separately.ResultsUsing LCMM, two clusters were reached. Among 21 countries, Brazil, the USA, Georgia, and Poland were assigned to a separate cluster, with the mean of excess mortality z-score in 2020 and 2021 around 4.4, compared to 1.5 for all other countries assigned to the second cluster. In both clusters the population incidence of COVID-19 had the greatest positive relationship with excess mortality while interactions between the incidence of COVID-19, fully vaccinated people, and stringency index were negatively associated with excess mortality. Moreover, governmental variables (government revenue and government effectiveness) were the most protective against excess mortality.ConclusionThis study highlighted that clustering countries based on excess mortality can provide insights to gain a broader understanding of countries' responses to the pandemic and their effectiveness.

Abstract: We examine the effect of sectarian politics in the presence of weak state capacity on long-term economic growth. To this end, we exploit the 1956 civil uprising between Maronite Christian and Sunni Muslim factions in Lebanon to estimate the impact of sectarian political tensions on long-term growth. To isolate the impact of the uprising, we use synthetic control estimator and match Lebanon's pre-1956 growth and development trajectory with the rest of the world where such uprising did not occur, and estimate the counterfactual growth trajectory in the hypothetical absence of the sectarian conflict. Our evidence indicates large and pervasive negative growth effects of factionalism. Our estimates imply that Lebanon's per capita income down to the present day is on average 57% lower than that of its pre-1956 synthetic control group without sectarian clashes, and does not seem to be driven by preexisting or subsequent trends and shocks. The negative long-term growth effect of sectarian conflict is robust to a battery of spatial and temporal placebo checks, choice of samples and is not sensitive to the composition of control groups.

Abstract: Background: Segmented service delivery with consequent inefficiencies in health systems was one of the main concerns raised during scaling up of disease-specific programs in the last two decades. The organized response to NCD is in infancy in most LMICs with little evidence on how the response is evolving in terms of institutional arrangements and policy development processes. Methods: Drawing on qualitative review of policy and program documents from five LMICs and data from global key-informant surveys conducted in 2004 and 2010, we examine current status of governance of response to NCDs at national level along three dimensions-institutional arrangements for stewardship and program management and implementation; policies/plans; and multisectoral coordination and partnerships. Results: Several positive trends were noted in the organization and governance of response to NCDs: shift from specific NCD-based programs to integrated NCD programs, increasing inclusion of NCDs in sector-wide health plans, and establishment of high-level multisectoral coordination mechanisms. Several areas of concern were identified. The evolving NCD-specific institutional structures are being treated as 'program management and implementation' entities rather than as lead 'technical advisory' bodies, with unclear division of roles and responsibilities between NCD-specific and sector-wide structures. NCD-specific and sector-wide plans are poorly aligned and lack prioritization, costing, and appropriate targets. Finally, the effectiveness of existing multisectoral coordination mechanisms remains questionable. Conclusions: The 'technical functions' and 'implementation and management functions' should be clearly separated between NCD-specific units and sector-wide institutional structures to avoid duplicative segmented service delivery systems. Institutional capacity building efforts for NCDs should target both NCD-specific units (for building technical and analytical capacity) and sector-wide organizational units (for building program management and implementation capacity) in MOH. The sector-wide health plans should reflect NCDs in proportion to their public health importance. NCD specific plans should be developed in close consultation with sector-wide health- and non-health stakeholders. These plans should expand on the directions provided by sector-wide health plans specifying strategically prioritized, fully costed activities, and realistic quantifiable targets for NCD control linked with sector-wide expenditure framework. Multisectoral coordination mechanisms need to be strengthened with optimal decision-making powers and resource commitment and monitoring of their outputs.

Abstract: This paper describes a method of the refined plastic hinge approach in the framework of the higher-order element formulation that can efficaciously evaluate the limit state capacity of a whole reinforced concrete structural system using least number of element(s), whereas the traditional design of a reinforced concrete structure (i.e. AS3600; Eurocode 2) is member-based approach. Hence, in regard to the material nonlinearities, the efficient and economical cross-section analysis is provided to evaluate the element section capacity of non-uniform and arbitrary concrete section subjected to the interaction effects, which is helpful to formulate the refined plastic hinge method. In regard to the geometric nonlinearities, this paper relies on the higher-order element formulation with element load effect. Eventually, the load redistribution can be considered and make full use of the strength reserved owing to the redundancy of an indeterminate structure. And it is particularly true for the performance-based design of a structure under the extreme loads, while the uncertainty of the extreme load is great that the true behaviour of a whole structural system is important for the economical design approach, which is great superiority over the conservative optimal strength of an individual and isolated member based on traditional design (i.e. AS3600; Eurocode 2).

Abstract: Over the years, the chemical market has shown significant growth, but the hazardous impact of chemical use and disposal on the environment and human health is a growing concern. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are among the most dangerous chemicals with widespread effects on the environment and living organisms, including humans. This study aimed to assess the current status of POP management and regulatory infrastructure in Ethiopia by collecting information from stakeholders responsible for recording the import, export, use, management, and regulation of POPs both in government and private sectors. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review was conducted using Boolean operators from international databases and libraries. The results indicated that Ethiopia banned the import of pesticides listed under Annex A (i.e., those to be eliminated), except endosulfan, which was imported at a quantity of 199,767 kg lt(-1) from 2011 to 2015. There are 2,435 PCB-containing transformers in Ethiopia, of which 2,242 (92%) are currently in use. These transformers and capacitors contain 1,031,661 kg and 1,255 kg of dielectric fluids, respectively. As for Annex B POPs (i.e., those to be restricted), there are between 928,509 kg and 1,383,095 kg of active and obsolete dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane found in different stores across the country. Ethiopia imported approximately 337,000 kg of products containing perfluorooctane sulfonic acid from 2000 to 2020, with an annual average of 16,850 kg of photographic film, paper, and plates. POPs were also detected in different environmental matrices (soil, waterbodies, sediments, food items, and air) as well as human blood. Despite these findings, regulation and management of POP waste and stockpiles are largely inadequate in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the monitoring, management, and regulation of POPs in the country. This could be achieved by strengthening the collaboration among different regulatory bodies, harmonizing the fragmented laws on POP management and control, and building institutional capacity.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Assessing the Cost of Global Biodiversity and Conservation Knowledge

Abstract: Knowledge products comprise assessments of authoritative information supported by standards, governance, quality control, data, tools, and capacity building mechanisms. Considerable resources are dedicated to developing and maintaining knowledge products for biodiversity conservation, and they are widely used to inform policy and advise decision makers and practitioners. However, the financial cost of delivering this information is largely undocumented. We evaluated the costs and funding sources for developing and maintaining four global biodiversity and conservation knowledge products: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, Protected Planet, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. These are secondary data sets, built on primary data collected by extensive networks of expert contributors worldwide. We estimate that US$160 million (range: US$116-204 million), plus 293 person-years of volunteer time (range: 278308 person-years) valued at US$14 million (range US$12-16 million), were invested in these four knowledge products between 1979 and 2013. More than half of this financing was provided through philanthropy, and nearly three-quarters was spent on personnel costs. The estimated annual cost of maintaining data and platforms for three of these knowledge products (excluding the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems for which annual costs were not possible to estimate for 2013) is US$6.5 million in total (range: US$6.2-6.7 million). We estimated that an additional US$114 million will be needed to reach pre-defined baselines of data coverage for all the four knowledge products, and that once achieved, annual maintenance costs will be approximately US$12 million. These costs are much lower than those to maintain many other, similarly important, global knowledge products. Ensuring that biodiversity and conservation knowledge products are sufficiently up to date, comprehensive and accurate is fundamental to inform decision-making for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Thus, the development and implementation of plans for sustainable long-term financing for them is critical.

Abstract: Small-scale fisheries provide many benefits to coastal communities in the Indo-Pacific region, including food security, improved nutrition and cash income. However, increasing engagement with the global economy is exerting additional pressure on marine resources and opportunities to engage in alternative livelihoods are often limited by remoteness and a lack of land-based farming opportunities. Beche-de-mer, the dried body wall of sea cucumber, is a valuable marine export commodity in the region, and an important cash-earning activity in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Sea cucumber mariculture (or holothuriculture), based on the high-value species, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), is also a promising community livelihood. Overfishing of sea cucumber in PNG led the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) to impose a moratorium on the fishery in October 2009. The fishery was reopened in 2017 for less than two months. This article presents socioeconomic data generated before, during and after the 2017 sea cucumber fishing season in three villages in New Ireland Province, PNG, which are also partners in a community-based sandfish mariculture project. The fishery dominated the economies of all three communities while it was open. Increased income was accompanied by high consumption of store-bought foods and purchase of other assets intended to increase living standards. Drawing on current understandings of local culture and political economy, together with the results from the 2017 wild sea cucumber fishery, we discuss how a livelihood based on holothuriculture could coexist with the wild fishery to increase benefits to coastal communities in PNG.

Abstract: This paper reports methodology for large-scale hatchery culture of sandfish, Holothuria scabra, in the absence of live, cultured micro-algae. We demonstrate how commercially-available micro-algae concentrates can be incorporated into hatchery protocols as the sole larval food source to completely replace live, cultured microalgae. Micro-algae concentrates supported comparable hatchery production of sandfish to that of live, cultured micro-algae traditionally used in large-scale hatchery culture. The hatchery protocol presented allowed a single technician to achieve production of more than 18,800 juvenile sandfish at 40 days post-fertilisation in a low-resource hatchery in Papua New Guinea. Growth of auricularia larvae fed micro-algae concentrates was represented by the equation length (mu m) = 307.8 x ln(day) + 209.2 (R-2 = 0.93) while survival over the entire 40 day hatchery cycle was described by the equation survival = 2 x day(-1.06) (R-2 = 0.74). These results show that micro-algae concentrates have great potential for simplifying hatchery culture of sea cucumbers by reducing infrastructural and technical resources required for live micro-algae culture. The hatchery methodology described in this study is likely to have applicability to low-resource hatcheries throughout the Indo-Pacific and could support regional expansion of sandfish hatchery production.

Abstract: Introduction: The vaccine vial monitor (VVM) registers cumulative heat exposure on vaccines over time. As low- and lower-middle-income countries transition beyond support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), they will assume full responsibility for vaccine financing and procurement. It is unclear to what extent countries transitioning out of Gavi support will continue to include VVMs on their vaccines. This paper aims to systematically review evidence on WM availability and use in low- and middle-income countries to document factors behind global access to and country demand for VVMs. Such results could help identify actions needed to ensure continued use of VVMs in countries that transition out of Gavi support. Methods: We performed a systematic review of electronic databases, reference lists, and grey literature in English and French languages with publication dates from 2005 onwards. The studies included were analyzed for the following outcomes: (1) availability and deployment of VVM-labeled vaccines; (2) WM practices and perceptions in the immunization system; (3) vaccine introduction and decision-making processes; (4) Gavi graduation and vaccine program sustainability. Results: The study found that VVM availability and use was affected by multiple sourcing of vaccines and the extent to which WM was included in the vaccine specification in the tendering documents when procuring vaccines. Knowledge about VVM and its impact on the EPI program was found to be high among health workers as well as decision-makers. However, the study also found that weak capacity in key national institutions such as NRA and NPA might impact on demand for WM. As countries take decisions regarding the adoption of new vaccines, factors such as disease burden and vaccine price may assume greater importance than vaccine characteristics and presentation. Finally, the study found that countries rely largely on the advice and recommendations from technical partners such as WHO and PAHO. Conclusion: The study concludes that global access to and country demand for VVM are dependent on policy statements and recommendations about VVM by key policy institutions such as WHO and UNICEF. The study also concludes that despite Gavi-eligible countries having access to WM-labeled vaccines, inclusion is often below 100%. Weak institutional capacity in key national agencies such as NRA and NPA seems to be a contributing factor, while other factors include the procurement of clear national policies on the inclusion of VVM on vaccines, along with the capacity to enforce the policy. Finally, the study concludes that knowledge about VVM and its impact on vaccine program efficiency, safety, and cost is critical for transitioning countries' continuous demand for WM.

Abstract: Bordering practices have been a central and controversial feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Closed borders, lockdowns, and restrictions on movement and individual "freedoms" have revived concepts of the biopolitical "state of exception" and state control. In this article, we argue that biopolitical critiques of responses to the pandemic fail to grasp the opportunity to rethink worldmaking and instead base their critiques on a desired "return to normal" which foregrounds human-centric individualism at the expense of alternative worldmaking that accounts for the more-than-human. To do so, we bring the virus and the virome into our discussion to rethink bordering practices and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects bodies, worlds, and politics. We focus primarily on the Australian case, where the pandemic response began with lockdowns and then gave way to a militarized and individualistic approach. Responses to the pandemic have failed to produce a reimagining of human and more-than-human relations. Opportunities for ethical engagement have been missed, resulting in limited responses that stem from the failure of state capacity and entrenched modes of inequality that are harmful to vulnerable others, both human and more-than-human. This requires an ontological reframing of how we relate to a complex world from a more-than-human perspective. Les pratiques relatives aux frontieres constituaient une caracteristique decisive mais controversee de la pandemie de SARS-CoV-2. La fermeture des frontieres, les confinements et les restrictions des mouvements et des << libertes individuelles >> ont fait renaitre les concepts d'<< etat d'exception >> biopolitique et de controle de l'etat. Dans cet article, nous affirmons que les critiques biopolitiques des mesures liees a la pandemie ne saisissent pas l'opportunite de repenser la conception du monde, et fondent davantage leurs critiques sur le << retour a la normale >> souhaite, qui met en avant l'individualisme anthropocentrique, plutot qu'une autre conception du monde qui prendrait en compte le plus qu'humain. Pour ce faire, nous introduisons le virus et le virome dans notre discussion pour repenser les pratiques relatives aux frontieres et les effets du virus SARS-CoV-2 sur les corps, les mondes et la politique. Nous nous concentrons principalement sur le cas australien, ou la reponse a la pandemie a debute par des confinements, puis a laisse place a une approche militarisee et individualiste. Les mesures prises pendant la pandemie n'ont pas reimagine les relations humaines et plus qu'humaines. Nous avons manque les opportunites d'engagement ethique, ce qui a limite nos reponses a cause de l'incapacite des etats et des modes d'inegalites tenaces, nocifs pour les autres vulnerables, tant humains que plus qu'humains. Aussi est-il necessaire de resituer sur le plan ontologique notre relation a un monde complexe d'apres une perspective plus qu'humaines. Las practicas fronterizas han sido una caracteristica importante y controvertida de la pandemia de SARS-CoV-2. Los cierres de fronteras, los confinamientos y las restricciones a la circulacion y a las << libertades >> individuales han revivido los conceptos del << estado de excepcion >> biopolitico y el control estatal. En este articulo argumentamos que las criticas biopoliticas a las respuestas contra la pandemia no aprovechan la oportunidad de repensar la construccion del mundo y, en cambio, basan sus criticas en un deseado << retorno a la normalidad >> que pone en primer plano el individualismo centrado en el ser humano a expensas de la creacion de mundos alternativos que tienen en cuenta mas de lo que es el ser humano. Para ello, utilizamos tanto el virus como el viroma en nuestra discusion con el fin de repensar las practicas fronterizas y como el virus SARS-CoV-2 afecta a los organismos, a los mundos y a la politica. Nos centramos principalmente en el caso australiano, donde la respuesta a la pandemia comenzo con confinamientos y, a continuacion, dio paso a un enfoque militarizado e individualista. Las respuestas a la pandemia no han logrado producir una reinvencion de las relaciones humanas y mas que humanas. En consecuencia, se han perdido oportunidades para lograr un compromiso etico, lo que ha dado lugar a respuestas limitadas que se derivan del fracaso de la capacidad del Estado y de modos arraigados de desigualdad que son perjudiciales para otros seres vulnerables, tanto humanos como mas que humanos. Esto requiere un replanteamiento ontologico de como nos relacionamos con un mundo complejo desde una perspectiva mas que humana.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Exploring the Scope of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome Therapy and Care: Engagement of Non-Critical Care Providers and Survivors in a Second Stakeholders Meeting

Abstract: Background: Increasing numbers of survivors of critical illness are at risk for physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that may persist for months or years after hospital discharge. The post-intensive care syndrome framework encompassing these multidimensional morbidities was developed at the 2010 Society of Critical Care Medicine conference on improving long-term outcomes after critical illness for survivors and their families. Objectives: To report on engagement with non-critical care providers and survivors during the 2012 Society of Critical Care Medicine post-intensive care syndrome stakeholder conference. Task groups developed strategies and resources required for raising awareness and education, understanding and addressing barriers to clinical practice, and identifying research gaps and resources, aimed at improving patient and family outcomes. Participants: Representatives from 21 professional associations or health systems involved in the provision of both critical care and rehabilitation of ICU survivors in the United States and ICU survivors and family members. Design: Stakeholder consensus meeting. Researchers presented summaries on morbidities for survivors and their families, whereas survivors presented their own experiences. Meeting Outcomes: Future steps were planned regarding 1) recognizing, preventing, and treating post-intensive care syndrome, 2) building strategies for institutional capacity to support and partner with survivors and families, and 3) understanding and addressing barriers to practice. There was recognition of the need for systematic and frequent assessment for post-intensive care syndrome across the continuum of care, including explicit "functional reconciliation" (assessing gaps between a patient's pre-ICU and current functional ability at all intra- and interinstitutional transitions of care). Future post-intensive care syndrome research topic areas were identified across the continuum of recovery: characterization of at-risk patients (including recognizing risk factors, mechanisms of injury, and optimal screening instruments), prevention and treatment interventions, and outcomes research for patients and families. Conclusions: Raising awareness of post-intensive care syndrome for the public and both critical care and non-critical care clinicians will inform a more coordinated approach to treatment and support during recovery after critical illness. Continued conceptual development and engagement with additional stakeholders is required.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Typhoon disaster politics in pre-1945 Asia: three case studies

Abstract: Purpose This paper focuses on the adaptations societies make to climate-related disasters. How they learnt from them in the past should indicate how they will respond in the more climate-stressed future. National typhoon disaster politics arise when citizens demand disaster protection from their state. Design/methodology/approach The paper analyzes one episode of typhoon politics in each of three Asian countries before 1945: the Philippines (1928), India (1942) and Japan (1934). These three countries show high variance in state capacity and level of democracy. Discourse data are found in contemporary newspaper accounts. Findings In each case, the typhoon disaster politics were shaped by the "distance" (geographical, institutional, class and cultural) between citizen-victims and the state. Where that distance was great (rural Philippines, Bengal-India), the state tended to minimise victimhood. Where it was small (urban Japan), adaptation was serious and rapid. Social implications The findings should stimulate public discussion of the way in which past social relations and power dynamics surrounding climate-related disasters might influence the present. As the political character of climate change adaptation grows clearer, so does the need for debate to be well-informed. Originality/value Most historical work on climate-related disasters has focused either on the natural phenomena, or on their societal impact. The present paper's focus on adaptation is part of a small but growing scholarly effort to bend the debate towards the evolution of adaptive capacity.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Does Selective Mechanisation Make up for Labour Shortages in Rural Myanmar?

Abstract: In Myanmar's rural areas, a high proportion of the landless population is traditionally linked with landholders as farm labour. More recently, however, these linkages seem to be unravelling due to the emergence of new industries and increased urbanisation creating new opportunities outside of the agricultural sector. While agricultural development schemes encourage intensified agricultural production and mechanization, labour shortages increasingly arise at peak cropping periods. Landholders respond with farm mechanization that reduces labour requirement. Based on household surveys and focus group discussions in the Ayeyarwady Delta (AD) and Central Dry Zone (CDZ) regions of Myanmar, this paper examines the extent of labour shortages in crop production and the efficiency of farm mechanization in response to labour shortfalls. Data show that only a small percentage of landless households in either region rely on agricultural labour alone. Instead we can observe a shift towards more diverse livelihood portfolios and non-farm work. This trend further amplifies labour shortages and leads to production loss. Most farm machines, however, substitute animal power but cannot replace human labour sufficiently to make up for the shortages. Moreover, landholders suffer from the inadequate quality of farm machines and high maintenance cost. The paper highlights farm labour shortage as a result of non-farm development and argues that farm mechanisation projects are ineffective without concomitant infrastructure and services development.

Abstract: Introduction Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and disability are major global health issues. Although they can cause and influence each other, data on their co-existence are sparse. We aimed to describe the prevalence and patterns of disability among a cohort of children with SAM. Methods A longitudinal cohort study in Malawi followed SAM survivors up to 7 years postdischarge. Clinical and anthropometric profiles were compared with sibling and community controls. Disability at original admission was identified clinically; at 7-year follow-up a standardised screening tool called 'the Washington Group Questionnaire' was used. Results 60/938 (6.4%) of admissions to SAM treatment had clinically obvious disability at admission. Post-treatment mortality was high, with only 11/60 (18%) surviving till 7-year follow-up. SAM children with a disability at admission had 6.99 (95% CI 3.49 to 14.02; p<0.001) greater risk of dying compared with children without disability. They were also older, less likely to be HIV positive or have oedema and more severely malnourished. Long-term survivors were more stunted, had less catch-up growth, smaller head circumference, weaker hand grip strength and poorer school achievement than non-disabled survivors. The Washington Group Questionnaire confirmed disability in all who had been identified clinically, and identified many who had not been previously flagged. Conclusion Disability is common among children affected by SAM. Those with disability-associated SAM have greatly increased risk of dying even if they survive the initial episode of malnutrition. Survivors have poorer growth, physical strength and school achievement. To enable all children to survive and thrive post-SAM, it is vital to focus more on those with disabilities. SAM treatment programmes should consider using not just clinical assessment but structured assessments to better identify at-risk individuals as well as understand the population of children for which they are developing services.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Haiti and the health marketplace: the role of the private, informal market in filling the gaps left by the state

Abstract: Background: In most societies the health marketplace is pluralistic in character, with a mix of formal and informal providers. In high-income countries, state regulation of the market helps ensure quality and access and mitigate market failures. In the present study, using Haiti as a case study, we explore what happens to the functioning of the pluralistic health marketplace in severely disrupted environments where the informal sector is able to flourish. Methods: The overall research design was qualitative. Research methods included an extensive documentary and policy analysis, based on peer-reviewed articles, books and "grey" literature-government policy and program reports, unpublished research and evaluations, reviews and reviews from key multilateral and bilateral donors, and non-government organisations, combined with field site visits and in-depth key informant interviews (N = 45). Results: The findings show that state fragility has resulted in a privatised, commoditised and largely unregulated and informal health market. While different market segments can be identified, in reality the boundaries between international/domestic, public/private, for profit/not-for-profit, legal/illegal are hazy and shifting. Discussion: The lack of state capacity to provide an enabling environment, establish, and enforce its regulatory framework has resulted in a highly segmented, heterogeneous and informal health market. The result is deplorable health indices which are far below regional averages and many other low-income countries. Conclusions: Working in fragile states with limited capacity to undertake the core function of securing the health of its population requires new and innovative ways of working. This needs longer time-frames, combining incremental top-down and bottom-up strategies which recognize and work with state and civil society, public and private actors, formal and informal institutions, and progressively facilitate changes in the different market functions of supply, demand, regulation and supporting functions.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Evaluation of Shallow Groundwater Quality at Regional Scales Using Adaptive Water Quality Indices

Abstract: Groundwater, which is the main source of water for human consumption in many rural areas, has its quality determined by the complex interaction of environmental factors and anthropogenic activities. The present study evaluated the quality of shallow groundwater (1 to 25 m depth) in the rural area of the Targoviste Plain, a densely populated area (200 inhabitants/km(2)) using 80 water samples collected from public wells. In order to explain the spatial distribution of the concentrations of the 19 physicochemical parameters considered (including heavy metals), the evaluation of groundwater quality for human consumption and potential impact on human health was conducted using the Water Quality Index (WQI), Integrated Weight Water Quality Index (IwWQI), Total Hazard Index (THI), and cumulative carcinogenic risk (CCR). For the WQI/IwWQI the comparative analysis of the two indices showed that for the WQI, it is important to select an optimal set of parameters, because use of a large number of physicochemical parameters can eclipse the values that exceed WHO guideline limits. In contrast, the use of entropy in the calculation of the IwWQI did not lead to eclipsing of exceedance, no matter the number of parameters used. Areas with poor and very poor groundwater quality according to the WQI/IwWQI overlapped, with a moderate risk to human health (THI > 1) for noncarcinogenic contaminants and also a risk of developing cancer according to the CCR average value (1.15 x 10(-2)). The health of 43% of the rural population in the Targoviste Plain can be affected if they drink contaminated groundwater, and it is estimated that about 600 people can develop cancer during their lifetime. If the risk of developing cancer is reduced only in the rural population that does not have access to a water source from a centralized and verified network, the results suggest that 385 people (1.15%) can develop cancer as a result of consuming groundwater contaminated with heavy metals based on the average value of CCR. This value is lower than the general mortality rate in areas with high CCR and below the average number of cancer patients in Romania (2.65%). The quality of groundwater and the risk of developing diseases and cancer due to water consumption is directly proportional to the intensity of agricultural land use and inversely proportional to the depth of the groundwater layer, the distance from the main hydrographic network and the reservoirs, and the distance from the main city, Targoviste. The complex and integrated analysis of groundwater quality using quality indices and indicators of health risk for the population, validated by hot-spot analysis and compared to the mortality rate, is an approach with practical applicability. This integrated approach allows public authorities, policymakers, and health services to implement an efficient monitoring program and optimize anthropogenic activities in order to prevent groundwater contamination and finally improve the quality of life for the residents in the area of this study.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Between democracy and governance

Abstract: The work of Gerry Stoker and Colin Hay considers the alliance between neoliberalism and public choice theory to be the motor of anti-politics and depoliticization in contemporary Western societies. Their effects have been to hollow out strong statecraft and hard state capacity, as well as the thick collective capacities for representation, participation and deliberation crucial to keeping democratic government responsive, effective and accountable to the common will. On this view, all new forms of connective action are ipso facto rejected as the spawn of neoliberalism: They appear as individualistic and preventing the much needed repoliticizations that can bring the old, strong combination of hard state power and thickly integrated citizenship back in. I do not think this type of politicization strategy will work. There are good reasons why it has fizzled out over time. New forms of political participation and social movements indicate a need for reconnecting political authorities and laypeople on the output side as a form of alternative political problematization strategy. Hay and Stoker want to mobilize citizens for repoliticizing latent or hidden interest and identity conflicts on the input side. By contrast, these new actors insist that it is more important to problematize how policy risks and problems are handled by a network of globally interconnected policy elites from the public, private and even voluntary domains. The challenge for democratic political analysis today is to avoid placing politicization before problematization or vice versa. This requires a new model which does not identify politics with inputs and thereby relegates outputs to the domain of technical, non-political administration and management. Connective action, I argue, manifests a new model for problematizing how policies are authoritatively articulated, performed, delivered and evaluated for the populations. In dismissing it a priori as individualistic and depoliticizing, Hay and Stoker ignore how the new participants and movements provide a new way of problematizing and combating neoliberalism in theory as well as in practice.

Abstract: This article examines the effect of local political settlements on education policies in a decentralised political system. Under what conditions does decentralisation promote learning-enhancing policies? Despite the numerous works on decentralisation and education, little is known about how local politics influences student learning. We develop a novel approach to the politics of education policies by looking at the effect of local political settlements on education policymaking. Using a heuristic case study method comparing three districts in Indonesia, we found that constraints on the discretionary power of the district head over employment decisions in the bureaucracy matter for the development of learning-enhancing policies. Such a constraint can pave the way for the development of the bureaucratic capacity required for local governments to pursue quality-promoting reforms. In the absence of such a constraint, the extent to which district governments will implement learning-enhancing policies depends on district heads' commitment to learning.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Corporate power in the forests of the Solomon Islands

Abstract: IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 1990s, Malaysian investors, backed by Japanese and Korean buyers, pushed log production in the Solomon Islands to more than three times higher than the estimated sustainable level. Japanese log purchases alone in 1995 and 1996 were greater than the sustainable yield in the Solomon Islands. If log production had continued to escalate at the mid-1990s rate, these aggressive investors and traders would have depleted the Solomon Islands of commercial trees in less than a decade. The crash in demand for tropical logs following the 1997-98 economic downturn in Asia has slowed this looming environmental catastrophe. Although this could well be a temporary respite, this does provide the government of Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, which took power in August 1997, an opportunity to reform timber management. This paper examines the most important issue and the greatest obstacle facing reformers: the environmental and economic impact of multinational companies on natural forest management.(1) Cheap forest resources that externalize environmental and social costs lure investors and traders, even into areas with little infrastructure. Once there, these corporations generally harvest logs as quickly and cheaply as possible. Logically, they do not function within the bounds of formal laws or policies but rather within the bounds of state and societal rules that are actually enforced, persistently trying to bend these rules in their favour. They strain state capacity to manage forest resources, pressure and entice state officials to develop policies that maximize corporate profits, construct complex corporate structures that reduce accountability and transparency, and evade taxes and timber royalties. Corporations also generate financial incentives that stimulate unsustainable production, harvest concessions illegally and destructively, break or distort obligations to communities and landowners, make informal deals that lower export prices, and construct trade chains that depress consumer prices and stimulate wasteful consumption. These practices seem to suggest that corporations in the Solomon Islands are mischievous or devious resource exploiters. In some ways they are. But often they are rationally responding to market signals, the viability, profitability and uncertainty of operations, and the extent of state and societal controls. The paper begins with a brief discussion of the theoretical literature on the environmental impact on natural resources of multinational corporations. The second section provides essential background on commercial forest resources, environmental policies and forest institutions in the Solomon Islands. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth sections examine the actual impact of these policies and institutions on the behaviour of multinational investors. The seventh section analyzes the effect of corporate buyers. The conclusion reflects on the importance of the findings in the Solomon Islands for understanding the effects of timber corporations on environmental management in tropical regions.

Abstract: This paper shows that an economic slump can induce a government to invest in fiscal capacity. Large negative income shocks stress the revenue-raising capability of narrow tax bases, making an increase in tax base breadth desirable relative to its fixed implementation cost. A broader tax base enables revenue to be raised at lower tax rates, and so lower deadweight loss. The behavior of US state governments during the Great Depression supports the model: states experiencing larger than average negative income shocks were more likely to adopt a retail sales tax than were states experiencing smaller than average income shocks.

Abstract: Multinational firms often shift their incomes to low-tax jurisdictions, thus robbing host states of tax revenue. I offer a new theory to explain why some firms do this while others do not. I argue that firms that are more vulnerable to government expropriation are, counterintuitively, less likely to shift income offshore, since complying fully with tax law gives the government a greater stake in their survival. Analyzing a registry-based panel data on multinational firms, their tax burdens, and a cross-sectional information of the firms' connections to tax havens, l find that, other things equal, firms with more concentrated fixed assets are less likely to use havens. These results challenge existing theories of the political economy of development. Whereas the "Pillars of Prosperity"theory suggests that successful states simultaneously develop protection of property rights and fiscal capacity, my results show that perfect property rights protection can actually undermine the state's ability to tax.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to gauge the various determinants of social sector spending captured by social protection and education spending in a cross section of developing countries, a subject on which there is scant empirical evidence. We hypothesize that fiscal capacity is necessary but not sufficient for resource allocation in this area, because the political will to do so must also be present. Using a panel data instrumental variable approach, we find that greater fiscal capacity robustly raises social spending in developing countries in the period 1990 to 2010. It is also strongly evident that rising democratisation enhances social sector spending; the presence of greater democracy and higher fiscal capacity could reinforce this effect. Our work also innovatively incorporates inequality into the analysis, finding that social expenditure is greater in more egalitarian societies. Military expenditure also appears to crowd out social protection expenditure, but not robustly.

Abstract: Motivated by agency theory, we investigate the effect of board independence on dividend policy. We exploit as a quasi-natural experiment the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the associ-ated exchange listing requirement, mandating firms to have a majority of independent directors. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that firms forced to raise board independence are significantly more likely to pay dividends than firms not required to change board independence. Our results are consistent with the notion that stronger board independence forces managers to disgorge more cash to shareholders, thereby reducing what is left for possible expropriation by opportunistic managers. Based on an exogenous regulatory shock, our results are more likely to show a casual effect, rather than merely an association.

The timing of the conflict was plausibly exogenous: the fall of al-Gaddafi's regime in Libya in 2011 triggered the return of the Tuareg fighters from the demised leader's Praetorian guard to their homeland in Northern Mali. Using representative survey data on the salience of national and ethnic identities, we perform a difference-in-differences estimation and find that the out-break of the conflict prompted Malian residents living closer to the conflict zone to decrease their national identity more than the residents further away. We argue that this effect is likely to have been driven by proximity to violent events perpetrated by separatist groups and not by selective migration, exposure to internally displaced persons, communal violence, or other potential alternative explanations. Our results are consistent with the qualitative evidence on the matter. We place these findings in the con-text of recent theoretical advances in identity economics.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract: Civil wars reflect, in part, internal contestation over the provision of resources. A government's ability to buy off rebellion by providing social welfare payments is one mechanism to help ensure social stability. In times of economic distress, however, the government becomes increasingly constrained in its ability to provide social welfare and, absent some form of financial relief, will be subject to increasing pressure from potential rebel groups. Migrant remittances can serve as a smoothing mechanism that provides for social welfare needs outside the formal mechanisms of the state, and therefore acts to reduce the incentive for rebellion. We develop a model of migrant remittances as a vehicle that provides domestic stability in times of economic constraints. We test hypotheses from this model on World Bank remittance data to 152 countries from 1980 to 2005. Our results suggest that a significant increase in migrant remittances during crises can lower the risk of civil war.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: COVID-19 fatalities and internal conflict: Does government economic support matter?

Abstract: This study examines the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict and investigates the possible moderating role of government economic support during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. Our main hypothesis suggests that countries with lower levels of gov-ernment economic support are more likely to experience a positive correlation between higher COVID-19 mortality rates and the emergence of internal conflict. Using cross-country data from over 100 countries and controlling for various factors that may influence internal conflict, our analysis provides some support for this hypothesis. The results suggest a possible moderating role for government economic support, with the evidence indicating a weakening or elimination of the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict when government economic support is adequate. However, the moderating effect of government economic support is not always significant, and caution is needed when interpreting the results. Our analysis also high-lights the potential risks associated with low levels of government economic support during the pandemic. Specifically, we find that in countries where the government's macro-financial pack-age in response to the pandemic is less than approximately 25% of GDP, there is a possible risk of growth in civil disorder resulting from increased COVID-19 deaths per million.

Abstract: This study presents a machine-learning-enhanced method of modeling PM2.5 personal exposures in a data-scarce, rural, solid fuel use context. Data collected during a cookstove (Africa Clean Energy (ACE)-1 solar-battery-powered stove) intervention program in rural Lao PDR are presented and leveraged to explore advanced techniques for predicting personal exposures to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). Mean 48-h PM2.5 exposure concentrations for female cooks were measured for the pre- and post-intervention periods (the "Before" and "After" periods, respectively) as 123 mu g/m(3) and 81 mu g/m(3). Mean 48-h PM(2.5 )kitchen air pollution ("KAP") concentrations were measured at 462 mu g/m(3) Before and 124 mu g/m(3) After. Application of machine learning and ensemble modeling demonstrated cross-validated personal exposure predictions that were modest at the individual level but reasonably strong at the group level, with the best models producing an observed vs. predicted r(2) between 0.26 and 0.31 (r(2) = 0.49 when using a smaller, un-imputed dataset) and mean Before estimates of 119-120 pg/m(3) and After estimates of 86-88 mu g/m(3). This offered improvement over one typical method of predicting exposure - using a kitchen exposure factor (the ratio of exposure to KAP)-which demonstrated an r(2) similar to 0.03 and poorly estimated group average values. The results of these analyses highlight areas of methodological improvement for future exposure assessments of household air pollution and provide evidence for researchers to explore the advantages of further incorporating machine learning methods into similar research across wider geographic and cultural contexts.

Abstract: Background Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning is a largely preventable cause of death that has received insufficient attention. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive global analysis of the demographic, temporal, and geographical patterns of fatal unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from 2000 to 2021. Methods As part of the latest Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning mortality was quantified using the GBD cause of death ensemble modelling strategy. Vital registration data and covariates with an epidemiological link to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning informed the estimates of death counts and mortality rates for all locations, sexes, ages, and years included in the GBD. Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying deaths by remaining standard life expectancy at age of death. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning deaths due to occupational injuries and high alcohol use were estimated. Findings In 2021, the global mortality rate due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning was 0 center dot 366 per 100 000 (95% uncertainty interval 0 center dot 276-0 center dot 415), with 28 900 deaths (21 700-32 800) and 1 center dot 18 million YLLs (0 center dot 886-1 center dot 35) across all ages. Nearly 70% of deaths occurred in males (20 100 [15 800-24 000]), and the 50-54-year age group had the largest number of deaths (2210 [1660-2590]). The highest mortality rate was in those aged 85 years or older with 1 center dot 96 deaths (1 center dot 38-2 center dot 32) per 100 000. Eastern Europe had the highest age-standardised mortality rate at 2 center dot 12 deaths (1 center dot 98-2 center dot 30) per 100 000. Globally, there was a 53 center dot 5% (46 center dot 2-63 center dot 7) decrease in the age-standardised mortality rate from 2000 to 2021, although this decline was not uniform across regions. The overall PAFs for occupational injuries and high alcohol use were 13 center dot 6% (11 center dot 9-16 center dot 0) and 3 center dot 5% (1 center dot 4-6 center dot 2), respectively. Interpretation Improvements in unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning mortality rates have been inconsistent across regions and over time since 2000. Given that unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning is almost entirely preventable, policy-level interventions that lower the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning events should be prioritised, such as those that increase access to improved heating and cooking devices, reduce carbon monoxide emissions from generators, and mandate use of carbon monoxide alarms.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited a wide range of national responses with an even wider range of outcomes in terms of infections and mortalities. Australia is a rare success story, keeping deaths comparatively low, and infections too, until the Omicron wave. What explains Australia’s success? Typical explanations emphasise leaders’ choices. We agree, but argue that leaders’ choices, and whether these are implemented effectively, is shaped by the legacy of state transformation. Decades of neo-liberal reforms have hollowed out state capacity and confused lines of control and accountability, leaving Australia unprepared for the pandemic. Leaders thus abandoned plans and turned to ad hoc, simple to implement emergency measures–border closures and lockdowns. These averted large-scale outbreaks and deaths, but with diminishing returns as the Delta variant took hold. Conversely, Australia’s regulatory state has struggled to deliver more sophisticated policy responses, even when leaders were apparently committed, including an effective quarantine system, crucial for border controls, and vaccination programme, essential for exiting the quagmire of lockdowns and closed borders, leading to a partial return to top-down governing. The Australian experience shows that to avoid a public health catastrophe or more damaging lockdowns in the next pandemic, states must re-learn to govern. © 2022 Journal of Contemporary Asia.

Abstract: Focusing predominantly on media coverage, but drawing also on a small selection of other cultural texts, such as film and television, this chapter explores gendered representations of Australian soldiers in the twenty-first century within the context of contemporary debates about Australia’s military role, misogyny and sexism, and the very nature of Australian national identity. Its examination of representations of Australian military personnel and changes to operations since 2001 reveals disconnection between public memory, public image, and an institutional identity that is at odds with the institutional capacity of the Australian Defence Force to enact positive change in relation to social concerns, such as gender equality. It concludes that greater diversity in cultural representations will better support the reality of working in the ADF and the experiences of Australian soldiers in conflict and at peace. © 2017, The Author(s).

Abstract: We examine the effect of stock liquidity and corporate governance on the firm's leverage decision in the order-driven stock trading system and less stringent governance environment of Australia. Using a sample of 1207 non-financial firms from 2001 to 2013, resulting in 9855 firm-year observations, we find the posited negative stock liquidity–leverage relation, confirming prior research observations that firms with more liquid stocks are significantly less leveraged. We also find a significant and negative relation between corporate governance quality (CGQ) and leverage, indicating that firms with high CGQ significantly reduce leverage. In a closer analysis, we find that the significantly negative CGQ–leverage relation exists only for firms with high stock liquidity and does not exist for firms with low stock liquidity. Our study is the first to examine such an interactive relationship among stock liquidity, corporate governance and leverage. The results, which are robust to a range of alternative proxies and to additional tests, provide new insights into the determinants of leverage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Managing large river basins for sustainability is a contentious social–ecological arena challenging traditional scientific and rational planning approaches to water and related natural resources governance. “Crises” are inevitable but double-edged: creating threats and uncertainties, but also new opportunities to shape trajectories of change and avoid adverse consequences. A case study of the large remote cross-border Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), in arid central Australia, shows how over two decades a series of social–ecological and political–administrative “crises” emerged, posing significant environmental and social dilemmas for water governance, while also opening up opportunities for institutional change. This article examines the role of crises in the emergence and evolution of water governance in the LEB, how they were perceived, the challenges and opportunities posed, social and institutional responses, and governance capacity outcomes. Finally, it reflects on emergent crises as opportunities for more systemic and adaptive change in large river basins. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract: Asia–Pacific countries are experiencing rapid economic growth. Is this growth ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors-based and aligned growth? Therefore, this study investigates the connections between ESG indicators and economic growth in East Asia Pacific and South Asia. To achieve this aim, we employed the FMOLS, DOLS, and AMG models. While the AMG model highlights significant long-term positive effects of the environmental (EFs) and governance factors (GOVNF) on economic growth, the FMOLS and DOLS models emphasize the substantial influence of social factors (SOC) on economic growth. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of ESG factors and offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align strategies with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Notably, the GOVNF, with components like control of corruption, regulatory quality, rule of law, and government effectiveness, does not influence the GDP of developed nations, such as Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. However, its significance is evident in countries like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. This result might stem from the possibility that developed countries have historically addressed and resolved issues like corruption and the rule of law, while these elements remain crucial determinants for the economic growth of developing nations like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Empirical findings provide the region's policymakers with essential insights and a guide for implementing their economic growth policies ESG factor-based and aligned to the United Nations' SDGs.

Abstract: Coral reef restoration is gaining considerable momentum globally in response to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs. In Australia, as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP), a range of unconventional interventions are currently being investigated to help the Great Barrier Reef resist, repair and recover from climate change. Many of these interventions are based on innovative approaches, such as assisted evolution. The regulatory environment is likely to be critical in determining the feasibility and viability of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It influences what, where and how to restore, who should be responsible for, engaged in, and benefit from restoration. This study explores the regulatory implications of proposed restoration and adaptation interventions in the context of the Great Barrier Reef. This includes mapping the existing regulatory and governance landscape, establishing an approach to account for regulatory requirements of restoration and adaptation interventions, and examining regulatory issues associated with their development and deployment. The study also scopes administrative capacity; i.e., the capacity of regulators in terms of resources and skills required to assess novel risks and impacts of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It provides important insights that may prove useful for other jurisdictions, where ecosystem restoration and adaptation has become an imperative under a fast-changing climate. © 2019

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Mental Health Public Policy in Global Context: A Comparative Study of Policy Transfer in Samoa and Tonga

Abstract: This book explores the development of mental health systems in the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) of Samoa and Tonga through an examination of several policy transfer events from the colonial to the contemporary. Beginning in the 1990s, mental health became an area of global policy concern as reflected in concerted international organisation and bilateral aid and development agendas, most notably those of the World Bank, World Health Organization, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand. This book highlights how Tonga and Samoa both reformed their respective mental health systems during these years, after relatively long periods of stagnation. Using recent scholarship concerning public policy transfer, this book explains these policy outcomes and expands it to include consideration of the historical institutional dimensions evidenced by contemporary mental health systems. This book considers three distinct levels of policy implicated in mental health system transfer processes from developed to developing nations: colonial authority and influence; decolonisation processes; and the global development agenda surrounding health systems. In the process, the author argues that there are in fact three levels of policy change that must be accounted for in examining contemporary policy change. These policy levels include formal policy transfers, which tend to be prescriptive, involving professional problem construction and the designation of appropriate state apparatus for curative or custodial care provision; quasi-formal transfers, which tend to be aspirational and involve policy instruments developed through collaborative, participatory processes; and informal transfers that tend to be normative and include practices by professional actors in delivering service merged with traditional cultural beliefs as to disease aetiology as well as reflecting a deep understanding of the cultural context within which the services will be delivered. This book argues that a renewed focus on the importance of public policy and government institutional capacity is necessary to ensure human rights and justice are secured. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

Abstract: We develop a state capacity framework to account for different national responses to Covid-19. Our starting point is the influential idea that neoliberalism has a major role to play in state failure to control the pandemic. By implementing neoliberal reforms, states have ostensibly rendered themselves incapable of preventing or mitigating the viral outbreak. A focus on the British experience lends weight to this perspective. But when viewed in a comparative light, the picture is less straightforward. By comparing the British and Australian cases, we see a similar embrace of neoliberal reforms across the whole of government, yet with strikingly divergent outcomes. How can we account for this dramatic difference? To answer this question, we offer an enhanced state capacity framework to improve our understanding of diverse national responses to Covid-19. Our larger objective is to enrich the existing state capacity literature in two ways. First, we extend the existing state capacity framework by introducing a new category–salutary capacity–to encapsulate a state's ability to correct and counteract the course of a national health emergency. Second, we introduce the idea of political choice to emphasise the importance of agency in offsetting the institutional weaknesses associated with neoliberal reform. © 2021 The Author(s).

Abstract: Classical organizational management literature draws clear parallels between organizational culture and climate and effective use of power and influence as key to successful policy implementation of reforms in public sector organizations. On the other hand, the public policy literature, in particular, policy transfer as a strand within policy studies, emphasizes the role of the national context, more specifically, ‘facilitators’ and ‘constraints’ of ‘‘politico-administrative culture” within the national context, as crucial to understanding processes of transfer, convergence, and diffusion of public policy. There is a plethora of studies by Western scholars of public management who have successfully utilized these theoretical underpinnings to study the effectiveness of public service reforms in mature policy environments such as the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand, and others. However, the public policy and comparative public management literature only offers a limited number of case studies from developing, middle-/upper-middle countries, which rely on concepts of organizational management in addition to narratives on the impact of policy learning from global doctrines, such as Weberianism, New Public Management (NPM), and New Public Governance (NPG), and national politics, on the implementation of administrative reforms in those contexts. Kazakhstan, as a resource-affluent post-Soviet country and a bastion of modernization and ‘open government’ in Central Asia or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the post-Soviet era is a case in point. Based on ethnographic research consisting of interviews with elite academics, civil servants, and think-tank activists, as well as reviews of OECD and government strategy reports in Astana, the findings point to a potential abatement of the impact of context constraints such as large power distance and collectivist behavior by context facilitators such as those surrounding the use of ‘trilingualism’ and public diplomacy towards reforms in Kazakhstan particularly in recent years. © 2024 by the author.

Abstract: Water plays an important role in underpinning equitable, stable and productive societies and ecosystems. Hence, United Nations recognized ensuring water security as one (Goal 6) of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs). Many international river basins are likely to experience 'low water security' over the coming decades. Water security is rooted not only in the physical availability of freshwater resources relative to water demand, but also on social and economic factors (e.g. sound water planning and management approaches, institutional capacity to provide water services, sustainable economic policies). Until recently, advanced tools and methods are available for the assessment of water scarcity. However, quantitative and integrated - physical and socio-economic - approaches for spatial analysis of water security at global level are not available yet. In this study, we present a spatial multi-criteria analysis framework to provide a global assessment of water security. The selected indicators are based on Goal 6 of SDGs. The term 'security' is conceptualized as a function of 'availability', 'accessibility to services', 'safety and quality', and 'management'. The proposed global water security index (GWSI) is calculated by aggregating indicator values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using the ordered weighted average method, which allows for the exploration of the sensitivity of final maps to different attitudes of hypothetical policy makers. Our assessment suggests that countries of Africa, South Asia and Middle East experience very low water security. Other areas of high water scarcity, such as some parts of United States, Australia and Southern Europe, show better GWSI values, due to good performance of management, safety and quality, and accessibility. The GWSI maps show the areas of the world in which integrated strategies are needed to achieve water related targets of the SDGs particularly in the African and Asian continents. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Abstract: Food systems and the communities they support are increasingly challenged by climate change and the need to arrest escalating threats through mitigation and adaptation. To ensure climate change mitigation strategies can be implemented effectively and to support substantial gains in greenhouse gas emissions reduction, it is, therefore, valuable to understand where climatesmart strategies might be used for best effect. We assessed mariculture in 171 coastal countries for vulnerabilities to climate change (12 indicators) and opportunities to deliver climate mitigation outcomes (nine indicators). We identified Northern America and Europe as having comparatively lower regional vulnerability and higher opportunity for impact on climate mitigation. Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway and the United States of America were identified as wellpositioned to advance strategies linked to mariculture. However, the nature of vulnerabilities and opportunities within and between all regions and countries varied, due to the formation of existing mariculture, human development factors and governance capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that global discussion will be valuable to motivating climate-smart approaches associated with mariculture, but to ensure these solutions contribute to a resilient future, for industry, ecosystems and communities, local adaptation will be needed to address constraints and to leverage local prospects.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Behavioural change and cultural evolution, rather than cultural change: Insights for Australian Public Service Reform

Abstract: Cultural change is often positioned as central to transformation within the Australian Public Service (APS). The ongoing focus on cultural change suggests it has not yet been realised, which is unsurprising, given it is so difficult to change. However, cultural change may also be impeded due to the way it is portrayed within the APS. This article draws on the work of Schein to identify three problems with how organisational culture and cultural change are portrayed in the APS, including the focus on a unified APS culture, the simplistic way in which culture is portrayed, and the general and high-level claims for how to achieve cultural change. It provides three recommendations for how these problems can be addressed, including focusing on high-level principles for conduct across the APS (rather than a unified APS culture), focusing on cultural evolution at the department, agency, and subunit levels, and supporting cultural evolution through establishing mechanisms for behavioural change. Adopting this approach could enable the APS to realise desired changes and enable success of the Albanese Government's APS reform agenda. Points for practitioners: Cultural change is difficult to achieve due to culture being deeply embedded, underpinned by a stable system of values, beliefs, and assumptions. Change could be realised within the APS through focusing on cultural evolution, rather than cultural change—specifically at the department, agency, and subunit levels where there is some compatibility between existing and desired cultures. Cultural evolution requires the identification of the specific behaviours required for effective change, followed by a reconfiguration of a range of mechanisms required to embed and reinforce behavioural change. Leaders play a central role in facilitating behavioural change and cultural evolution, but doing this effectively may require leadership cognitive shifts; therefore, leaders need support and development. © 2023 The Authors.

Abstract: Improving the energy efficiency of economies is the core of promoting global sustainable development. At present, improving energy efficiency is a common problem faced by all countries. In this paper, the Three-stage DEA model improved by radial slack based measure (SBM) model is used to evaluate the energy efficiency and influencing factors of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) members. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes of energy efficiency of each country are further explored by the Malmquist index model. The empirical analysis shows that the energy efficiency of China, Japan, and Australia are all 1, which is at the forefront of efficiency, while the energy efficiency of Vietnam is the lowest, which is 0.136. China's technological progress change index is 1.013, leading other countries. The results of the study are helpful to understand the trend of energy efficiency changes in various countries, to transform their energy efficiency advantages into the common advantages of each member state, and to improve the comprehensive governance capacity of energy efficiency of each country. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: Germany's activities in the transnationalization of higher education reveal distinctive patterns of its policy coordination. In contrast to sending countries such as Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, German state actors are involved in the implementation of cross-border projects. In the article, we analyze data in connection to the theoretical debate on the nation state's role in policy coordination. We therefore introduce the policy design to study the coordination practices employed by state actors while mapping changes in the institutional arrangements of German transnational education. As a result, we discuss a new form of policy layering, which we propose to call ‘horizontal layering’. Originating in the observation of competing state actors and their strategies to avoid interdepartmental conflicts, this type of policy design leads to a policy field charged with an increasing number of partially contradictory policy objectives, lowering the state's capacity for efficient policy formulation. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization

Abstract: This article analyses the redistributive efficiency of social transfers and direct taxation in a panel of 28 developed economies during the period 1995–2010. In order to explore how redistribution is achieved through these fiscal policies, a two-stage approach is applied. First, we evaluate their redistributive efficiency – the degree of redistribution attained for a given level of transfers and taxes – using data envelopment analysis (DEA). We find lower redistributive efficiency in Southern Europe and the United States and higher efficiency levels in the Nordic and Central European countries and Australia. Second, we use panel regression analysis to identify the determinants of efficiency differences and reveal the crucial role of government quality as well as factors affecting the redistributive profile of fiscal policies. © The Author(s) 2017.

Abstract: In the wake of new public management, and with the emergence of new public governance, a number of challenges remain unsolved in the field of public service governance and management. In this paper, we use the example of the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme to show how we might deal with the design and implementation of a public service reform within the context of new public governance. We argue that governments need to develop greater openness to risk and policy experimentation during implementation. We therefore propose an adaptive system architecture that could support such risk taking. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Abstract: Background: Indigenous young people worldwide possess unique protective factors that support wellbeing. However, they experience mental illness at higher rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. Digital mental health (dMH) resources can increase access to structured, timely, and culturally tailored mental health interventions by reducing structural and attitudinal barriers to accessing treatment. The involvement of Indigenous young people in dMH resource development is recommended, however, no guidelines exist on how this can best be facilitated. Methods: A scoping review examining processes to involve Indigenous young people in developing or evaluating dMH interventions was conducted. Studies reported between 1990 and 2023 involving Indigenous young people aged 12–24 years, originating from Canada, the USA, New Zealand, and Australia, in the development or evaluation of dMH interventions were eligible for inclusion. Following a three-step search process, four electronic databases were searched. Data were extracted, synthesized, and described under three categories: dMH intervention attributes, study design, and alignment with research best practice. Best practice recommendations for Indigenous research and participatory design principles derived from the literature were identified and synthesised. Included studies were assessed against these recommendations. Consultation with two Senior Indigenous Research Officers ensured Indigenous worldviews informed analysis. Results: Twenty-four studies describing eleven dMH interventions met inclusion criteria. Studies included formative, design, pilot, and efficacy studies. Overall, most included studies demonstrated a high degree of Indigenous governance, capacity building, and community benefit. All studies adapted their research processes to ensure that local community protocols were followed and most aligned these within an Indigenous research paradigm. Formal agreements regarding existing and created intellectual property and implementation evaluations were rare. Outcomes were the primary focus of reporting, with limited detailed descriptions of governance and decision-making processes or strategies for managing predictable tensions between co-design stakeholders. Conclusions: This study identified recommendations for undertaking participatory design with Indigenous young people and evaluated the current literature against these criteria. Common gaps were evident in the reporting of study processes. Consistent, in-depth reporting is needed to allow assessment of approaches for this hard-to-reach population. An emergent framework, informed by our findings, for guiding the involvement of Indigenous young people in the design and evaluation of dMH tools is presented.

Abstract: Background Few studies have explored behavioural and financial impacts of retail initiatives after 2 years to address the unhealthy food environments common in local government sporting settings. Aims To evaluate the impact of a 2-year local government capacity building intervention in sporting facility food outlets on (1) the healthiness of refrigerated drink choices available and visible to customers, (2) healthiness of refrigerated drinks sold and (3) refrigerated drink revenue. Methods 52 sporting facilities within 8 local governments from Victoria, Australia, participated in an intervention between March 2018 and February 2020 by limiting € red' (least healthy) drinks to ≤20% of refrigerator display and increasing € green' (healthiest) drinks to ≥50% of display. Mixed models assessed changes in mean percentage of € red', € amber' and € green' drinks displayed over time, compared with baseline. Facilities provided electronic weekly itemised sales data (December 2015 to February 2020). Weekly volume of € red' or € green' drinks sold as a proportion of total drinks sold, and total refrigerated drinks revenue were compared preimplementation and postimplementation using mixed models (seasonal facilities), and mixed-effect interrupted time series models (non-seasonal facilities). Results Display of € red' drinks decreased by mean -17.1 percentage points (pp) (95% CI -23.9 to -10.3) and € green' drinks increased 16.1 pp (95% CI 9.30, 22.9) between baseline and 18-month audits. At nine seasonal facilities, compared with the summer preimplementation, the mean volume of € red' drinks sold decreased by -19.0 pp (95% CI -28.6, to -9.51) and refrigerated drink revenue decreased by-AU$81.8 (95% CI -AU$123 to -AU$40.8) per week. At 15 non-seasonal facilities, by February 2020, the volume of € red' drinks sold decreased on average by -11.0 pp (95% CI -21.6 to -0.41) with no change in drink revenue. Conclusion Reducing the display of unhealthy drinks can be an effective public health policy to improve the healthiness of customer purchases, provided there is consideration of potential impacts on revenue.  © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

Abstract: Australia's terrestrial environment has been dramatically modified since European colonisation. Deforestation - the clearing and modification of native forest for agricultural, urban and industrial development - remains a significant threat to Australia's biodiversity. Substantial policy reform over the last 40 years has delivered a range of policy instruments aimed to control deforestation across all Australian States and Territories. Despite these policy efforts - as well as strong governance and high institutional capacity - deforestation rates in Australia were nonetheless globally significant at the turn of this century. Legislation introduced in Queensland and New South Wales during the mid-2000s was at the time seen to have effectively ended broad-scale clearing; however, recent policy changes have raised concerns that Australia may again become a global hotspot for deforestation. Here, I describe the deforestation trends, drivers and policy responses in Australia over the last four decades. Using satellite imagery of forest cover and deforestation events across Australia between 1972 and 2014, I present a comprehensive analysis of deforestation rates at a fine resolution. I discuss trends in deforestation with reference to the institutional, macroeconomic and environmental conditions that are associated with human-induced forest loss in Australia. I provide a detailed history and critique of the native vegetation policies introduced across Australia over the last 40 years, including recent legislative amendments and reviews. Finally, I comment on future prospects for curbing deforestation in Australia, including the role of incentive-based policies such as carbon farming, private land conservation and biodiversity offsets. Despite being a highly active policy space, very little is known of the effectiveness of policy responses to deforestation in Australia, and whether the recent shift away from 'command and control' policies will necessarily lead to better outcomes. My analysis demonstrates the need for an effective policy mix to curb deforestation in Australia, including a greater focus on monitoring, evaluation and policy learning. © CSIRO 2016.

Abstract: Despite the billions of dollars invested in improving Indigenous health and wellbeing outcomes in Australia, there is little evidence of program effectiveness to inform policy and practice. The deficiency of evaluations is problematic. Critical to this process is the effective engagement of commissioners with Indigenous peoples, which is not well documented. Currently, there is scant evidence on modes of commissioning practices used. This scoping review will aim to identify the spectrum of commissioning practices used when evaluating Indigenous health and wellbeing programs in Australia, codifying them into a model set. Documents (between 2008 and 2020) will be retrieved from Scopus, Proquest, Informit, Google Scholar and via a web-based search that refers to the commissioning of Indigenous health and wellbeing program evaluations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada or the United States. Importantly, the research team is Indigenous-led and the project’s governance, quality and translation framework will be informed by a project advisory group, including Indigenous associates. This will be the first scoping review globally to identify practices used to commission Indigenous health and wellbeing program evaluations. Results will be utilised to strengthen the commissioning practices of Indigenous health and wellbeing programs in Australia and overseas. © The Author(s) 2023.

Abstract: Background: With their close connection to community and increasing preventive health remit, local governments are well positioned to implement policies and programs to address health inequities. Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence of equity-focused policy action in this sector. We aimed to understand how local government representatives approach equity in the development and implementation of health and wellbeing policies and programs, and to identify potential enablers for strengthening an equity focus. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews (June 2022-January 2023) with 29 health directorate representatives from 21 local governments in Victoria, Australia. Representatives were recruited from urban, regional and rural local government areas, with varying levels of socioeconomic position. Data was analysed inductively using Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis, informed by social determinants of health theory and a public policy decision making framework. Results: Local governments approach health equity in different ways including focusing on priority populations, disadvantaged geographic areas, or by targeting the upstream determinants of health, such as housing and employment. Enabling factors for more equity-oriented local government policy action included those internal to local governments: (i) having a clear conceptualisation of equity, (ii) fostering a strong equity-centric culture, and (iii) developing organisational-wide competency in health equity. External factors related to key stakeholder groups that support and/or influence local governments included: (iv) strong support from community, (v) state government leadership and legislation, and (vi) supportive local partners, networks and NGO’s. Conclusions: Local governments have a responsibility to implement policies and programs that improve health and reduce health inequities. Local government’s capacity to leverage resources, structures, processes and relationships, internally and across sectors and community, will be key to strengthening equity-oriented local government health policies and programs. © 2023, The Author(s).

Abstract: In public service reforms across Australia, the task of adapting to the “digital age” is prioritised over broader societal adaptations to interrelated economic, health, and ecological crises. Within this landscape, design tools travel freely and rapidly through a plurality of entangled service worlds. However, when presented as universal and neutral towards the technologies and worldviews that shape public services, design tools potentially displace alternative approaches to servicing publics. Through two co-designing events with a waste service provider and a service design workshop, we outline the ways we employ a “plurality” of design tools that catalyse Indigenous and western knowledge systems. We consider how practices with design tools that amplify plural worldviews nurtures relational thinking, allowing people to “see” tensions, consequences, and redirections for public service designing. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The role of 'non-knowledge' in crisis policymaking: a proposal and agenda for future research

Abstract: Background: Recent complex and cross-boundary policy problems, such as climate change, pandemics, and financial crises, have recentred debates about state capacity, democratic discontent and the 'crisis of expertise'. These problems are contested and open to redefinition, misunderstanding, spin, and deception, challenging the ability of policymakers to locate, discriminate, comprehend, and respond to competing sources of knowledge and expertise. We argue that 'non-knowledge' is an under-explored aspect of responses to major policy crises. Key points: While discussed in recent work in sociology and other social sciences, non-knowledge has been given less explicit attention in policy studies, and is not fully captured by orthodox understandings of knowledge and evidence use. We outline three main forms of non-knowledge that challenge public agencies: amnesia, ignorance and misinformation. In each case, 'non-knowledge' is not simply the absence of policy-relevant knowledge. Amnesia refers to what is forgotten, reinvented or 'unlearned', while claims of ignorance involve obscuring or casting aside of relevant knowledge that could (or even should) be available. To be misinformed is to actively believe false or misleading information. In each instance, non-knowledge may have strategic value for policy actors or aid the pursuit of self-interest. Conclusions and implications: We demonstrate the relevance of non-knowledge through a brief case study, emerging from the inquiry into the COVID-19 hotel quarantine programme in the Australian state of Victoria. We argue that both amnesia and 'practical' forms of ignorance contributed to failures during the early part of the programme.  © Policy Press 2023.

Abstract: Thailand’s transition to a low-carbon economy faces significant challenges, including a dependency on fossil fuels, fluctuating energy costs, and limited policy clarity. This study conducts a comparative analysis of energy transition policies in Germany, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore to derive actionable lessons that can be adapted to Thailand’s socio-economic and energy contexts. Using the Integrated National Energy Planning (INEP) framework and Network Governance Theory, the research identifies key strategies, such as setting clear and achievable renewable energy targets, establishing robust legal frameworks, fostering multi-stakeholder engagement, and encouraging decentralized governance. The findings highlight the importance of long-term vision, inclusive governance, and targeted investments in renewable technologies to accelerate energy transitions. This paper presents policy guidelines to enhance Thailand’s energy security and contribute to its climate goals by promoting public awareness and strengthening institutional capacities. By adapting these strategies, Thailand can align with global energy trends, reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, and advance toward a resilient and sustainable energy system, aligned with global energy trends while addressing its unique socio-economic context. © 2024 by the author.

Abstract: Why does corruption persist over long periods of time? Why is it so difficult to eliminate? Suggesting that corruption is deeply rooted in the underlying social and historical political structures of a country, Uslaner observes that there is a powerful statistical relationship between levels of mass education in 1870 and corruption levels in 2010 across 78 countries. He argues that an early introduction of universal education is shown to be linked to levels of economic equality and to efforts to increase state capacity. Societies with more equal education gave citizens more opportunities and power for opposing corruption, whilst the need for increased state capacity was a strong motivation for the introduction of universal education in many countries. Evidence for this argument is presented from statistical models, case studies from Northern and Southern Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as a discussions of how some countries escaped the 'trap' of corruption. Presents a novel argument on the relationship between corruption and economic equality, through universal education Uses both statistical analysis and case studies to present evidence on the impact of higher education on corruption Presents historical analysis of how education across the world developed and shaped governance. © Eric M.

Abstract: In October 2012, Australia's parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that a mediation support unit should be created within the Australian Agency for International Development, a department now amalgamated with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The question is: Does Australia possess the motivation and capacity to implement active and effective international mediation by building the capacity of intermediaries to deploy various peacemaking methods to hasten de-escalation at different stages of a conflict? If not, is a mediation support unit an appropriate initiative to address this capability gap? This article draws on quantitative conflict data sets and an expert panel to conclude that Australia's track record demonstrates significant capacity to undertake international mediation, but that the mediation personnel and processes available to government are insufficiently resourced and coordinated to readily provide policymakers with accessible tools to undertake the diverse range of mediation strategies advocated by conflict scholars. While a mediation support unit would address some of these issues, at present it conflicts with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's institutional philosophy based on diffused expertise. © 2016 Australian Institute of International Affairs.

Abstract: Local government in Australia has a strong collective capacity to reduce GHG emissions through policies, funding allocation to renewable energy projects and the delivery of programs and services. This study examines the institutional capacity of councils in Sydney and how this impacts on decisions to invest in alternative energy projects. We find greenhouse gas emission targets of councils are strongly aligned to national targets but do not reflect the local council's institutional capacity, political leadership or strategic priorities. Energy reduction projects are often identified and undertaken by environmental staff without support from financial staff or financial-evaluation tools. An absence of national guidelines to provide consistency in tracking and reporting limits cross-sector benchmarking. Street lighting contributes to a significant proportion of council's total electricity expenditure and GHG emission profile. Being highly regulated, existing contracts and the current practice of street lighting services limits the councils’ ability to reduce emissions. Based on our analysis we recommend a number of measures to overcome these constraints including the use of financial evaluation tools for small-scale renewable energy projects, a standardised national tracking and reporting platform to facilitate progress-reporting and meaningful comparative analysis between councils and policy reform to the regulation of street lighting. © 2016

Abstract: This paper is about the capacity of the federal government in Australia to achieve its stated water management and environmental goals in relation to the Murray-Darling River system via its Murray-Darling Basin Plan of 2012. The paper uses a 'state capacity' approach. One aspect of state capacity is about the state's broad institutional capabilities; these are the ways in which the state's resources and policy instruments,its institutions,and its knowledge and data capabilities can shape the state's capacity to achieve its stated goals. The second aspect is relational,emphasising the notion of 'infrastructural power',or how states might be able to achieve their goals by working cooperatively with major interlocutors in the broader state or in society. These two aspects are typically viewed from a state-centric perspective,with the state depicted as using its broad institutional capacities to help further its relational or infrastructural power over other interlocutors. In contrast,this paper shows how this process has been reversed,and how key interlocutors,including important players in federal and state governments and powerful irrigation interests,have instead drawn resources from and manipulated the key institutional elements of state capacity to suit their own interests,weaken the federal state’s infrastructural power,and subvert the stated aims of the Basin Plan. © This Article Is Distributed Under The Terms Of The Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Sharealike License Which Permits Any Non Commercial Use,Distribution,And Reproduction In Any Medium,Provided The Original Author(S) And Source Are Credited.

Abstract: Given the global crises confronting the world today, it is important to interrogate the notion of “the modern state” and to evaluate its effectiveness in providing security and services for its populations, including the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. This book investigates the modern state’s capacity to serve its constituents by examining the organisations that facilitate two key elements of contemporary living: social capital and social enterprise. These elements are explored in a series of rich case studies located in Australia, Ireland and Bangladesh, with broader implications for policy and practice in the rest of the world. The case studies highlight the growing importance of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship in fostering social capital and in contributing to the idea of “the enabling state”.

Abstract: This study examines whether the effectiveness of board subcommittees is associated with director attrition and the attraction of new directors to boards. Using a sample of firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, we find that nomination and remuneration committee effectiveness is inversely associated with director attrition and positively related to new external directors joining boards. The results suggest the contribution of these subcommittees to improve corporate governance by strengthening the board's human capital through recruitment and retention of suitable talent. Furthermore, the influence of subcommittee effectiveness on attrition (attraction) is more pronounced in firms experiencing higher levels of information asymmetry, weaker governance quality and poorer performance. The results are robust to tests with alternative variables, entropy balanced matching, and additional controls. Overall, our findings show that improved governance through effective subcommittees helps maintain and enhance the human capital of boards. © 2024

Abstract: This study offers new insights into the largest threats to natural and mixed World Heritage sites in developed countries as considered by their management. In addition to this, the capacity of the management to deal with threats is examined. An Ordered Probit model is used that distinguishes three groups of threats and four categories of adaptive capacity of the management. Data originate from the 2014 UNESCO Periodic Report II for sites in economically advanced countries (Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea) linked to the World Heritage Site database. Estimation results reveal that the probability of a major threat to World Heritage sites is perceived to be highest in the category of climate change and extreme weather events, followed by local conditions affecting the physical structure (temperature, rain, dust). Sites in tropical climates are perceived as significantly more threatened, as are those earlier listed as in danger. The likelihood of perceiving a major threat is highest in Turkey, Italy, Norway and North America. Threats related to climate change are those the management has the lowest capacity to deal with when other important aspects are controlled for. Large and natural areas have a higher perceived administrative capacity to deal with threats than others. © 2023, The Author(s).

Abstract: This paper explores the association between director turnover and increased audit fees in Australia. The study, aligned with upper echelon theory, reveals that the characteristics and actions of top management, as reflected in director turnover, impact corporate decisions and risk-taking behavior. Specifically, higher director turnover is linked to elevated audit fees, disrupting the stability of top management's monitoring and advisory functions. The association is more pronounced for external turnover compared to internal turnover. Additionally, firms with robust corporate governance quality exhibit a weakened positive relationship between director turnover and audit fees. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic further amplifies the director turnover/audit fees connection. The findings suggest that auditors are likely to consider and price in the impact of board instability on internal controls and monitoring/advisory functions. © 2023

Abstract: Background: The use of government health data for secondary purposes, such as monitoring the quality of hospital services, researching the health needs of populations, and testing how well new treatments work, is increasing. This increase in the secondary uses of health data has led to increased interest in what the public thinks about data sharing, in particular, the possibilities of sharing with the private sector for research and development. Although international evidence demonstrates broad public support for the secondary use of health data, this support does not extend to sharing health data with the private sector. If governments intend to share health data with the private sector, knowing what the public thinks will be important. This paper reports a national survey to explore public attitudes in Australia toward sharing health data with private companies for research on and development of therapeutic drugs and medical devices. Objective: This study aims to explore public attitudes in Australia toward sharing government health data with the private sector. Methods: A web-based survey tool was developed to assess attitudes about sharing government health data with the private sector. A market research company was employed to administer the web-based survey in June 2019. Results: The survey was completed by 2537 individuals residing in Australia. Between 51.8% and 57.98% of all participants were willing to share their data, with slightly fewer in favor of sharing to improve health services (51.99%) and a slightly higher proportion in favor of sharing for research and development (57.98%). There was a preference for opt-in consent (53.44%) and broad support for placing conditions on sharing health information with private companies (62% to 91.99%). Wide variability was also observed in participants’ views about the extent to which the private sector could be trusted and how well they would behave if entrusted with people’s health information. In their qualitative responses, the participants noted concerns about private sector corporate interests, corruption, and profit making and expressed doubt about the Australian government’s capacity to manage data sharing safely. The percentages presented are adjusted against the Australian population. Conclusions: This nationally representative survey provides preliminary evidence that Australians are uncertain about sharing their health data with the private sector. Although just over half of all the respondents supported sharing health data with the private sector, there was also strong support for strict conditions on sharing data and for opt-in consent and significant concerns about how well the private sector would manage government health data. Addressing public concern about sharing government health data with the private sector will require more and better engagement to build community understanding about how agencies can collect, share, protect, and use their personal data. ©Annette Braunack-Mayer, Belinda Fabrianesi, Jackie Street, Pauline O'Shaughnessy, Stacy M Carter, Lina Engelen, Lucy Carolan, Rebecca Bosward, David Roder, Kylie Sproston.

Abstract: Indigenous peoples within the Murray–Darling Basin have traditionally struggled for the recognition of their cultural, social, environmental, spiritual, commercial and economic connection to the waters that they have traditionally used, as well as their right to engage in all stages of water planning processes. Despite Australian national and federal frameworks providing for the inclusion of Indigenous Australians’ objectives in planning frameworks, water plans have rarely addressed these objectives in water, or the strategies to achieve them. Indeed, insufficient resources, a lack of institutional capacity in both Indigenous communities and agencies and an inadequate understanding of Indigenous people's objectives in water management have limited the extent to which Indigenous objectives are addressed in water plans within the Murray–Darling Basin. In this context, the adoption of specific guidelines to meet Indigenous requirements in relation to basin water resources is crucial to support Indigenous engagement in water planning processes. Using insights from participatory planning methods and human rights frameworks, this article outlines a set of alternative and collaborative guidelines to improve Indigenous involvement in water planning and to promote sustainable and just water allocations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: The concept of ‘justiciability’ in Australian federal jurisprudence has been described by the High Court as a ‘slippery term of indeterminate reference’. With the High Court yet to comprehensively consider the concept of justiciability, Australia’s jurisprudence has failed to develop a coherent doctrine which is apt to govern the outer limits of judicial power under Chapter III of the Constitution. This article argues the transplantation of UK justiciability jurisprudence into Australia’s constitutional context, as well as doctrinal inconsistencies in UK case law, have resulted in applications of the doctrine which undermine key principles of federal judicial power. Drawing on existing case law, this article proposes a reconceptualisation of justiciability into three categories — constitutional competence, institutional capacity and institutional legitimacy — as a principled framework to be applied and developed by Australian jurists going forward. © The Author(s) 2022.

Abstract: Rationale/Purpose: The purpose of the study was to explore how new public management (NPM) components influence the planning and decision-making of local government aquatic and recreation centre (ARCs) development. Methodology: Two case studies were conducted in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Data collection comprised documents (n = 264) and semi-structured interviews (n = 19) to understand the real-life experiences of people involved in ARC planning and decision-making. Deductive analysis was used to identify how NPM components influenced the ARC planning and decision-making process. Findings: ARC planners were primarily driven by financial outputs. Results identified four of the seven NPM components are active in the planning and decision-making across both cases. These include management skills, output controls, creating competition and resource efficiency. Practical implications: From a theoretical perspective, the findings suggest that resource efficiency decisions were prioritised in the ARC decision-making process. Local governments need to consider their motivations towards achieving financial efficiencies and the subsequent impacts on ARC provision. This approach influences local governments’ capacity to address social planning objectives. Research contribution: Local governments in Melbourne, Australia employ NPM principles in their ARC planning and decision-making practices. © 2023 The Author(s).

Abstract: Cyber-enabled foreign interference remains a key threat to many advanced industrial countries. In many cases, the security response has been to build “resilience”–cyber, national and, increasingly, democratic resilience–in line with whole-of-government and whole-of-society strategies. However, many of these securitised responses are “top-down” and elite driven. These resilience agendas do not pay sufficient attention to the views, concerns and threat-perceptions of citizens, potentially undermining their efficacy. In this article, we focus on the Australian case to better understand how citizen cyber skills, threat awareness, and perceptions of institutional capacity can inform democratic resilience to evolving cyber and information risks. We find strong evidence of a clear gap between citizen views and the securitised responses of governments in dealing with cyber-enabled foreign interference. A further issue from the Australian case is that citizens are framed as a passive strategic resource, rather than conceived of as a potentially substantive partner in a “joined-up” response. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Abstract: The study examines the effect of compliance with national governance frameworks on the relationship between corporate governance and the performance of publicly traded companies in Ghana. A sample of 31 companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange was drawn for the study based on their annual reports spanning from 2013 to 2022. A new national governance quality index composed of items drawn from world governance indicators and a corporate governance index was developed by principal component analysis. The study used the Huber M-estimation Robust Least Squares (HMRLS) regression method. The findings of our study reveal that corporate governance practices adversely affect the level of firm performance. However, our results demonstrate that compliance with national governance and institutional frameworks plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. The study offers managerial implications, as listed firms can adopt effective national governance and institutional quality practices to improve firm performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

Abstract: This chapter examines the use of offensive cyber operations by three Western powers (US, UK, Australia) against organized criminals and non-state armed groups. Through the case studies of counter-ISIS operations in 2016-17 and more recent initiatives against ransomware actors, it demonstrates the aims and methods used by state agencies to degrade non-state capacities through cyber means. As these are some of the main case studies of offensive cyber operations in practice available to researchers, they occupy an important, if relatively under-explored, position in the academic and policy landscapes. The chapter outlines the main characteristics of these operations and their roles in expressing and shaping national and collective approaches to offensive cyber operations. It concludes with a consideration of some of the challenges that emerge from the use of offensive cyber capabilities against non-state actors, including measurement of effects and efficacy, their legal and ethical status, and their role as tools of statecraft. © Editors and Contributors Severally 2024.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of corporate governance on the financial choices of non-financial companies operating in the Australian Securities Exchange. A purposive sampling technique was employed to select a total of 113 firms representing 14 sectors listed in the Australian Securities Exchange during the period from 2008 to 2021. The findings of the study revealed a positive and significant relationship between the size of the board, gender diversity among board members, board member affiliation, and board compensation with the financial decisions of the corporations. Additionally, the study identified that the presence of experienced and non-executive board members had a negative and significant impact on internally generated funding. Furthermore, it was observed that board gender diversity, board size, board member affiliation, and board compensation displayed a positive and significant association with debt financing, internally generated financing, and equity financing. Most organisations displayed a preference for internal and debt financing over equity funding. Aligning governance with financial decisions enhances firms’ cost of capital. Governance quality affects capital market access, debt, and equity costs. Effective governance leads to favorable financing terms. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.

Abstract: This case study describes the development and implementation of a governance structure that prioritised First Nations peoples in a local public health Incident Command System activated for the COVID-19 pandemic response in New South Wales, Australia. Using lessons learnt from past pandemics and planning exercises, public health leaders embedded an approach whereby First Nations peoples determined and led community and culturally informed pandemic control strategies and actions. In March 2020, First Nations governance was embedded into the local public health emergency response to COVID-19 in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia, enabling First Nations staff and community members to actively participate in strategic and operational decision-making with the objective of minimising COVID-19-related risks to First Nations peoples and communities. The model provided cultural insight and oversight to the local COVID-19 response; strengthened and advanced First Nations leadership; increased the First Nations public health workforce; led the development of First Nations disease surveillance strategies; and supported working groups to appropriately respond to local needs and priorities. This model demonstrates the feasibility of reframing a standard Incident Command System to embed and value First Nations principles of self-determination and empowerment to appropriately plan and respond to public health emergencies.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Abstract: Global and national strategy emphasises land use planning as a key mechanism for disaster risk reduction (DRR). The practice of planning for natural hazards is devolved to local levels, making the capacity of local government critical for achieving strategic DRR goals. This study assessed the capacity of local governments in Australia to plan for natural hazards. Many Local Government Areas (LGAs) had satisfactory or good hazard planning provision, but remoteness, land area and council size influence poor hazard planning provision. Strategic intent for land use planning as a DRR mechanism is unlikely to be successful in many LGAs without first addressing place-based capacity constraints on hazard planning. © 2021 The Author(s).

Abstract: South Australia is the driest state in the driest inhabited country in the world, Australia. Consequently, water is one of South Australia's highest priorities. Focus on water research and sources of water in the state became more critical during the Millenium drought that occurred between 1997 and 2011. In response to increased concern about water sources the South Australian government established The Goyder Institute for Water Research - a partnership between the South Australian State Government, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Flinders University, University of Adelaide and University of South Australia. The Goyder Institute undertakes cutting-edge science to inform the development of innovative integrated water management strategies to ensure South Australia's ongoing water security and enhance the South Australian Government's capacity to develop and deliver science-based policy solutions in water management. This paper focuses on the integrated water resource assessment of the northern Adelaide region, including the key research investments in water and climate, and how this information is being utilised by decision makers in the region. © Author(s) 2016.

Abstract: This chapter summarises the account of the policy. It is argued that the Rudd Government understood the appearance of a wave of large investments into the Australian raw resource sector as a threat to Australian sovereignty as it disrupted the Government’s capacity for liberal economic governance. It further understood its control over resources needed by the Chinese state as a point of strategic leverage and used this to attempt to open a conversation about the future trajectory of the regional order. The aim was to impress upon the Chinese Government that the new order needed to be actively created rather than passively arrived at, and that it was in China’s and other states’ interest that interstate interactions were made on the basis of liberal markets. © 2019, The Author(s).

Abstract: Of the variety of ways governments, organisations and artists are embedding art and culture within rural tourism strategy, public art trails have emerged as a popular form and approach. However, rural and remote local governments face challenges in realising possible benefits of arts tourism for their communities. This article takes remote northern Australia art tourism initiative, the Savannah Way Art Trail, as a case study to consider principles for successfully connecting public art trails with tourism in remote communities. Processes of delivering the Savannah Way Art Trail are framed and discussed under three themes: 1) local government capacity and relationships; 2) listening to locals; and 3) the ‘art’ of creating and managing remote art trails. These themes are considered as recommendations that can provide ways to enact cultural policy in practice in remote communities, and opportunities for extending the potential for art trails to reflect and benefit those communities. © 2024 The Author(s).

Abstract: This paper explores sovereign risk preferences against direct and indirect natural disasters losses in industrialized countries. Using Australia as a case study, the analysis compares expected disaster losses and government capacity to finance losses. Utilizing a national disaster loss dataset, extreme value theory is applied to estimate an all-hazard annual loss distribution. Unusually but critically, the dataset includes direct as well as indirect losses, allowing for the analysis to consider the oft-ignored issue of indirect losses. Expected annual losses (direct, and direct plus indirect) are overlaid with a risk-layer approach, to distinguish low, medium and extreme loss events. Each risk layer is compared to available fiscal resources for financing losses, grounded in the political reality of Australian disaster financing. When considering direct losses only, we find support for a risk-neutral preference on the part of the Australian government for low and medium loss levels, and a risk-averse preference in regard to extreme losses. When indirect losses are also estimated, we find that even medium loss levels are expected to overwhelm available fiscal resources, thereby violating the available resources assumption underlying arguments for sovereign risk neutrality. Our analysis provides empirical support for the assertion that indirect losses are a major, under-recognised concern for industrialized countries. A risk-averse preference in regard to medium and extreme loss events recommends enhanced investment in both corrective and prospective risk reduction in relation to these risks level, in particular to reduce indirect losses. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Abstract: From a ‘lucky country’ on the edge of the world, Australia and its governments felt they had weathered the pandemic storm in October 2020. But, the insular approach to combatting COVID-19 cracked in the months since. A series of critical failures in government response has been identified. These include vaccine procurement and roll-out, ‘gold standard’ contact tracing that turned out abysmal failures, debilitating border closures and an inability to coordinate policy and governance responses to Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. The liberal federal government architecture cracked—some commentators repeatedly use ‘bungled’—under the pressures in this next chapter in Australia's pandemic response. In this chapter, we do not only describe the deficiencies in the federal and state governments’ capacity to plan strategically and coordinate between data and intervention, we also show that the resilience of communities is essential in responding to crises—but to grow and thrive, proactive government policies will still be required. © TheEditor(s) (ifapplicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021, 2022.

Abstract: Aims: To explore and identify the core elements of the nurse executive role and the contribution these posts make to health service organisations in terms of quality and performance. Background: With the ongoing global reform of health services and, in particular, currently in Australia, this commentary paper explores the available evidence that explains and describes the role that nursing leaders can and do play at executive level in enabling quality services in high performing health-care organisations. Evaluation: While the overall literature is limited in relation to the role and function of nurse executives, there are strong and recurrent themes indicating that nurses by virtue of their professional background and experience can provide effective and influential input to executive boards. Executive nurses are well positioned to influence and lead professional governance, quality improvement, service transformation and change and shared governance. Conclusion: At a time when the role of nursing executives may be questioned, the evidence supports the positive impact of highly skilled nursing executives in contributing to the implementation of effective health services. Successful health services should be engaging nurse executives who have the high level of expertise, education, the best leadership and management attributes to bring the art and science of nursing to produce outcomes for organisations. Implications for nursing management: Nurse executives must remain alert to the ongoing challenges and potential questioning on the value that nurses can bring to an executive board. The framework of nursing executive influence and leadership through professional governance, quality improvement, service transformation and change and shared governance is one possible approach that nurse executives may wish to apply to articulate their contribution and value in remaining at the executive board table. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract: As cities confront increasingly complex governance problems, conceptions of urban governance are becoming progressively more receptive to grasping its dynamic and multiplex nature, its connection to multiple lines of authority and forms of power, and the socio-material assemblages through which it works. Yet, despite conceptual advances around the dynamism and heterogeneity of urban governing assemblages and their durability, much remains to be understood about the processes and devices that compose and cohere their constituent elements to generate governance capacity. We explore this limitation by deploying Foucault’s concept of ‘dispositif’ to analytically characterize how urban governance capacity is achieved around complex urban problems via processes and devices of composition and cohering. We do so by examining an emergent urban energy governance dispositif focused around top-tier commercial office space in Sydney, Australia: a key site around which multiple elements have been composed in a complex, entangled dispositif to produce effective urban governance capacity and accomplish substantive gains in office building energy performance. We characterise the socio-material elements involved and, more particularly, identify and analyse the processes and devices that compose the dispositif and cohere its governance capacity and we draw out the diverse forms of power that are immanent in these processes. These are, we argue, key steps in refining systematic understandings of the contemporary functioning and politics of the distributed urban governance of complex urban challenges. We conclude with key observations suggested by our analysis for urban governance scholarship. © The Author(s) 2020.

Abstract: Major public service reforms are underway at the national level in Australia. The reforms are being implemented progressively over a three-year period. This is the third in a series of articles looking at the implementation of these reforms and focuses on the second stage, which was supposed to be completed in 2015. The author examines the recent report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit which reviewed the development of the ‘Performance Framework’ through a series of public hearings. He explains why, for good governance, particularly in a difficult economic and budgetary climate (domestically and internationally), public interest considerations must prevail, not just in issues about ‘how’ but also about ‘what’ is being actually achieved.

Abstract: Background: The health, social and economic consequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, henceforth COVID-19) pandemic have loomed large as every national government made decisions about how to respond. The 40 Health Systems, COVID-19 (40HS, C-19) study aimed to investigate relationships between governments' capacity to respond (CTR), their response stringency, scope of COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: Data over March and April 2020 were extracted for 40 national health systems on prepandemic government CTR (Global Competitiveness Index), stringency measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker Stringency Index), approach to COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 cases and deaths (Our-World-in-Data). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis were applied to examine latent dimensions and visualize country similarities and dissimilarities. Outcomes were tested using multivariate and one-way analyses of variances and Kruskal-Wallis H tests. Results: The MDS model found three dimensions explaining 91% of the variance and cluster analysis identified five national groupings. There was no association between national governments' prepandemic CTR and the adoption of early stringent public health measures or approach to COVID-19 testing. Two national clusters applied early stringency measures and reported significantly lower cumulative deaths. The best performing national cluster (comprising Australia, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan) adopted relatively early stringency measures but broader testing earlier than others, which was associated with a change in disease trajectory and the lowest COVID-19 death rates. Two clusters (one with high CTR and one low) both adopted late stringency measures and narrow testing and performed least well in COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusion: Early stringency measures and intrinsic national capacities to deal with a pandemic are insufficient. Extended stringency measures, important in the short term, are not economically sustainable. Broad-based testing is key to managing COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).

Abstract: As literature on the ‘shadow state’ shows, the voluntary sector has long served as a necessary conduit through which states orchestrate the governance of various populations. However, relatively little is known about the active role that voluntary organisations play in shaping and mobilising the capacities of the state to advance their own projects and interests. We draw out aspects of post-structural theories of the state, and particularly assemblage thinking, that provide the conceptual and analytical tools with which to explore how voluntary organisations may exceed their common positioning as co-opted by, and subservient to, the state. Through empirical research on homelessness policy development in Australia, we show how locally embedded voluntary organisations in Australia and the United States acted strategically and engaged transnationally – through material practices and multi-sited labours – to create opportunities to shape formal state agenda at national and sub-national levels. The activities and influence of these voluntary organisations are illustrative of the assembled nature of state capacity. © The Author(s) 2019.

Abstract: Purpose: The paper aims to examine one local government’s efforts to increase local-level engagement in building community disaster resilience. Presenting the empirical evidence of stakeholder engagement activities that increase risk awareness and encourage collective action, the study addresses a key priority for the Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (Hyogo Framework for Action 2) to identify methods for increasing local-level implementation of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative, case study approach is used to explore the case in depth. A review of literature from the multidisciplinary areas of communication, social and political theory frames data collection and analysis. Data collection includes observation, document analysis and interviews with policymakers, practitioners and local stakeholders to document achievements and lessons learnt from all perspectives. Findings: Preliminary results indicate that strong political leadership and inter-departmental coordination have contributed to engaging local-level participation in disaster risk reduction in the Municipality of Amadora, Portugal. Findings indicate that the implementation of a wide spectrum of public engagement initiatives has increased awareness of hazard risks amongst specific demographic groups and improved community and government capacity to identify and implement risk reduction strategies. Research limitations/implications: As this study is a work-in-progress and data analysis is in the early stages, interview transcripts included in this paper are limited to members of the team and their Director, Amadora Town Councillor for Civil Protection Services. Practical implications: It is commonly acknowledged that to date, achievements of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2010-2015 largely remain at the national level and have not reached local levels in a substantial manner. Addressing the need for more industry-led research to explore examples of successful stakeholder participation, the paper’s findings can be used by emergency management practitioners who recognise the need to merge climate change adaptation, risk reduction and local-level engagement to encourage public participation, inclusiveness and proactive planning. Originality/value: Co-authored by an Australian academic and a member of Amadora’s Campaign Team, the paper is a combination of empirical data from one city’s practical experience to develop and implement communication strategies in developing and implementing strategies to build community disaster resilience, analysed within a framework of communication, social and political theory. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: New legislation was introduced in 2018 in Victoria, Australia to encourage the negotiation of affordable housing agreements. This change resulted in the expansion of formal and informal mechanisms for cross-sectoral affordable housing delivery. In this paper we draw on 20 interviews with housing stakeholders, focusing on the process of negotiation. We propose a novel theoretical framework to interpret capacity for collective action in a loosely regulated policy area, combining insights from negotiation theory and Institutional Capacity Development (ICD) literature. We find widespread concerns about the opaque, inefficient and potentially exploitative nature of outcomes. We also find that agreements varied across projects based on levels of trust; access to information; political capital; capacity for mutual gain; and the presence of shared rules for interacting. We conclude that competition-based negotiations may lead to increased institutional capacity while also highlighting the challenges of housing delivery in the context of institutional uncertainty. © 2022 IBF, The Institute for Housing and Urban Research.

Abstract: Food security is an issue, not only in developing countries but also in developed economies such as Australia where people from vulnerable groups cannot access affordable and appropriate food on a daily basis. Agencies emphasise the need for collaborative approaches to such complex, multi-sectoral challenges. This article analyses two inter-governmental partnership approaches facilitating local government's response to food insecurity in 12 municipalities within the state of Victoria. We focus on the partnership approaches to collaboration, processes and structures, and collective outcomes. The comparative data analysis from in-depth interviews and document analysis of project-associated materials and municipal policies provides insight into the different partnership approaches. Results suggest that while strategically designed and focused inter-governmental partnerships can build local government capacity to respond to food security, there are systemic, regulatory, and resource barriers in play. In conclusion, the implications of these findings for future inter-governmental approaches to address complex challenges are considered. © 2016 Institute of Public Administration Australia

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The changing institutions of private rental housing: An international review

Abstract: The report This is a report of international comparative research into the institutions of private rental housing and how they are changing. The research was conducted as part of AHURI's Inquiry into The future of the Private Rental Sector (AHURI Inquiry 51120). We take a 'system-embedded' approach to international comparative analysis which considers the particular PRS policy settings and institutions of the reference countries in the context of their housing and wider socio-economic systems. For our international review we looked at the 10 countries (Figure 1), with a detailed review of four (Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom and United States). We took a broad view of 'institutions', to include: • housing and socio-economic system factors, such as housing form, housing markets, household form and economic performance • financial settings, such as housing credit, taxation and subsidies • landlords and managers, both individual persons and large corporations • regulation, with a focus on laws regarding security of tenure and rents. Key findings and policy implications The international comparative literature shows that private rental housing, once regarded as a sector in terminal decline, is now mostly growing and diversifying, changing in some cases rapidly. Conventional typologies put forward in housing research are being overtaken by changes in the PRS and wider housing systems. A rising theme in the literature is the 'financialisation of housing', which refers to the increasing importance of housing in financial markets and the increasing participation of households in finance, particularly through leveraging property ownership for consumption or investment. Studies of PRS regulation indicate a diversity of approaches to questions of rent regulation and security of tenure. From our 10-country survey, and from closer examination of changes in Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), our key findings and their implications for PRS policy development are summarised below. Housing system contexts Private rental housing is the second largest tenure after owner occupation in all but one of the countries we reviewed (only in Germany is the PRS larger). In 7 of the 10 countries, the PRS share is growing, mostly at the expense of owner occupation, and nowhere is it significantly contracting. Wider system contexts-such as population growth, economic growth, house prices and household debt levels-vary across the countries. Germany is exceptional for its extended period of stable house prices; other countries have had booms and some have had booms and busts. In all countries house prices are rising again. Australia is unusual for having had a long escalation in house prices and no recession-and now the highest level of household debt of the 10 countries. In most countries, the profile of the PRS mostly tends towards apartments, small households and lower incomes. In this regard Australia stands out for having a PRS that is less differentiated from the wider Australian housing system than that in most other countries, in terms of building types, household form and household incomes. Policy implications The relatively high degree of resemblance between the profiles of the PRS and wider housing system in Australia implies a high degree of integration, particularly between private rental and owner-occupier markets. Hence, the policy settings and market conditions which apply to one may be transmitted readily to the other. Australian housing policy discussions are usually directed to improving affordability; it would be wise to think also about how to conduct equitable housing policy in a post-crash market. The integration between the Australian PRS and owner-occupied sectors heightens the prospect of investment in both sectors collapsing with little established institutional capacity for counter-cyclical investment that makes necessary additions to supply. The question of managing and relieving housing-related debt involves doing justice not only between creditors and debtors, but between debtor and non-debtor households. Financial settings Across the 10 countries, housing investment is mostly financed by credit, which is mostly provided by banks. Over the past two decades, housing credit has expanded-albeit punctuated by the GFC-with the development of new funding sources. Following the GFC, nine of the countries surveyed have implemented housing-specific macroprudential tools as a financial stability measure. In those countries most affected by the GFC, government programs for the disposal of impaired property-related assets have significantly increased the position of large corporations in the PRS, both directly as landlords (as in the United States) and indirectly as owners of loans with PRS properties pledged. The responses of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States to their financial and housing crises have enabled some existing owner-occupiers and large financial institutions to increase their position in the housing market, though with some curbs around riskier bank lending. This may be no more sustainable or equitable than the pre-GFC housing credit expansion. Looking at the range of tax settings applicable to housing and the PRS, we find some surprising results. Australia and Germany share several settings: both countries exempt owner-occupied housing from capital gains and both provide for negative gearing on similar terms. Yet Australia's and Germany's treatment of negative gearing and capital gains tax underlie quite different housing market outcomes: speculative inflation in Australia; relatively steady housing prices in Germany. In some respects, Australia has stronger settings against speculation: for example, land value tax. Significantly, we identified that eight of the 10 countries have recently introduced or reformed their tax regimes to provide for real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are emerging as a significant vehicle for PRS investment funding. The major form of direct subsidy in the PRS is rent assistance payments. These were made in all 10 countries to tenants-and hence indirectly to their landlords. Some countries also provide specific-purpose subsidies to PRS landlords: Germany provides low-interest loans for energy efficiency modifications and Ireland pays landlords for low-income housing through its Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). The United Kingdom's 'Build to Rent' incentives, which include loan and income guarantees, may be outweighed by its austerity-driven reduction in demand-subsidies paid to low-income tenants, which has significantly reduced the rental revenue base represented by that cohort in recent years. Germany avoided the combined financial and housing crises experienced elsewhere because of a range of institutional factors, including its conservative home lending sector and the withdrawal of some housing subsidies. It may be that some features, such as negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions, have a speculative potential which is active in other contexts, but not in the specific German context of an historically enduring large PRS, low population growth, conservative public financial institutions and rent regulation. In trying to shape the housing outcomes of a growing PRS, Ireland has taken a strategic approach that joins subsidies and regulation. Policy implications Particularly in countries that experienced a housing crash, finance settings have driven rapid change in PRS institutions, often without guidance from conventional housing policy objectives. Macroeconomic policy should look further than its effects on financial system stability or housing market levels to keep in view its effects on housing system institutions and housing policy objectives. This applies not just in responding to crises: for example, the specific effects of housing-related macroprudential tools on the investment strategies and borrowing practices of PRS landlords is worthy of investigation. Of all the policy settings considered in this review, tax settings show best the necessity of considering policy settings in interaction with each other and in wider systemic contexts. It is the interactions which explain how similar tax settings can operate and shape housing outcomes differently: for example, negative gearing facilitating housing speculation in Australia and housing affordability in Germany. Strategy for the PRS should join consideration of finance, taxation, supply and demand-side subsidies and regulation with the objective of making PRS housing outcomes competitive with other sectors. Landlords Smallholding private individuals are the predominant type of landlord in nine countries: only in Sweden are housing companies more common. Most countries, however, also have some large corporate landlords (LCLs), and a few have recently seen rapid growth in very large new LCLs. The origins of LCLs are diverse, but their recent activity has been facilitated by government activities: in Germany, municipal housing privatisation; in the United States and Ireland, post-GFC programs for the disposal of impaired assets. The rising LCLs are not building much rental housing. Rather, they are mostly acquiring existing properties and actively manage their portfolios through renovations, modifications and sales. The LCLs have been active also in mergers and, especially in the United States, in devising new financial instruments. LCLs are often controversial and there is evidence of conflictual relations with tenants, particularly in Germany and the United States. Policy implications 'Institutional landlords'-the LCLs-are now a standing item on the Australian housing policy agenda. Policy makers and stakeholders in the PRS should start specifying what sorts of LCLs are really wanted, and how desired housing outcomes will be delivered. Recent affordable housing policy initiatives have sought to develop community housing providers into a sector of large-scale, mission-oriented landlords. Care should be taken to ensure that these initiatives are not colonised by for-profit LCLs at the expense of affordable housing providers and outcomes. Regulation The view of tenancy regulation as 'red tape' is out of step with the recent experience of most countries in this study. None of the recent growth in the PRS in the countries surveyed has been prompted or unleashed by deregulation (though arguably the United Kingdom's reforms of the late 1980s had such an effect). On the contrary, Ireland and Scotland are examples of successively stronger regulation being implemented as the PRS has grown. Only Spain has recently liberalised its tenancy laws. The foremost approach to assuring tenants' security is to allow landlords to terminate on prescribed grounds only. This is the situation currently in Germany, Sweden, Scotland, most of the Canadian provinces and some major US cities. Only Belgium and Spain rely on long fixed terms and Ireland has a unique regime of cyclical restrictions on termination by landlords. Only Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (other than Scotland) and some US jurisdictions allow termination without grounds. Notably, the State of Victoria in Australia is legislating to remove the provision for termination for no specified reason end the end of the first fixed term of an agreement. Rent increases are regulated in four countries-Belgium, Germany, Spain and Sweden-most of the Canadian provinces and some major US cities by limiting them to a stated guideline or reference rent. Ireland and Scotland do so in designated 'rent pressure zones'. Registers are an old regulatory technology which have been given a new lease of life in several countries with public registers of private landlords, in particular, providing a mechanism for monitoring and lifting standards of conduct. Policy implications The view of tenancy regulation as 'red tape' is out of step with the recent experience of most countries in this study. Smallholding individual landlords and LCLs operate without undue difficulty in more strongly regulated PRSs than Australia's. The use of prescribed grounds for termination is consistent with Australian PRS institutional structures and could be adopted here; similarly, market-related rent regulations (e.g. limitation to guidelines or indices) could operate in combination with conventional Australian tax settings. The extension of registration requirements to mainstream PRS landlords could address some problems posed by smallholding landlords and LCLs, respectively. The study We reviewed international changes in the institutions of private rental housing through three phases of research: • a review of the international comparative literature • a 10-country survey, involving experts in each reference country and follow-up research • analysis of detailed country reports by experts in four countries commissioned for this research. The first phase of our study was a review of the comparative literature and national studies of PRSs around the world. Our review of the literature was ongoing throughout the project with the second and third phases of the study directing our attention to further national-level sources. The second phase was a survey of PRS institutions and change in the 10 countries, including Australia. A questionnaire about PRS institutions and change was devised and sent to experts in the nine international reference countries. Survey responses for Australia were provided as a guide to response formats. The international responses provided a rich source of data and additional resources which we interrogated to identify themes in institutional change for closer examination in the third phase of our research. The third phase comprised closer examination of four countries-Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States-as case studies of the themes in PRS institutional change identified in the literature review and survey. We commissioned four experts-Stefan Kofner (Germany), Aideen Hayden (Ireland), Mark Stephens (UK) and Alex Schwartz (US)-to each write a report on their respective country according to these themes of change, which the research team then used to produce a synthesis analysis of institutional change. The four country reports are appended to this report. © Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute Limited 2018.

Abstract: Public spaces are the loci of complex interactions among multiple stakeholders whose decisions and activities affect places' qualities. The paper builds upon governance theory to provide a holistic in-depth approach in understanding the complexity and quality of the place-shaping processes in public spaces. In the absence of adequate conception of governance in urban design and public spaces, the paper introduces a framework for analysing governance capacity of public spaces and applies the framework to a flagship but highly contested public space in Brisbane, Australia namely South Bank Parklands. The proposed framework encompasses four major components of 1) actors and stakeholders, 2) governance structure, 3) governing tools, and 4) governing tasks. The framework puts special emphasis on the contextual factors, the way public spaces are shaped and governed, and political economy of the space. The case study application showcases the applicability of the PSGF which helps holistically analyse the trends in public space governance structure accounting for the diversity and complexity of all elements involved. The findings reveal that South Bank Parklands governance is mix-structured, hierarchical, and highly political. It is, however, a likeable public space for which civic engagement in the decision-making processes is notably limited. © 2018

Abstract: Our newly constructed index of corporate governance quality (CGQ) provides comprehensive and robust evidence for the association between CGQ and stock liquidity in the pure order-driven Australia market. By using a large sample of 1207 firms from 2001 to 2013, we find a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have greatly improved stock liquidity. Specifically, we find that better governed firms have a lower trading cost, smaller price impacts of trade, and higher trading speed. Moreover, the empirical results reveal that CGQ improves stock liquidity because it is associated with higher information disclosure. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract: In view of past environmental degradation and anticipated climate change impacts, we assessed the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. In a workshop with staff from three Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) who had jurisdiction over three sub-basins, as well as technical experts, nine adaptation options were identified that ranged from environmental flows, restoring river channel habitat, reoperating infrastructure and controlling invasive species. A Catchment Adaptation Framework was developed and used to assess and compare these adaptation options with each of the CMAs, drawing on interviews with their key stakeholders, to identify the risks, benefits and costs. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation can augment catchment management programs and requires investment in a suite of different but complementary measures to lower risk. Our research found institutional challenges in implementing this approach, including the complexities of multi-agency management, constricting legal requirements, narrow funding arrangements, under-developed institutional capacity, difficulties of implementing catchment-scale programs on private property and the need to adhere to community expectations. These institutional issues are ubiquitous internationally and point to the wider issues of providing sufficient management capacity to support adaptation. The Catchment Adaptation Framework presented here enables river basin managers to systematically assess the adaptation options to better inform their decision-making. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: To generate innovative solutions for marine sustainability challenges, scientists, policymakers, and funders are increasingly calling for interdisciplinary research that transcends disciplinary boundaries. However, challenges associated with doing interdisciplinary research persist and undermine progress toward tackling the complex challenges faced by marine social-ecological systems. One barrier for engaging in effective interdisciplinary research is a lack of understanding about the institutional capacities that support interdisciplinary knowledge production. Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with members of the Centre for Marine Socioecology in Australia, we identify five principles that underpin effective interdisciplinary research organizations. The principles are: (1) support female leadership; (2) forge partnerships outside of academia; (3) develop impact-based performance metrics; (4) focus on long-term funding; and (5) cultivate a visible brand. Going forward, these principles could be used to inform organizational design that transforms institutional barriers into enablers of innovative interdisciplinary research for more sustainable, desirable, and equitable futures. © Copyright © 2020 Blythe and Cvitanovic.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Farming smarter with big data: Insights from the case of Australia's national dairy herd milk recording scheme

Abstract: Digitalization and the use of Smart Farming Technologies are considered a major opportunity for the future of agriculture. However, realisation of full benefits is constrained by: (1) farmers' interest in and use of big data to improve farm decision making; (2) issues of data sovereignty and trust between providers and users of data and technology; (3) institutional arrangements associated with the governance of data platforms. This paper examines the case of Australia's dairy herd milk recording system, arguably one of agriculture's first cases of ‘big data’ use, which collects, analyses and uses farm-level data (milk production, lactation and breeding records) to provide individual cow and herd performance information, used by individual farmers for farm management decisions. The aim of this study was to 1) examine the use of big data to add value to farm decision making; and 2) explore factors and processes, including institutional arrangements, which influence farmer engagement with and use of big data. This paper traces the Australian history of the organisation of dairy herd recording (established in 1912 and digitalized in late 1970s) and then uses findings from a longitudinal study of 7 case study dairy farms, which were incentivised to become involved in herd recording in 2015. Applying a conceptual framework linking path dependency in farm decision making and collaborative governance capacity, we find three new important dimensions of the farm user context influencing farmer demand for big data applications: 1) the transition to a new business stage; 2) the additionality farmers seek from data generated in one component of the farm system to other subsystems, and 3) the use of data in long term or strategic decision making. Further, we identified critical attributes of support services in addressing digital literacy, capacity and capability issues at farm level, including diversity in data presentation formats and facilitation of the on-farm transition process through intermediary herd test organisations. The role of farmers as governance actors, or citizens in the decisions of the trajectory of big data applications, adds to understanding of the nature of collaborative governance arrangements that support farm engagement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: Urban partnerships are an instrument of urban governance common in major urban development projects. However, the potential for these traditional urban policy instruments to promote climate-adapted greenfield development remains largely untested. This study examines this potential through an analysis of four urban development partnerships for master-planned estates in two rapidly urbanising regions of Australia. We interview private property developers, government land organisations and municipal level actors. The analysis focuses on the convergence, and tensions, between partners' goals of affordability, profitability and sustainability; benefits and risks of partnering; and, the management of assets over time, in light of environmental risks. The partnerships studied contributed to the state's capacity to implement policy efficiently, encourage innovation and de-risk projects for private partners. However, these initiatives also transferred longer term environmental risks to the broader planning system and to non-partners. The central role of the state in coordinating these arrangements presents opportunities to redress these limitations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

Abstract: Using an index of corporate governance quality (CGQ), we provide the first robust evidence of the determinants of stock liquidity in Australia. We assume that CGQ affects stock liquidity because effective governance decreases information asymmetries between insiders (e.g. managers) and outsiders (e.g. investors), as well as among outsiders, by improving information transparency of a firm. Consistent with agency theory, this study, using 435 large capitalization firms over the period from 2001 to 2008, finds a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have a higher level of stock liquidity. These findings are robust to alternative proxies of CGQ, stock liquidity and endogeneity bias. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract: Vietnamese ‘blue boats’ – small wooden-hulled fishing boats – are now entering the territorial waters of Pacific Island countries and illegally catching high-value species found on remote coastal reefs. Crossing several international boundaries and traversing a distance of over 5000 km, these intrusions have alarmed Oceanic countries, including Australia. Lacking administrative capacity as well as jurisdictional authority to effectively control the vast stretches of island coastlines individually, governments and intergovernmental bodies in the region have called for strengthened coordination of surveillance efforts while also pressuring Vietnam diplomatically. This paper reviews these latest developments and is the first to provide a focused assessment of the issue. Through the lens of Copenhagen School of securitisation theory, we analyse responses of national and regional actors and their portrayal in online media to understand how blue boats are constructed as a security threat within a narrative of maritime, food and human security. Arguably, Australia together with the Forum Fisheries Agency, who advise on the governance of offshore tuna resources, have so far acted most decisively – in a way that might see them extend their strategic role in the region. We propose a comprehensive empirical research agenda to better understand and manage this nascent, flammable and largely unpredictable inter-regional phenomenon. © 2019 The Authors.

Abstract: This article analyses expectations and experiences of digital public spaces that facilitate community engagement with urban planning. While viewing digital spaces as part of an expanding repertoire of public spaces and events – physical and digital – that signify theparticipatory turn in municipal governance, we argue that local officials and residents are overly optimistic about the democratic and administrative capacities of the digital sphere. Through a case study from Melbourne, Australia – a city with significant growth pressures – we argue that the experience of new participatory digital platforms falls short of expectations, for both residents and officials. Data show that well-documented problems with established modes of community engagement such as agenda control and ‘black boxing’ of responses, are replicated in on-line settings. The wariness residents have of administrators and elected officials are overlaid by new concerns of digital distrust and digital exclusion. For officials, using these digital spaces effectively requires time to develop and apply new skills. Our study suggests that digital spaces are not homogenous but are made up of diverse and complex practices and interrelationships The multiplex relationships making up these digital spaces suggest that strategic and contextual combinations of online and offline engagement may be a path towards inclusive and democratic community engagement. © 2021, Articulo - Journal of Urban Research.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE:To provide reference for improving the supporting system of drug safety governance in China. METHODS:Through analyzing the main ways,characteristics and effectiveness of drug safety governance in Australia,the suggestions for building drug safety governance system in China were put forward initially. RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS:The methods of Australia’s drug safety governance are to conduct division of labor between the federal and state/territory governments,conduct policy consultations with different related entities separately,guide industry self-discipline based on industrial development level,and support industry to participate in drug advertising supervision. Australia’s drug safety governance has the characteristics of large information sharing channels,increasing the transparency of government work,carrying out targeted education and enhancing the governance capacity of participants etc. It has achieved significant improvement in the occurrence of drug recall events,and significant increase in the satisfaction of stakeholders in the communication activities of drug regulatory authorities. In contrast,the participation consciousness and ability of relevant entities in China are still not strong,and the system to ensure the participation of these entities is not yet sound. It is recommended that China should pay more attention to the communication between the upper and lower levels of governments,conduct targeted education or training for principals of non-government entities, implement the policy consultation rights of non-government entities, as well as guide self-discipline based on self-management ability of industry entities so as to initially establish drug safety governance system in China,and enhance the governance efficiency. © 2020 Editorial Office of China Pharmacy.

Abstract: Responsibility for solving collective action problems in invasive species control has conventionally been assigned to government. The large continuing costs arising from invasive species demonstrate the limitations of government-centred (monocentric) approaches to governance in this domain, and indicate a need for polycentric alternatives which complement government capacities with those of landholders and their community organisations. We sought to add to existing knowledge about collective action problems for invasive species management, and to explore the potential for community-based, polycentric approaches to improve management in this domain, through workshops and a survey of landholders regarding the weed serrated tussock (Nassella trichotoma) in two regions of New South Wales, Australia. Serrated tussock threatens the private interests of a substantial proportion of landholders in the two regions. Private landholders recognise how management of this weed on their own properties poses a collective action problem, where success is dependent on the diligent control efforts of neighbouring private and public landholders. They are more likely to consider issues relating to horizontal social capital (e.g. relationships with public and private neighbours) as barriers to effective serrated tussock control on their own property, than issues relating to information and education about this species. Community-based approaches to this weed have the potential to improve its management across the landscape, and a great majority of private landholders appear willing to participate in such a program. Such an approach will require the active participation of public land managers, continued coercion of non-cooperative landholders, and can be developed from the foundation of existing institutional arrangements for land management, taking into account unique regional relationships and characteristics. It should complement and build on, rather than replace existing legislative, research, and extension approaches. © 2016.

Abstract: Background: One Health approach advocates realizing the best health and harmonious symbiosis of human, animal and natural environment through cross-border, multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation. The good governance model is the leading factor for the performance of One Health governance. In order to tackle the complex problems in the One Health governance at the global level, the variation of One Health governance in different countries was analyzed by a set of indicators within the One Health system. Method: The capacity of One Health governance was assessed after establishment of a set of indicators for the One Health governance index (OHGI) following the methodology of the global One Health index. The data to calculate OHGI was collected from various database sources, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and official health-related institutions of various countries. Eight indicators (including 19 sub-indicators) were employed in the OHGI system to comprehensively evaluate the capacity of One Health governance in 146 countries of the world. Results: Among the 146 countries scored in the OHGI system, the average score was 34.11, with a median score of 31.49, ranged from 8.50 to 70.28. Most countries with higher OHGI scores come from Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific and North America, while countries with the lower OHGI scores are almost from sub-Saharan Africa. Six countries scored more than 65 points, including Australia, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, the United States of America and Finland, indicating that these countries are relatively mature in most aspects of One Health governance. However, there were some developing countries with OHGI scored lower than 15. Therefore, the gap between countries with higher OHGI scores and those with lower OHGI scores is more than 60. Conclusions: Good governance on One Health is an important indicator to measure One Health’s governance capacity. The political stability, the level of rule of law and economic conditions in different regions are significantly correlated with the One Health governance capacity. Actions need to be taken urgently to close the gap of One Health governance between different regions. © 2023, The Author(s).

Abstract: Objectives Diabetic eye disease is a leading cause of blindness but can be mitigated by regular eye assessment. A framework of issues, developed from the literature of barriers to eye assessment, was used to structure an examination of perceptions of a new model of care for diabetic retinopathy from the perspective of staff using the model, and health professionals referring patients to the new service. Design Multimethod: interviews and focus groups, and a separate survey. Setting A new clinic based on an integrated model of care was established at a hospital in outer metropolitan Sydney, Australia in 2017. Funded jointly by Centre for Eye Health (CFEH) and the hospital, the clinic was equipped and staffed by optometrists who work alongside the ophthalmologists in the existing hospital eye clinic. Participants Five (of seven) hospital staff working in the clinic (ophthalmologists and administrative officers) or referring to it from other departments (endocrinologists); nine optometrists from CFEH who developed or worked in the clinic; 10 community-based optometrists as potential referrers. Results The new clinic was considered to have addressed known barriers to eye assessment, including access, assistance for patients unable/unwilling to organise eye checks and efficient management of human resources. The clinic optimised known drivers of this model of care: providing clear scope of practice and protocols for shared care between optometrists and ophthalmologists, good communication between referrers and eye professionals and a collegial approach promoting interprofessional trust. Remaining areas of concern were few referrals from general practitioners, fewer referrals from hospital endocrinologists than expected and issues with stretched administrative capacity. There were also perceived mismatches between the priorities of hospital management and aims of the clinic. Conclusions The new model was considered to have addressed many of the barriers to assessment. While there remain issues with the model, there were also unexpected benefits. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Abstract: Understanding citizens’ use and trust in media are essential during a global health crisis when governments need to provide reliable information to enact public measures to reduce rates of illness and death. This chapter examines these relationships through repeated surveys in two comparable liberal democracies, the USA and Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It finds that news engagement increased markedly in both countries in 2020 during the pandemic with television and newspapers being the most relied upon sources. Media trust was higher for citizens who prioritized established news sources and medical experts for coronavirus information. Yet, there is clear evidence that people’s news preferences are associated with their level of concern about the virus and support for government measures to contain it. Trump supporters were more inclined to trust information from family and friends on social media than from professional journalists. They were the group least concerned about catching the virus and most dissatisfied with government lockdown measures. The chapter finds greater political and media polarization and partisan distrust of experts in the USA compared to Australia. It concludes that polarization has serious real-world consequences for governments’ capacities to protect public health in this time of crisis. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Peter Van Aelst and Jay G.

Abstract: Indicator-based frameworks for assessing the sustainability of commercial fisheries have become well-established in the consumer sector. Within fisheries management, there are only a few jurisdictions, notably Australia, where sustainability frameworks are regularly used across the full spectrum of management functions, including planning, decision making, and evaluation. In Canada, a “sustainable fisheries framework” has been proposed but implementation has been limited to date. The Canadian Fisheries Research Network (CFRN), a six-year collaboration between Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the commercial fishing industry, and academic institutions, included as one of its major outputs the development of a comprehensive framework-based approach to evaluate the sustainability of commercial fisheries in Canada. Although most fisheries sustainability frameworks focus on the ecological domain, the CFRN explicitly recognized the social, economic, and institutional domains as having equal importance in a holistic treatment of sustainability. Following an iterative research and development process, a subgroup within the CFRN produced a novel sustainability indicator framework that combines a hierarchical subject matter structure consisting of domains, dimensions, and elements with a formula approach to developing indicators that utilizes a system of variables, or attributes. These two aspects of the sustainability indicator framework are linked in a way that helps to enforce comprehensive and routine methods for identifying objectives and relating those to specific indicators. The careful balancing of scope and depth makes for a powerful tool that can be used across a range of fisheries management contexts within Canada and in other jurisdictions that have a similar governance structure and high degree of institutional capacity. We present a detailed account of how the sustainability indicator framework was developed, the logic of its construction, and its potential application in fisheries management. © 2019 by the author(s).

Abstract: Australian local government does not enjoy the status of its counterparts in comparable democracies and has long sought acknowledgment in the federal constitution. As these campaigns have consistently failed, this study considers how, and in which forms, local government obtains its own political legitimacy within a governance system centered on the citizen–state relationship, in addition to evaluating the relationships between the different forms of legitimacy. We find that positive perceptions of local government effectiveness are associated with higher levels of support for constitutional change, but that local governments need to pay more attention to systems of accountability and oversight, how building and planning issues are handled, and how they communicate with residents. Generally, and unsurprisingly, local government is appreciated more by those who rely on their services yet who are not always the loudest voices in public debates. Constitutional legitimacy is more likely when other sources of legitimacy are enhanced.

Abstract: Bordering practices have been a central and controversial feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Closed borders, lockdowns, and restrictions on movement and individual "freedoms”have revived concepts of the biopo- litical "state of exception”and state control. In this article, we argue that biopolitical critiques of responses to the pandemic fail to grasp the op- portunity to rethink worldmaking and instead base their critiques on a desired "return to normal”which foregrounds human-centric individual- ism at the expense of alternative worldmaking that accounts for the more- than-human. To do so, we bring the virus and the virome into our discus- sion to rethink bordering practices and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects bodies, worlds, and politics. We focus primarily on the Australian case, where the pandemic response began with lockdowns and then gave way to a militarized and individualistic approach. Responses to the pandemic have failed to produce a reimagining of human and more-than-human re- lations. Opportunities for ethical engagement have been missed, resulting in limited responses that stem from the failure of state capacity and en- trenched modes of inequality that are harmful to vulnerable others, both human and more-than-human. This requires an ontological reframing of how we relate to a complex world from a more-than-human perspective. © The Author(s) (2024).

Abstract: The current fabric of urban areas is largely the result of past land development and land-use planning decisions. Historically, there was relatively little consideration of the impact of these decisions upon hydrological systems within and outside urban areas. Despite their close relationship, urban and regional planning and water resources management have typically been carried out separately and guided by different institutional arrangements. The range of impacts of urbanisation on hydrological systems at the city-region scale, and the dependence of urbanised areas upon these systems, call for better integration between the sectors of urban and regional planning and water resources management to ensure the sustainability and resilience of cities and their regions to future changes and uncertainties. This paper evaluates the extent to which planning mechanisms currently support integration between land-use and water resource sectors. The evaluation draws on a comparative analysis of 113 statutory and non-statutory planning mechanisms in three Australian capital city-regions: South East Queensland, and the Melbourne and Perth Metropolitan regions. Results indicate that the function of water at the city-region scale, including its role in supporting environmental connectivity, needs to be better understood and considered by land-use planning systems; improved institutional capacity is required to enable both sectors to deal with future changes and uncertainties related to water resources; and emergent planning trends supportive of the consideration of water connectivity at the city-region scale are yet to be fully implemented. Based on the results, the paper concludes by exploring how the concept of urban metabolism may facilitate better integration between the two sectors, along with the identification of best suited planning mechanisms and needed changes in governance and institutional arrangements conducive to integration. © 2016

Abstract: The purpose of this article was to explore the impacts of climate change on human health in Australia in general, and the state of Queensland in particular. We evaluated health-related services and adaptation challenges in the health sector and indicate possible remedies. The scientific consensus on the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is convincing. Climate change will have potentially devastating human health effects including increased morbidity, mortality and injury in the near future. Its impacts will be unevenly distributed among geographical regions and population groups. The elderly, children and people who are chronically ill and economically disadvantaged will be more vulnerable than others. Adaptation is a valuable tool for minimizing the effects of climate change on human health, but the mechanisms involve various societal, cultural, economic, political, environmental, information and technological challenges that need to be addressed rigorously and cautiously. Developing and designing appropriate healthcare systems to meet the challenges involved with adaptation is equally important in reducing the health effects of climate variability. There is an increased need for information about climatic impacts on human health and a need to increase institutional capacity, social and human capital, leadership, communication and partnerships as well as promoting stakeholders’ engagement in the adaptation processes in order to ensure success. © Inter-Research 2020

Abstract: Rapid urban population growth promotes the outward expansion of cities and strengthens demand for outer metropolitan infrastructure. In a practical sense, creating sustainable greenfield communities is problematic given the expensive, multidimensional nature of infrastructure. Inwardly-looking metropolitan imaginaries can result. Although urban political economy perspectives acknowledge variability in local public-private sector relations, thereby raising the prospect of developer obligations, the latter are not without limited. To further strengthen understanding of sub-national government capacities and outer metropolitan infrastructure policy, additional institutionalist interpretations are necessary. Alongside or in between the limits of developer contributions and ad hoc public funding streams, this paper confirms the importance of extended policy perspectives by identifying and evaluating three state level policy responses on the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia: spatially designated funding, public private partnerships (PPPs) and community infrastructure brokers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the experience and involvement of academics in learning analytics (LA) due to its potential for improving teaching and learning. However, findings often reflect an educational culture which is indicative of the institutional or national context where the study has occurred, resulting in bias regarding LA perspectives. Therefore, this study seeks to compare and contrast the experiences of LA among academics in Australia and Malaysia, with intentions to learn from each other's experience. Areas of comparison were: (1) academics' involvement in LA activities; (2) academics' responses to the institutional capacity in supporting LA; and 3) academics' concerns about the ethical issues surrounding LA. A survey of 353 Australian and 224 Malaysian academics revealed similarities and differences. It is evident from these results that the context and infrastructure for LA are at different stages of development in both countries. Nevertheless, the results provide an interesting reflection on academics' needs, institutional understanding, policies, and educational cultural biases in applying LA in teaching and learning in higher education institutions. © 2018 Australasian Journal of Educational Technology.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Broadening Experimentation through Research-Industry Collaboratives in the Australian Water Sector

Abstract: Whether urban climate experimentation is productive for climate-resilient sustainability transitions is determined by the extent to which experimentation provides impulses to radical change that are embedded in and strategically connected with on-going policy and planning processes, thus building on and boosting new governance capacities. We analyse the transformative and orchestrating capacities manifest in the urban climate experimenting processes in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Transformative capacity enables developing and embedding novelty. Orchestrating capacity serves to coordinate multi-actor processes to facilitate and align experimentation. While actors in Rotterdam are successfully employing experimentation as a new governance mode to address climate change, sustainability and resilience, this approach is mainly legitimised by marketing the city internationally as a frontrunner in climate adaptation. As a result, individual innovations remain stand-alone initiatives. We can identify several capacity gaps, which point to mismatches between experimentation and on-going policy and planning processes, as well as across (strategic and operational) governance levels. © Cambridge University Press 2018.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of CEO incentive-based compensation on earnings management, taking into account the influence of institutional settings and corporate governance systems. Design/methodology/approach: Using archival data of 3,000 British, Australian, German, and Austrian firm-years between 2005 and 2014, the study applies fixed-effect estimator to reduce risks of endogeneity bias. Findings: The findings reveal that institutional factors influence the relationship between CEO incentive-based compensation and earnings management. Particularly, firms from countries within the Anglo-American model (the UK and Australia), which provide greater protection for investor, stricter legal enforcement, and higher quality of corporate governance, tend to have lower level of earnings management. However, besides corporate governance quality, it is relevant to consider weaker investor protection and legal enforcement to motivate earnings management in firms from countries within the Euro-Continental model (Germany and Austria). Originality/value: The study suggests that robust implementation of corporate governance, derived from either model, helps in restraining CEO opportunistic behavior. Importantly, more qualified institutions have higher impact on the relative adequacy of CEO incentive-based pay formulas in mitigating earnings management concerns. This can be extended by future research through comparative studies using other contexts or influential institutions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss is one of the most significant drivers of ecosystem change and is projected to continue at a rapid rate. While protected areas, such as national parks, are seen as important refuges for biodiversity, their effectiveness in stemming biodiversity decline has been questioned. Public agencies have a critical role in the governance of many such areas, but there are tensions between the need for these agencies to be more “adaptive” and their current operating environment. Our aim is to analyze how institutions enable or constrain capacity to conserve biodiversity in a globally significant cross-border network of protected areas, the Australian Alps. Using a novel conceptual framework for diagnosing biodiversity institutions, our research examined institutional adaptive capacity and more general capacity for conserving biodiversity. Several intertwined issues limit public agencies’ capacity to fulfill their conservation responsibilities. Narrowly defined accountability measures constrain adaptive capacity and divert attention away from addressing key biodiversity outcomes. Implications for learning were also evident, with protected area agencies demonstrating successful learning for on-ground issues but less success in applying this learning to deeper policy change. Poor capacity to buffer political and community influences in managing significant cross-border drivers of biodiversity decline signals poor fit with the institutional context and has implications for functional fit. While cooperative federalism provides potential benefits for buffering through diversity, it also means protected area agencies have restricted authority to address cross-border threats. Restrictions on staff authority and discretion, as public servants, have further implications for deploying capacity. This analysis, particularly the possibility of fostering “ambidexterity” —creatively responding to political pressures in a way that also achieves a desirable outcome for biodiversity conservation—is one promising way of building capacity to buffer both political influences and ecological pressures. The findings and the supporting analysis provide insight into how institutional capacity to conserve biodiversity can be enhanced in protected areas in Australia and elsewhere, especially those governed by public agencies and/or multiple organizations and across jurisdictions. © 2016 by the author(s).

Abstract: Climate change is the greatest global health threat of the 21st century, with numerous direct and indirect human health consequences. Local governments play a critical role in communities’ response to climate change, both through strategies to reduce emissions and adaption plans to respond to changing climate and extreme weather events. Australian local government environmental health officers (EHOs) have the relevant skills and expertise to inform and develop adaptation plans for health protection in the context of climate change. This study used an online survey followed by phone interviews of local government management to determine the extent to which EHOs are involved in adaptation planning in health protection climate change plans. Questions were also asked to determine whether local councils are aware of EHOs’ capability to contribute and to gauge the willingness of management to provide EHOs with the workload capacity to do so. The findings demonstrated that although climate adaptation and mitigation planning is occurring in local government, it is not including or considering the public health impacts on the community. Primarily, it was found that this oversight was due to a lack of awareness of the health impacts of climate change outside of a disaster or emergency scenario. Currently, EHOs are an untapped source of knowledge and skills that can contribute to climate change adaption planning. To support this, a framework of local environmental health practice was developed to assist the reconceptualization of the scope of practice required for the planning and response to climate change. © 2023 by the authors.

Abstract: Introduction The delivery of services to improve Aboriginal health and well-being must centre culture and integrate a social and emotional well-being understanding and approaches. These approaches are essential in increasing access to, and engagement with, health services, as well as ensuring culturally safe, person-centred and community-centred care. This study will evaluate the Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia's social and emotional well-being model of service being piloted in five Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services across five of Western Australia's regions. The model of service includes the establishment of interdisciplinary social and emotional well-being teams and a four-pillar approach to service delivery. Methods and analysis An Aboriginal Participatory Action Research methodology will be undertaken which calls for Indigenous leadership and governance, capacity-building of community co-researchers and engagement in reflexive practice. The evaluation will take a mixed-methods approach to data collection, including at each pilot site, yarns with up to five clients engaging with social and emotional well-being services; qualitative interviews with up to five service providers at each site, and up to five key knowledge holders from stakeholders including funders and commissioning bodies; the collection of clinical data; facilitated discussion using the social and emotional well-being Systems Assessment Tool; and document analysis and cost-estimation. Analysis will be guided by a client journey mapping framework, and data will be collectively analysed through a socioecological framework to understand the connections and inter-relatedness between client outcomes and experiences, social and emotional well-being team and service provider experiences, service systems and governance structures. Ethics and dissemination This evaluation was approved by the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (HREC1204). The findings will be disseminated through the production of an evaluation report and academic publications and presentations. Findings will also be disseminated through community forums and plain language summaries. These outputs will detail evaluation findings and recommendations, the process of evaluation through an Aboriginal Participatory Action Research approach and the collaborative stakeholder relationship-building that underpinned the project.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Towards institutional fit? The reality of institutional capacity through two food security exemplars

Abstract: Global challenges face many local governments, which in turn, need to rapidly build their capacity to respond. Local government requires alignment with organizational partners, higher levels of government, external societal actors and local constituents, through the concept of institutional fit, to acquire the capacity to respond to global challenges. Institutional fit discursively enables local government to increase its reach and collective capacity. We analysed institutional fit in two local government case studies in Australia that aimed to improve food security through addressing equity and other social aspects to the challenge. Case study analysis was based on in-depth interviews, primary document analysis and secondary data analysis pertaining to the food security initiatives. Findings show that collaborative partnerships can provide greater understanding of the goals, roles and higher-level commitment needed for institutional fit. Aligning capacities and roles between and within organizations and institutions is also required because local government is severely restricted without whole-of-institutional commitment to similar goals. We found, however, that local government is constrained in its response to change because of the complex nature of the challenge and because neoliberalism militates against fit within the wider domain of the entire institutional response. We argue that institutional fit needs to be embedded within any change process. More nuanced and targeted understandings of the roles of each organization can then be understood, along with the role of power within the institutional domain, so that appropriate planning occurs to identify and target which responses are achieved and by whom. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Community-Centred Environmental Discourse: Redefining Water Management in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia

Abstract: The Australian government's response to the Millennium Drought (1997–2010) has been met with praise and contestation. While proponents saw the response as timely and crucial, critics claimed it was characterized by government overreach and mismanagement. Five months of field research in farm communities in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) identified two dominant discourses: administrative rationalism and a local community-based discourse I have termed community-centrism. Administrative rationalism reflects the value of scientific inquiry in service to the state and is the dominant research-based problem-solving model used by water and natural resource agencies (Dryzek in The politics of the earth: environmental discourses, Oxford University Press, 2013; Colloff and Pittock in Aust J Water Resour, 23(2):88–98, 2019). Community-centrism was identified through discussions with farmers and represents a bottom-up approach to environmental planning and management that seeks to incorporate local knowledge, planning, and direct participation. This investigation reveals how discourses define problems and policy choices. While market-based government interventions were likely necessary to address the crisis in the MDB, community-centred responses could have enhanced the government’s capacity to respond to problems. This paper argues that the long-term sustainability of water management in the Basin will require a reorientation on the part of farmers, academics, and governments to develop a community-centred approach to water policies impacting agriculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

Abstract: Innovative design labs were created by public authorities of the USA, Australia, Singapore, Finland, Canada, the UK, Switzerland, Denmark, China, and other countries to accelerate changes and develop modern public service. This paper provides further insight to establishing external innovation accelerators for strengthening capacity of public institutions. The study aims to define the development opportunities for innovative design labs for the public sector in Ukraine's regions by the case of the Laboratory of Intellectual Development for Empowering Regions (LIDER). The study was conducted at two stages: (1) exploring the features of innovation implementation in the public sector and outlining the main problems of innovation capacity of public institutions; (2) defining the development opportunities for the LIDER via SWOTanalysis. To substantiate the study results, the correlation analysis between autocratic, bureaucratic, competitive, self-protective, and participative leadership behaviors of CEOs and innovation index based on data from 18 countries was performed, as well as a survey of 195 public servants of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine and an interview of 9 experts were conducted. The following key development opportunities for the LIDER were detected: Promoting the introduction of incremental innovations in public institutions by using design thinking methodology; assisting the development of pro-innovative culture and participative leadership via individual-centric and system-oriented approaches; developing effective tools for performance management and supporting public institutions in project activity; organizing the competitions for regional innovative projects; assisting in creation of radically human systems in public institutions. © Dmytro Dzvinchuk, Mariana Orliv, Brigita Janiunaite, Victor Petrenko, 2021.

Abstract: Background: Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are increasing worldwide. This is especially paramount in low and middle income countries in which ESRD patients are struggling to access specialist services e.g. hemodialysis (HD). Benchmarking analysis of the offered healthcare packages in several countries and comparison of the utilized alternative healthcare models for ESRD patients may be auspicious for institutional capacity-building in the existing healthcare facilities. Main aim of this study was to perform a benchmarking and evidence-informed gap analysis of the ESRD care provision in Iran and recognize the gaps that cause diversification in care quality for ESRD patients that hinder efforts for care quality improvement in the Iranian National Healthcare System. Methods: Dimensions of the Australian Anglicare Southern Queensland Clinical and Care Governance Framework (ASQCGF) were utilized as corner stones of a comprehensive clinical care plan that is essential in responding to HD patients’ needs in Iran. An extensive literature search was performed at the next stage to recognize the gold standard core elements. The ascertained components were assigned to the five separate dimensions of the ASQCGF and a preliminary draft (comprehensive package of care for HD patients) was prepared. A checklist was developed at a later stage which was sent to a panel of expert consisting professional healthcare providers in nephrology and hemodialysis wards for their opinions. A gap analysis was conducted to evaluate current care processes of the Iranian HD patients align with the elements of the gold standard framework. Results: The identified deficits were classified in five areas in accord with the elements of ASQCGF as follow: A) supply of resources, medical devices and equipment support B) recruitment and endorsement of clinics and general work force C) infection prevention and controlling procedures D) care effectiveness monitoring and quality improvement E) provision of safe environment for both HD patients and hospitals’ staff. Conclusions: The study findings revealed considerable gaps in providing quality HD services to the Iranian HD patients that herald their therapeutic unmet needs and the shift that is needed to narrow down the widening organizational failure which fuels the current disenchantment among the both healthcare providers and HD patients. © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract: How does local experience of climate change alter voters' policy preferences and voting decisions? After exposure to a climate disaster, voters may elect politicians prioritising robust disaster prevention policies, or conversely, immediate economic relief. In turn, elected representatives will either mitigate or exacerbate the severity of future climate events. In this study, I leverage a climate event with a high degree of local geographic variation – a pre-election drought in Australia – to see how it shaped political beliefs and behaviours in 2019. Using a longitudinal panel survey, I show that voters in drought-exposed areas increasingly prioritised individual economic security, rather than broader climate-mitigation policies. Moreover, I find that regional micro-parties in drought-affected regions gained vote share. In other words, voters at the front-lines of climate change sought out immediate and local economic relief. Unless local politicians can propose climate policies with short-term economic benefits, disasters may limit governments' capacities to pursue long-term climate resilience. © 2021

Abstract: In this article, we reveal the nature and effects of data infrastructures on the authorisation of data that represent students and educational practitioners, including how such data can misrepresent and govern educational policy and practices in sometimes problematic ways. To better understand the governance capacities of data infrastructures, we draw upon notions of discursive practices and materiality, and apply these to a specific school management system, OneSchool, in Queensland, Australia. We show how data infrastructures both promote and impede educational practitioners’ use of data in decision making and daily practices. This includes precluding information about students’ (positive) behaviours and omitting important enrolment information about students’ Indigenous languages. By doing so, we show how data infrastructures govern in ways that authorise the preclusion and omission of data, thereby representing students and schooling. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Abstract: Background: Workplace violence prevalence has attracted significant attention within the international nursing literature. Little attention to non-mental health settings and a lack of evaluation rigor have been identified within review literature. Objectives: To examine the effects of a workplace violence training program in relation to risk assessment and management practices, de-escalation skills, breakaway techniques, and confidence levels, within an acute hospital setting. Design: A quasi-experimental study of nurses using pretest-posttest measurements of educational objectives and confidence levels, with two week follow-up. Setting: A 440 bed metropolitan tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants: Nurses working in specialties identified as a ‘high risk’ for violence. Method: A pre-post-test design was used with participants attending a one day workshop. The workshop evaluation comprised the use of two validated questionnaires: the Continuing Professional Development Reaction questionnaire, and the Confidence in Coping with Patient Aggression Instrument. Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. The paired t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of changes in the clinical behaviour intention and confidence scores from pre- to post-intervention. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated to determine the extent of the significant results. Results: Seventy-eight participants completed both pre- and post-workshop evaluation questionnaires. Statistically significant increases in behaviour intention scores were found in fourteen of the fifteen constructs relating to the three broad workshop objectives, and confidence ratings, with medium to large effect sizes observed in some constructs. A significant increase in overall confidence in coping with patient aggression was also found post-test with large effect size. Conclusions: Positive results were observed from the workplace violence training. Training needs to be complimented by a multi-faceted organisational approach which includes governance, quality and review processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: This study examines the role of resource abundance in the cross-country differences in the impacts of the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008–2009. Using forecasts from the unobserved components model and exponential smoothing technique, we estimate the output levels a country would reach in 2009 and 2013 in the absence of the GFC, and compare these with the realised output levels. We find large variations in the output losses across 72 countries. The mineral-rich countries have been found to be in a strong position to survive any adverse shocks stemming from the GFC. Income per capita, trade openness, and institutional quality and government effectiveness are also found to be key factors determining the differences in output loss in the post-crisis period. These findings have strong implications for resource-rich countries such as Australia and are expected to shed new light on alternative policy designs and appropriate strategies to deal with any future economic crisis. © 2019 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.

Abstract: Using an online panel, we surveyed a representative sample of 500 each in Australia and New Zealand during July 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. We find trust in government has increased dramatically, with around 80% of respondents agreeing government was generally trustworthy. Around three quarters agreed management of the pandemic had increased their trust in government. Over 85% of respondents have confidence that public health scientists work in the public interest. Testing four hypotheses, we find that income and education predict trust in government and confidence in public health scientists, as does voting for the political party in government. Trust in government and confidence in public health scientists strongly predict Covid-19 phone application use, largely through convincing people the App is beneficial. Trust in government then is both an outcome and antecedent of government effectiveness.

Abstract: The escalating environmental crisis and pressing water resource conservation issues globally necessitate comprehensive research. This study investigates urban green space regulations and water resource conservation challenges in Indonesia and Australia. Employing a comparative analysis, it examines the legal frameworks, policies, and implementations in both countries. The research aims to identify innovative and sustainable strategies for water resource protection. Findings reveal substantial disparities in regulatory approaches, public involvement, and the integration of green technologies in green space management between the two nations. Indonesia needs help enhancing institutional capacity and integrating green space policies into urban planning, while Australia focuses on climate change adaptation and sustainable water resource management. The study advocates cross-sectoral collaboration and ecosystem principles in green space regulations for practical water conservation objectives. It contributes fresh perspectives on legal and policy frameworks for addressing water resource conservation challenges through urban green space management, offering recommendations for cohesive and sustainable policy development. © 2024, Lembaga Contrarius Indonesia.

Abstract: Developing and nurturing resilience is critical to the social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) of Indigenous Australian adolescents and their continuing life trajectories. The attendance of many Indigenous adolescents from remote communities at boarding schools creates a need to prioritise and proactively create opportunities that build and nurture student resilience. This requires sustainable and multi-dimensional school-wide approaches. Despite this need, there are no documented SEWB or resilience building approaches for Australian Indigenous students who attend boarding schools. We describe the use of participatory action research to develop and implement a two-year STEP-UP intervention with boarding schools, designed to create supportive environments for improving psychosocial resilience and wellbeing of remote-living Indigenous students. The intervention consisted of three components implemented annually across eight schools: a site-specific STEP-UP action plan; staff capacity development; and an annual Schools and Communities Conference. Thematic analysis of a systematic literature review, documented action planning, conference group processes, resilience theory and survey findings from the associated broader resilience study resulted in the identification of six resilience building domains: valuing culture and identity; developing cultural leadership; nurturing strong relationships; building social and emotional skills; creating safe, supportive environments; and building staff capacity. These domains became the resulting framework for STEP-UP planning and enabled focused examination of practices and future planning. Learnings from the intervention process suggest principles to consider when designing interventions: utilising a strengths-based approach; design responsiveness; collaborative partnerships; institutional capacity; and sustainability. A resilience toolkit website was developed to enable knowledge translation and sustainability beyond the study. © Society for the Provision of Education in Rural Education. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: In recent decades, a number of sustainable strategies and polices have been created to protect and preserve our water environments from the impacts of growing communities. The Australian approach, Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD), defined as the integration of urban planning and design with the urban water cycle management, has made considerable advances on design guidelines since 2000. WSUD stormwater management systems (e.g. wetlands, bioretentions, porous pavement etc), also known as Best Management Practices (BMPs) or Low Impact Development (LID), are slowly gaining popularity across Australia, the USA and Europe. There have also been significant improvements in how to model the performance of the WSUD technologies (e.g. MUSIC software). However, the implementation issues of these WSUD practices are mainly related to ongoing institutional capacity. Some of the key problems are associated with a limited awareness of urban planners and designers; in general, they have very little knowledge of these systems and their benefits to the urban environments. At the same time, hydrological engineers should have a better understanding of building codes and master plans. The land use regulations are equally as important as the physical site conditions for determining opportunities and constraints for implementing WSUD techniques. There is a need for procedures that can make a better linkage between urban planners and WSUD engineering practices. Thus, this paper aims to present the development of a general framework for incorporating WSUD technologies into the site planning process. The study was applied to lot-scale in the Melbourne region, Australia. Results show the potential space available for fitting WSUD elements, according to building requirements and different types of housing densities. © 2011 WIT Press.

Abstract: Although there is widespread consensus in human geography that neoliberalism is achieved through the intersection of multiple scales and states, there has been growing emphasis in recent years on the hybrid qualities of neoliberalist-styles of governance. Because hybrid approaches draw attention to the wide range of actors and contradictory agendas underpinning the always uneven expression of neoliberalist projects, they are particularly suited to the identification of residual state capacities in contexts where neoliberalist forms dominate economic and political life. Drawing on two cases of large-scale residential development in New South Wales, namely Warnervale Town Centre on the New South Wales Central Coast and the Australian Defence Industry site at St Marys in Sydney's west, the present paper adopts an hybrid approach in order to identify current state capacities. Through a comparison of both sites, it identifies the potential for socially and ecologically balanced development in the outer suburban context.

Abstract: Grace Ikombi was eighteen years old in the early 1990s when he fled his dusty village in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), for the capital city of Kinshasa. His father was dead after succumbing to malaria, a disease that can be cured with a $2 treatment. His mother had been murdered by Congolese rebels for providing medical care to loyalists of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Ikombi was exhausted and hungry. "I heard that the rebels at least were eating," he shrugged. "So I joined them."1 In Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 1,500 miles to the northwest of Kinshasa, stories like Ikombi's are familiar. Morifère Bamba, a member of a rebel group operating out of an Abidjan slum, quit school at the age of twelve. His family was mired in poverty. His mother died and his father could no longer provide for him. So Morfère moved to Abidjan. "The city," he said, "would give me the ability to realize my dream." Yet Morfère found his road to employment blocked by violence on the street. He drifted between criminal gangs before landing in a rebel group. The rebellion offered him an identity as well as sustenance. Indeed, French researcher Ruth Marshall-Fratani observes of Côte d'Ivoire: "The gap between aspirations and possibilities has widened incredibly in the last fifteen years."2 Côte d'Ivoire was once one of the most prosperous countries in Africa, relying heavily on agricultural exports to build its economy. To demographers and development experts, it was the "Ivorian Miracle" in a region marked by deep poverty.3 But as commodity prices dropped in the 1980s and 1990s, state coffers were depleted, investors fled, and conditions began to deteriorate. Corruption and mismanagement-such as kickbacks from cocoa producers and extortion by the police-weakened the government's financial base and eroded public trust in government. The infrastructure fragmented. By the late 1990s, only 55 percent of the adult population was literate and 58 percent had no access to potable water.4 Soon, Côte d'Ivoire fell into the same war-ridden cycle of impoverishment and conflict that has enmeshed the DRC. In the fall of 2002, war between rebel insurgents from the poorer northern region and government loyalists in the more prosperous south erupted in Côte d'Ivoire, fueled in part by cultural and political factors. As the state descended into civil war, it was ill-equipped to extinguish an insurgency fed by a volatile cocktail of soaring unemployment rates and a sharp economic downturn.5 Across the developing world, poverty undermines state capacity to create jobs, educate people, and provide basic health services. Today, civil conflict is by far the most common form of armed warfare, and its occurrence is overwhelmingly concentrated in poor countries that lack the capacity to govern.6 In 2005, 90 percent of armed conflicts occurred in low- and lower-middle-income countries.7 From Sierra Leone and Angola to Tajikistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, civil wars erupt disproportionately in countries and regions facing endemic poverty, sharp economic decline, or both. Overall, civil wars in the developing world have claimed more than 16 million lives in seventy-three countries and displaced 67 million people since 1945.8 Scholarship on the causes of civil war reveals a complexity of interacting factors, but the bottom line has become increasingly clear: countries with low income per capita face a substantially higher risk of civil war.9 Less clear are the specific circumstances under which poverty increases the risk of war, as the mechanisms vary from country to country. Still, one central trend is that poverty decreases state capacity, weak states create more opportunities for rebellion, and civil wars then lock poor countries into a spiral that further entrenches poverty. Because poverty undermines state capacity, it creates conditions that insurgents can exploit to launch, perpetuate, and restart rebellion. Poverty and state weakness contribute to each phase of conflict: the initial spark before conflict erupts, recruitment during an insurgency, sustained violence during a full-blown civil war, and recurrence after civil war has ended. Economists invoke this "conflict trap" to explain the puzzle of what Oxford University's Paul Collier calls the "bottom billion": the 1 billion people mired in poverty in developing countries that, in contrast to the rest of the world, have failed to grow in recent decades.10 The conflict trap also explains why, absent developed country interventions, poor and conflict-ridden countries are unlikely to improve their predicament on their own. Civil war disrupts economic activity, diverts resources from public services, can create massive flows of refugees, increases crime and homicide rates, and promotes the spread of diseases that kill millions of people every year, long after the fighting has stopped.11 Humanitarian concerns are not the only reason that Americans should care about the implications of war in distant countries. Wars in those places now have far-reaching implications for U.S., regional, and even global security. Most recent mass atrocities have occurred in countries engulfed in civil war. Furthermore, mounting scholarship confirms that civil war in one country strongly increases the likelihood of violence breaking out in neighboring states.12 In Central Africa in the mid-1990s, the conflict between Hutus and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi helped to ignite a massive civil war in Zaire. Vital U.S. security interests are at stake in several other parts of the developing world where violence has spilled across borders and affected entire regions. In the Horn of Africa, for instance, conflict in Somalia continues unabated despite the presence of African Union peacekeeping forces. Somalia's anarchy has prompted neighboring Ethiopia to intervene militarily and continues to provide international terrorists and pirates with a base of operations. Global security, including that of Americans, is also compromised when conflict zones incubate transnational threats. Conflict zones in countries from Afghanistan to the Philippines, Sierra Leone, and Somalia have proved to be ideal operating environments for transnational terrorist networks. Al Qaeda gained a foothold in Afghanistan in the 1990s during the brutal civil war that followed the withdrawal of the Soviet Union. Most global drug production takes place in conflict or postconflict countries.13 The routes traffickers follow from the country of origin to American, Australian, and European markets also go through conflict and postconflict countries. Diseases also spread more quickly in conflict zones, ultimately threatening people in distant countries. States in conflict or bordering on conflict zones in the 1990s had much higher HIV/AIDS rates than peaceful countries.14 All of these factors convey a strong message to U.S. policymakers: that it is imperative for them to assign far greater priority to breaking the cycle of poverty, state weakness, and violence in developing countries. © 2010 The Brookings Institution.

Abstract: Transitioning to more sustainable urban water management is widely accepted as an essential societal objective. While there has been significant progress in developing technical solutions to the challenges faced, numerous barriers remain at the regime level, indicating that further investigation into the regime is required. This paper reports on a social research project aimed at identifying capacity attributes of a more sustainable urban water management regime. Attributes were identified for the administrative and regulatory framework, inter- and intraorganisational and individual regime spheres. Over 125 urban water practitioners specialising in sustainability in Sydney and Melbourne were interviewed to identify the attributes of a more sustainable regime. The attributes reveal that a sustainable urban water management regime emphasises learning, diverse policy tools and institutional arrangements, together with interaction among stakeholders and professional disciplines. The interaction is characterised by respect, trust and mutual understanding. The sustainable regime attributes are compared to the traditional regime and reveal that while progress has been made towards a sustainable regime, additional improvement is required. Attributes identified across multiple regime spheres indicate potential focus areas for capacity building programs or reform efforts to more effectively enable regime change towards sustainable urban water management. © IWA Publishing 2010.

Abstract: In order to deepen understanding of path dependence in urban transport, this article presents a case study of urban passenger transport institutions in Melbourne, Australia over 50 years. The institutional capacity of the roads and public transport sectors are explored separately and the trends are then compared and contrasted. The main components of the analysis are: structural changes to the organisations, participation on planning committees, access to financial resources, accountability frameworks, membership of forums and relationships with other actors. The conclusion is that, whilst the historical picture is complex, the trend is a strengthening of road planning institutions, and weakening public transport planning. This situation appears to be out of alignment with current needs. © 2009.

Abstract: The Murray-Darling Basin contains Australia's most important surface water resource. Ecological damage and threatened water security have led to a cap on further diversions, presently amounting to ̃45% of the total water resource. An increase in environmental flows representing 2% of the total resource is now sought to restore river health. At the same time, there are threats which may reduce water resources by 10-20% in 2020, including climate trends, afforestation, bush fire vegetation recovery, induced losses to groundwater, and reduced irrigation return flows further downstream. We outline the relative magnitude and characteristics of each threat, and highlight the need for improved observation networks, system-wide water accounting integrated modelling, and institutional capacity to support future water management.

Exchange rate volatility appears to be an impediment for cross-border bond investment. Investors prefer investing in countries with stronger quality of institutions including bureaucratic quality, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, efficiency of judicial system, risk of contract repudiation, and rating of accounting standards. © World Scientific Publishing Co.

Abstract: Purpose: Institutional governance theory is used to explain voluntary corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting in the context of a market governance system in the absence of climate change public policy. This paper seeks to hypothesise that GHG reporting is related to internal organisation systems, external privately promulgated guidance and EU ETS trading. Design/methodology/approach: A two-stage approach is used. The initial model examines whether firms' GHG disclosures are associated with internal organisation systems factors: environmental management systems (EMS), corporate governance quality and environmental management committees as well as external private guidance provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 187 ASX 300 firms. EU ETS trading is also included. Determinants of the extent and credibility of GHG disclosure is examined in the second stage where an index constructed from the GHG reporting standard "ISO 14064-1" items for a sub-sample of 80 disclosing firms as the dependent variable. Findings: Firms that voluntarily disclose GHGs have EMSs (uncertified and certified), higher corporate governance quality and publicly report to the CDP, tend to be large and in the energy and mining and industrial sectors. The credibility and extent of disclosures are related to the existence of a certified EMS, public reporting to the CDP, and use of the GRI. Firms that disclose more credible information are more likely to be large and in the energy and mining, industrial and services sectors. Originality/value: The paper shows that some proactive but pragmatic Australian firms are disclosing their GHGs voluntarily for competitive advantage in the current market governance system in the absence of public policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to severely impact the natural and human environment. The urban environment is particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change because of a range of geographic and social factors. This chapter aims to investigate the institutional capacity of the private urban development sector in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia to respond to the task of climate change adaptation and, in turn, investigate the role of private financial institutions in funding climate adaptive urban development. The project methodology included a desktop literature review, an online questionnaire survey and a series of semi-structured interviews and focus groups held with members of the SEQ development sector that included developers, consultants, state and local government staff, architects, solicitors, planners and financiers. Larger developers tended to have more capacity to include climate adaptive features in their developments. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In October 2006, state premiers and territory chief ministers gathered in Melbourne for the first meeting of the Council for the Australian Federation (CAF). This little-heralded event marked the beginning of the first formalised structure for state and territory only collaboration since Federation. This article describes the genesis and creation of this new structural response to ongoing state concerns about the trend to an increasingly centralised pattern of Commonwealth-state relations. It identifies the intended functions of the Council, which include: acting as a mechanism for coordinating approaches to negotiations with the Commonwealth; operating as a clearing house for policy ideas in Australia and internationally; harmonising regulatory frameworks; and developing improvements to service delivery in areas of state responsibility. Informed by interviews with key players involved with its establishment and documentary sources, this article assesses CAF's performance during its first 18 months of operation. It explores the hopes and aspirations of key CAF stakeholders, and some of the issues that have confronted the fledgling organisation. Personnel changes among the cohort of state and territory leaders, and the election of a federal Labor government in November 2007 have altered the dynamics of CAF. The article argues that CAF's emergence is an attempt by sub-national governments to develop new capacity and leverage to address the asymmetries that characterise contemporary Australian federalism. However, there are questions about CAF's future, particularly about state and territory governments' capacity to pursue collaborative agendas given the pace and scope of Kevin Rudd's 'new federalism' reforms and the demands it is placing on their policy and administrative systems. © 2008 National Council of the Institute of Public Administration Australia.

Abstract: For Tasmanians accessing Government services has traditionally required visits to various Lead Agency locations, as service delivery was fragmented and bureaucratic. The Tasmanian Government adopted a customer-focused approach implementing 'Service Tasmania' a One-Stop-Shop service delivery concept. This paper investigates what led to the success of this public service reform and in particular what change management practices were applied during the change effort. Ten common factors of successful change have been identified in the literature; these are explored determining their relevance throughout this initiative. Data were collected with semi-structured interviews conducted with 63 staff plus senior management. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach and open coding was applied during the first pass through the data to reach the initial codes identifying critical terms and generic key issues. Findings confirm that several management interventions were necessary to address resistance and conflict issues and keep the government reform project on track. © 2014 National Council of the Institute of Public Administration Australia.

Abstract: As transnational programs are often advocated as a knowledge transfer opportunity between the partner universities, this case study investigated the knowledge transfer (KT) processes between Indonesian and Australian universities through an undergraduate transnational program partnership (TPP). An inter-organisational KT theoretical framework from the business sector was adapted and used to guide the study. The data were generated through semi-structured interviews with key university officers and document analysis from two partner universities. Based on the thematic analysis of the data, the findings demonstrated that the curriculum mapping process facilitated KT. However, different intentions of the partner universities in establishing the program led to declining interest to conduct more KT when expectations were not met. The Indonesian university’s existing knowledge, acquired from other sources through processes that were serendipitous and based on individual lecturers’ personal experience, meant that KT opportunities through the TPP were not always pursued despite written agreement to exchange knowledge with the Australian partner. While KT most evidently resulted in institutional capacity development for the Indonesian university’s school that managed the TPP, dissemination of knowledge to other units within the university was more challenging due to communication problems between the units. Hence, other universities seeking to conduct KT through TPPs need to understand each partner university’s intention in establishing the partnerships, identify the institutions’ needs before seeking knowledge input from the partner university and improve the communication between and within the universities for sustainable benefits. © 2015, Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

Abstract: The history of river management in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin demonstrates the effective limits of political and financial power in a federal system. While the financial power rests overwhelmingly with the federal government, state governments with greater knowledge and administrative capacity have pursued their own different goals. Backed by a funding package of over $12 billion Australian over ten years the federal government is currently implementing a comprehensive Basin Plan. This involves not only a shift in responsibility for high level policy to the national government but also an attempt to make river management sustainable from a basin-wide perspective The Council of Australian Governments has unanimously agreed that reform is needed but the proposed policy and institutional changes introduced by the federal government are being widely resisted by state governments . This chapter places the current debate within its historical context and discusses a new set of institutional arrangements that are emerging unplanned and unintended but which could prove quite robust and moderately effective. © Oxford University Press, 2015.

Abstract: This paper traces key policy challenges facing Australia's metropolitan cities as a result of multi-scaled shifts in their governance contexts. These shifts, related both to the neoliberal erosion of a national commitment to universal social provision and to the adoption of a 'competitive city' governance paradigm at the urban scale, have produced a set of governance challenges, especially concerning urban social inclusion and cohesion. Moreover, a range of institutional obstacles continues to hinder the generation of urban governance capacity to address these challenges. The paper works through the nature of these obstacles and takes a pragmatic approach to identifying existing and fledgling opportunities to mobilize and re-energize the capacity to govern in Australia's big cities. In particular it points to the need for a national urban governance agenda addressing a stifling institutional fragmentation, the need to move beyond the limits of the 'competitive city' governance paradigm to mobilize the resilient capacities of State intervention, and the need to harness private resources and capacities more effectively to public policy rather than market-driven aspirations. In working through these needs, the paper also considers the potential of recent initiatives of the newly elected Rudd Federal government, which recognize and provide policy responses in each of these domains, to boost existing opportunities and to enhance substantially capacities for the governance of Australia's major cities.

Abstract: The international spread of antitrust suggested the historical process shaping global capitalism. By the 1930s, Americans feared that big business exceeded the government's capacity to impose accountability, engendering the most aggressive antitrust campaign in history. Meanwhile, big business had emerged to varying degrees in liberal Britain, Australia and France, Nazi Germany, and militarist Japan. These same nations nonetheless expressly rejected American-style antitrust as unsuited to their cultures and institutions. After World War II, however, governments in these nations – as well as the European Community – adopted workable antitrust regimes. By the millennium antitrust was instrumental to the clash between state sovereignty and globalization. What ideological and institutional factors explain the global change from opposing to supporting antitrust? Addressing this question, this book throws new light on the struggle over liberal capitalism during the Great Depression and World War II, the postwar Allied occupations of Japan and Germany, the reaction against American big-business hegemony during the Cold War, and the clash over globalization and the WTO. © Tony A.

Abstract: Payroll-tax thresholds make firms smaller than they would otherwise be and concentrate firms at just below threshold employment. We estimate the resulting dead-weight losses under perfect and monopolistic competition. Under monopolistic competition, the threshold-induced dead-weight loss in Victoria is approximately 10 per cent of payroll-tax collections over a wide range of threshold levels. Because payroll-tax design affects the size distribution of firms, it also affects the Commonwealth Grants Commission's assessment of a State's capacity to generate payroll taxes. This violates a principle of the Commonwealth Grants Commission that its grant to a State be independent of the State's policies. © 2004. The Economic Society of Australia.

Abstract: Several recent works have emphasised new relations of hierarchy within international society, primarily involving the claim by certain Western states of the authority to intervene in particular territories in order to build state capacity and the institutions of sound liberal democratic governance. While several scholars have identified these new hierarchies, few have provided a satisfactory account of what informs their formation and reproduction. This article investigates why new hierarchies have emerged within international society, arguing that they are underpinned by a 'liberal social logic of risk', which simultaneously constructs liberal democracies as inherently peaceful and prosperous and non-liberal or weak states as inherently risky and dangerous. Confronted by new forms of debounded security risks, Western societies have sought to manage these risks via interventions in identified 'risky zones' aimed at building liberal political and economic institutions. This argument is illustrated by the example of Australia's new interventionist development agenda in the Asia-Pacific, notably its leading role in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). This interventionist agenda is, in effect, a new mechanism of regional risk management that informs new modes of hierarchical governance in the Asia-Pacific. © 2009 Australian Institute of International Affairs.

Abstract: In light of the best practice recommendations released by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in March 2003, this study tests the relationship between initial public offering (IPO) firm performance and board governance quality, captured by board size, board leadership, board composition, and director"s share ownership. Based on a sample of Australian IPO firms that lodged prospectuses with ASX between 1994 and 1999, we do not find evidence that links underpricing to board structures at the time of IPO. IPO firms' board structures are insignificant in explaining the level of IPO underpricing, and board size is the only board governance variable significant in explaining long-run aftermarket performance, after controlling for the size of the firm. That is, IPO firms with larger boards at the time of issuance perform better in the long-run, consistent with the resource dependence theory. Thus, we conclude that ASX"s best practice recommendations are likely to distort the market-driven practices already in place, and our findings lead us to question the role played by the board of directors in signalling firm quality.

Abstract: We investigate whether and if so, how, corporate governance 'quality'fn2 1 is related to the information flows from a company and how the share market and its agents respond. Specifically, we study links between the 'quality' of a firm's corporate governance (CGQ) and the informativeness of its disclosures. We employ six indicators of informativeness. They include document counts, properties of analysts' forecasts and a 'timeliness' metric, in the spirit of b4Ball and Brown (1968), that reflects the average speed of price discovery throughout the year. Our results suggest the answer to our question is 'Yes': better-governed firms do make more informative disclosures. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Abstract: We compare Australian and New Zealand parliamentary demands on executive governments to 'do something' about globalisation, noting that parliaments are distinctive institutionally - functioning as umbrellas protecting arenas of adversarial competitiveness, with little scope for cohesive institutional capacity. We define 'globalisation' as it is defined by the parliamentary actors themselves: that is, quite broadly with different actors taking different postures towards globalisation depending on party and on political and institutional perspectives. Whether parliaments can respond effectively to globalisation depends on their institutional capacity and political composition - their political resources. We establish the international context in which the two parliaments operate, establishing our hypotheses about institutional capacity from Lisa Martin's book Democratic Commitments: Legislatures and International Cooperation . We conclude that both parliaments have made significant, if often unnoticed, contributions to the political management of globalisation.

Abstract: Commercial success in universities in the USA and Canada has resulted in many other countries taking steps to emulate this performance and major technology transfer and commercialisation support programmes have been launched in UK, Europe, Australia, Japan and many other countries - including South Africa. Unrealistic expectations have, however, been generated by the spectacular successes of a relatively few institutions and it is not always realised that the success from commercialisation is proportional to the magnitude of the investment in research. Without a well funded, high quality research system, it is not possible for technology transfer to make any significant contribution to economic development. The possible economic returns to higher education institutions from commercialisation of research can be estimated using international benchmarks. This forecast uses a combination of an institutional return on investment model and a simple economic projection. The model is generic and can be adapted for use in any institution. As more data becomes available from local (and international) sources, the model will be refined to give better estimates. The model is dynamic and shows, quantitatively, why it can take up to 10 years for an institution, and 20 years nationally, to attain a positive rate of return from an investment in research and technology transfer. The model enables the long-term impact of policy decisions, in an institution and nationally, to be examined and alternative scenarios explored. The performance of individual institutions is, however, highly variable and unpredictable. This is even for those institutions that are comparable in size and maturity. A large portfolio of patents and licences is required to give a reasonable probability of positive returns. This may be possible at a national level, but is problematic in smaller institutions - and smaller countries. Because the benefits of the innovation system are captured largely at national level, with institutions having a high uncertainty, public sector support to reduce the institutional risk is necessary to assist institutions to make the necessary investments. Technology transfer is of course only one element of the overall research and innovation value chain. All elements must be functioning effectively to derive the economic and social benefits from research. In addition to a strong research system, adequate incentives must exist to encourage academics to participate, particularly with regard to the crucial initial step of invention disclosure. After disclosure, sufficient institutional capacity must be in place to take an idea, evaluate it, protect the intellectual property appropriately and then seek a path to commercialisation through either licensing or start-up company formation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to identify the basis of regional competence in industry sectors that are not key performers at the national level. The paper examines the ICT sector in two regions: Dresden (Germany) and Adelaide (Australia). The performance of Australia and Germany in ICT is not high by OECD standards. However, both Dresden and Adelaide have some competence in parts of the ICT sector that departs from national patterns. In Dresden the development of the ICT sector is more advanced than in Adelaide. In both regions, there are distinctive institutional features and policies that explain the development of the ICT sector. Further, in Dresden, the state has coordinated the ICT sector within the regional space, giving focus to institutional strengths in research and training, such that it is possible to describe the institutional environment as 'thick and coherent'. As such, the regional space of Dresden has experienced an agglomeration of ICT and can be regarded as more successful than Adelaide, where institutions and state initiatives are fragmented and incoherent.

Abstract: Purpose – The purpose of this study is to develop a governance typology which identifies governance issues and outcomes. Multi-owned properties (MOPs) are a unique property type due to the incorporation of a private governance association. Although there are jurisdictional differences, these associations are generally responsible for the management, maintenance and control of the commonly owned property; determining the contributions payable by each lot owner to the operation of the association; enforcing the rules of the association; and ensuring that records meet legislative requirements. Legislation for MOP schemes was enacted in different jurisdictions to guide the governance and management of these matters. However, challenges relating to the governance of MOPs have continued to be a problem as identified in the literature and practice. Design/methodology/approach – The study first reviewed the legislation in three Australian states to identify specific governance categories and the legislative requirements related to those categories. To gain group opinion about the specific governance issues and outcomes, the Delphi method was utilised whereby industry experts participated in a two-round survey questionnaire. Findings – A typology was developed as a result of consensus found between participants. The findings identified key governance issues and outcomes for MOPs. Practical implications – The governance typology forms the basis for the development of a more comprehensive audit tool for the assessment of governance quality in individual schemes. Originality/value – This paper is the first of its kind to collate issues impacting upon effective owners’ corporation governance and the potential outcomes associated with poor governance practices in MOPs. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: Assessment of the quality of governance has so far relied on socioeconomic statistics and expert opinions, while largely neglecting citizens perceptions. Using AsiaBarometer 2008 data, this paper examines the factors affecting citizens satisfaction with their government in six Asian-Pacific countries: America, Australia, China, India, Japan, and Russia. I found citizen satisfaction with the public services they receive, such as education, healthcare, and public safety, matters most in their assessment of government performance. Individual satisfaction with income, job, and housing also matters. The respondent will disapprove government performance if he or she thinks corruption is serious in government, or elected officials stop caring about citizens once voting is finished. In terms of macro variables, economic condition of a country seems to matters significantly. Especially, if a country's economy is growing fast, citizens are much more likely to be satisfied with government performance. Large within-country variations exist in countries such as China and India, where citizens of different cities or regions may give rather different assessments of government, suggesting many contextual variables not captured by this study. Lastly, citizens satisfaction with government performance seems to be highly divergent from international organizations evaluation of governance quality, such as the World Bank Governance Index. This raises both methodological and normative issues regarding the proper approaches to measuring good governance. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2010.

Abstract: The sustainable urban water management system is likely to be characterised by complex and flexible governance arrangements, increased inter-organisational interaction and wide stakeholder participation, which contrasts significantly with the traditional approach. Recently there has been significant financial investment in urban water reform, however the reforms have not been as successful as anticipated and numerous institutional barriers remain. Understanding and assessing institutional capacity is central to addressing institutional impediments. Institutional capacity comprises individual, intra- and inter-organisational and external rules and incentives capacities. This paper reports on the first case study of a social research project that aims to develop an institutional capacity assessment framework. Empirical data from semi-structured interviews with 59 water industry experts in Sydney, Australia, and a broad literature survey were used. The key capacity attributes identified could form the basis of an institutional capacity assessment tool and reveal common and differing attributes across stakeholder groups which provide insight into stakeholder relations. Synthesis of the results revealed that intra- and inter-organisational capacities were facing particular challenges and should be explicitly addressed in reform, policy and capacity development initiatives. © IWA Publishing 2009.

Abstract: This paper argues that neoliberalism should be viewed not as a unified coherent project but as a series of complex and overlapping strategies that produce hybrid and always emergent forms of governance. To substantiate this argument, the paper reflects on the recent history of Sydney's metropolitan planning and rejects any simple characterisation of its having been transformed from a social-democratic to a neoliberal form of governance. Instead it traces the unevenness with which neoliberalist aspirations and forms of governance have been enacted through metropolitan planning. In particular, it examines the enduring scope of state institutional capacity to pursue desired spatial and distributional outcomes through planning and suggests that the current reinvigoration of Sydney's metropolitan planning is an opportunity to enhance that capacity and to pursue 'after-neoliberalist' planning possibilities. © Institute of Australian Geographers 2005.

Abstract: State interventions to govern social vulnerability highlight the complexity of contemporary states, marked by neoliberal agenda but also by progressive interventions and the desire for effectiveness. This paper draws on collaborative research with government agencies on social vulnerability in the Hunter region to assess the desirability of undertaking critical geographies with the state. We see states as contested terrains invested with the institutional capacity to mobilise diverse political projects. We argue that critical research in partnership with states is possible, as are mobilisations of the agency of state institutions to promote progressive policy development. The paper explores how we might use engaged research to intersect with the production and circulation of texts, technologies and practices within the state apparatus to achieve desirable change. While critical research with the state involves uncertainties and compromise, with no permanent resolutions, we conclude that states must remain centred in our critical conversations and praxis. In this paper we advance the case for the critical possibilities of policy-oriented research with the state. We reflect on experiences of an engaged research project with state government agencies in the NSW Hunter Region involving the production and use of the texts and technologies as state interventions in social vulnerability. Working through the project's reflexive, collaborative methodologies and our use of critical GIS, we highlight the creation of opportunities to change how the components of social vulnerability were conceptualised, contest policymakers' view of what was "relevant", and shift framing rationalities and resultant state practices. As such the paper contributes to our knowledge of strategic research practices for pursuing critical, progressive projects with the state. Such engagement involves uncertainties and contingent compromise. Yet, as terrains of contestation wherein diverse political projects are assembled and propelled, states must remain centred in our critical conversations and in our critical praxis. © 2012 The Author.

Abstract: This chapter serves to clarify some of the key concepts with respect to the political independence of the police. By graphically illustrating the relationship between degrees of 'control' and degrees of accountability it is argued that the two concepts are not incompatible. The term 'independence' is used in the chapter to refer only to decision making that falls in what is pictured as the fourth quadrant: 'full accountability' with 'no control.' The chapter then outlines the scope or range of the potentially independent decision-making tasks. Relationships between the police and governments have proven to be a source of persistent difficulty and controversy in many countries of the world. In this chapter the experiences of and debates over this relationship in Britain, Australia, and New Zealand during the last three decades are reviewed and discussed. The analysis discloses that, despite similar legal and constitutional traditions, the relationships between the police and governments have played out quite differently in the three jurisdictions. There is, however, a common trend towards greater and more detailed political accountability of the police in all three countries. Somewhat ironically, in Britain, the birthplace of the now common notion of 'police independence,' recent developments have most threatened this doctrine of police autonomy from political influence and direction. In all three countries, however, the impact of more generalized public service reforms (the so-called new public management) has made more inroads into the practical political independence of the police than any explicit retreat from established legal doctrine on this subject. A growing disparity between the practices of governments and the conservatism of judicial pronouncements on police independence is apparent in all three jurisdictions. This is most clearly manifest in movements towards legislative specification of the parameters of the police-government relationship, in preference to reliance on judicial rulings on the subject. In all three countries, however, governments have been reluctant to concede to police any right to complete immunity from political influence or direction with respect to the handling of major public order challenges, such as political demonstrations. © University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2007.

Abstract: Indigenous Australians have a growing capacity to extract monetary payments from mineral development on their traditional lands. Considerable controversy surrounds the possible use of these payments to fund services such as health, housing and education for the Indigenous groups concerned. Critics of such an approach argue that government should provide basic public services to all citizens, and that use of 'mining payments' for service provision denies Indigenous people specific compensation for the negative impacts of mining and an important opportunity to enhance their economic status. There is also a danger that government may reduce its existing spending on services, leaving Indigenous people no better off as a result of allowing mining to occur. This article argues that while there are certainly risks involved in using mining payments to fund services, Indigenous groups can generate substantial net benefits by doing so. Mining payments can leverage additional government spending; fund services at a level or of a sort that government will not provide; give Indigenous people greater control over service provision; and help develop Indigenous organisational skills and governance capacity. A strategic approach is required to minimise risk and maximise the available benefits, and the article identifies policy principles that can be applied to secure such an outcome.

Abstract: The permissive conditions for business-related human rights abuses today are created by a misalignment between economic forces and governance capacity. Only realignment can fix the problem. In its operations in the Indonesian province of Papua, the U.S. mining company Freeport-McMoRan has been accused of assisting in serious human rights abuses, including torture committed by military and private security forces in Freeport facilities and on Freeport property. In the Sudan, a number of corporations, including the Canadian company Talisman Energy and the Swedish company Lundin Oil AB, have been the targets of campaigns claiming that the companies willfully ignored, or positively assisted in, forcible depopulations occurring in and around their oil mining concession regions. The U.S. company Unocal Corporation settled out of court a lawsuit alleging that it had knowingly used forced labor in its extractive operations in Myanmar. More recently, the Australian company Anvil Mining came under investigation for providing the vehicles that facilitated a military operation by state forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an operation that allegedly involved the commission of a number of war crimes, including rape, arbitrary detentions, and summary executions. In the context of contemporary global economies, allegations of corporate involvement in breaches of international human rights standards are unfortunately not uncommon. In some cases the nature and extent of wrongful conduct in which corporations are being implicated might be classified as international crimes. International crimes include slavery, crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and torture. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

Abstract: The state of governance in Bangladesh has a chequered history. The country's battle for independence, and its history of military dictatorships and dysfunctional democracy, have brought challenges in terms of establishing a sound system of governance. The five pillars of public governance have posed formidable obstacles to establishing and reforming key institutions, refining processes and strategies of management and guiding the country towards a more efficient and effective system. Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative accountability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, administrative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains. We argue that state institutions have been captured by members of a powerful nexus who have developed a symbiotic relationship with the state, affecting its institutional capacity to reduce corruption, strengthen transparency and accountability, and allow the judiciary and public bureaucracy to work professionally. © 2012 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.

Abstract: Australia has one of the lowest population densities in the developed world (ABS 2012) and a long and sparsely populated coastline. Institutional capacity for adaptation at the local government scale is vital in Australia, because it is at this scale that many discussions around adaptation occur and decisions are made. In parallel to the institutional analysis, an economic model is created to calculate the distribution of the expected costs of storm surge inundation and the potential benefits of adaptation in terms of avoided costs. The chapter considers the three most discussed economically model-able adaptation options within the 'protect' (seawall), 'accommodate' (changed minimum floor heights) and 'retreat' (retreat) categories. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract: Since September 2001, the United States has increased focus on radical Islamist and terrorist groups in Southeast Asia, particularly those in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. Southeast Asia has been a base for terrorist operations. Al Qaeda penetrated the region by establishing local cells, training Southeast Asians in its camps in Afghanistan, and by financing and cooperating with indigenous radical Islamist groups. Indonesia and the southern Philippines have been particularly vulnerable to penetration by Islamic terrorist groups. Members of one indigenous network, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which has had extensive ties to Al Qaeda, helped two of the September 11, 2001 hijackers and have confessed to plotting and carrying out attacks against Western targets. These include the deadliest terrorist attack since September 2001: the October 2002 bombing in Bali, Indonesia, that killed approximately 200 people, mostly Westerners. Since the Bali bombing in 2002, crackdowns by various governments in the region-encouraged and in some cases supported by the U.S. government and military- are believed to have weakened JI to such an extent that it essentially is no longer a regional organization, but rather is one confined to Indonesia, with some individuals still operating in the southern Philippines. The degrading of JI's leadership structure is believed to have altered the group's strategy. More violent, anti-Western JI members have formed breakaway cells. In September 2009, Indonesian authorities claimed they had killed the leader of one such cell, Noordin Mohammed Top. Noordin is believed to have been responsible for organizing the near- simultaneous July 17, 2009 bombings of the J.W. Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta. The bombings were the first successful anti-Western terrorist attack in Indonesia in four years. Their sophistication triggered speculation that Al Qaeda had renewed ties with Top. To combat the threat, the U.S. has pressed countries in the region to arrest suspected terrorist individuals and organizations, funded and trained Indonesia's elite counter-terroristunit, and deployed troops to the southern Philippines to advise the Philippine military in their fight against the violent Abu Sayyaf Group. It has also launched a Regional Maritime Security Initiative to enhance security in the Straits of Malacca, increased intelligence sharing operations, restarted military-military relations with Indonesia, and provided or requested from Congress substantial aid for Indonesia and the Philippines. Also, since 2001, Thailand and the United States have substantially increased their anti-terrorism cooperation. The responses of countries in the region to both the threat and to the U.S. reaction generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics. In general, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the United States and Australia, whereas Indonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to its citizens. Since that time, Indonesian authorities have been aggressive in their pursuit of terrorists and extremist groups. Many governments view increased American pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the political sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream Islamic and secular nationalist groups. The Muslim insurgency in southern Thailand has escalated in recent years as has terrorist activity in southern areas of the Philippines. The report looks at the rise of Islamist militancy and the JI network, and discusses terrorism in the region, concluding with options for U.S. policy. Strategies include placing greater emphasis on attacking institutions that support terrorism, building up regional governments' capacities for combating terrorist groups, and reducing the sense of alienation among Muslim citizens. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Abstract: The integration of urban water cycle management with urban planning and design is referred to as 'Water Sensitive Urban Design' or 'WSUD' in Australia; one of the key elements of WSUD is the management of urban stormwater. In early 2006, the Victorian Government released the Yarra River Action Plan, which allocated $20 million towards tackling urban stormwater pollution. To help ensure this money is allocated in an equitable and transparent manner across all metropolitan local governments a multi-criteria assessment tool has been developed. This paper presents an overview of the multi-criteria assessment tool developed and adopted for selecting WSUD projects that are eligible for funding through Melbourne Water's Stormwater Program. This tool considers three types of indicators: environmental, engagement (engagement with stakeholders and local government capacity building) and financial. Within each category, a series of indicators of different weightings are applied to score a project. Where initial concept designs do not meet the Program criteria, additional work is undertaken to refine and improve the project. The tool and its use are illustrated with a case study. © IWA Publishing 2010.

Abstract: In urban and suburban areas, stormwater runoff is a primary stressor on surface waters. Conventional urban stormwater drainage systems often route runoff directly to streams and rivers, thus exacerbating pollutant inputs and hydrologic disturbance, and resulting in the degradation of ecosystem structure and function. Decentralized stormwater management tools, such as low impact development (LID) or water sensitive urban design (WSUD), may offer a more sustainable solution to stormwater management if implemented at a watershed scale. These tools are designed to pond, infiltrate, and harvest water at the source, encouraging evaporation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and re-use of stormwater. While there are numerous demonstrations of WSUD practices, there are few examples of widespread implementation at a watershed scale with the explicit objective of protecting or restoring a receiving stream. This article identifies seven major impediments to sustainable urban stormwater management: (1) uncertainties in performance and cost, (2) insufficient engineering standards and guidelines, (3) fragmented responsibilities, (4) lack of institutional capacity, (5) lack of legislative mandate, (6) lack of funding and effective market incentives, and (7) resistance to change. By comparing experiences from Australia and the United States, two developed countries with existing conventional stormwater infrastructure and escalating stream ecosystem degradation, we highlight challenges facing sustainable urban stormwater management and offer several examples of successful, regional WSUD implementation. We conclude by identifying solutions to each of the seven impediments that, when employed separately or in combination, should encourage widespread implementation of WSUD with watershed-based goals to protect human health and safety, and stream ecosystems. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract: The worldwide spread of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis (TB) bacteria is out of control and incidents of harder-to-cure TB illness are rising. This article explores the present and potential impact of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB)-a deadly, contagious and virtually incurable disease-on human health and state capacity. Detected cases of XDR-TB can occasion the implementation of extraordinary control measures, because some governments are sufficiently fearful of the disease as to frame it as an issue of national security. Such framing has the potential to precipitate more financial resources and stronger legal powers to bolster public health, but it might also increase the risk that emergency response measures will be counterproductive and/or unjust. Framing XDR-TB as a security issue is empirically plausible, and doing so is a good thing provided that increased response efforts promote rather than hinder the provision of universal access to adequate TB treatment over the long term. Two disease control measures that are motivated particularly by security concerns are border control and patient isolation. This article offers an assessment of each measure by reference to public health ethics in order to differentiate good and bad securitisation.*This article is part of a project on infectious diseases, security and ethics sponsored by the Australian Research Council.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Capacity and its fallacies: International state building as state transformation

Abstract: Considerable effort in recent years has gone into rebuilding fragile states. However, the debates over the effectiveness of such state-building exercises have tended to neglect that capacity building and the associated good governance programmes which comprise contemporary state building are essentially about transforming the state - meaning the ways in which political power is produced and reproduced. State capacity is now often presented as the missing link required for generating positive development outcomes and security. However, rather than being an objective and technical measure, capacity building constitutes a political and ideological mechanism for operationalising projects of state transnationalisation. The need to question prevailing notions of state capacity has become apparent in light of the failure of many state-building programmes. Such programmes have proven difficult to implement, and implementation has rarely achieved the expected development turnarounds or alleviation of violent conflict in those countries. In this article it is argued that, to identify the potential trajectories of such interventions, we must understand the role state building currently plays in domestic politics, and in particular, the ways in which processes of state transformation affect the development of different and often conflicting power bases within the state. This argument is examined using examples from the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. © The Author(s), 2009.

Abstract: The last decade has seen increasing attention to institutional arrangements and policy outcomes affecting the governance of the world's seas and oceans. Governance is linked to institutional capacity and to the effectiveness of public organizations drawing attention to tools and approaches underpinning effective and efficient institutional arrangements. Australia has taken a high profile in oceans governance, with international actions matched by the development of a number of national initiatives including a national Oceans Policy. Australia has numerous laws and policy instruments addressing aspects of the management of the marine environment, reflecting the federal nature of this policy area where responsibility is shared between the Commonwealth (federal or Australian) government and Australian state and territory governments. The Oceans Policy, implemented by the Commonwealth and applied within Commonwealth jurisdiction, has been a major initiative but its implementation highlights a number of challenges. This article outlines Australia's approach to ocean governance and assesses, through reference to the concept of effectiveness, current governance arrangements integral to the Oceans Policy.

Abstract: Ecological modernisation (EM), in theory and practice, has increasingly become central to contemporary state environmental reform agendas. EM's allure lies in its central tenet that the contemporary institutions of capitalism can be ecologically adapted to achieve ‘win–win’ economic and environmental outcomes. How government policy can best accomplish this aim is contested, however, with weak and strong EM approaches advocating different roles for the state in facilitating ecological restructuring. The latter approaches argue that for EM processes to be successful, state intervention via ecological industrial policy is required. This article makes a unique contribution to the industry policy and EM debate by assessing the manner in which EM was conceptualised and implemented within the Australian government's automotive industry policy between 2007 and 2013. This analysis raises issues about the institutional capacity of states to pursue either weak or strong forms of EM. © 2015, Australian Political Studies Association.

Abstract: On 3 September 2009, Prime Minister Rudd announced a six-month Review of Australian Government Administration. He appointed an Advisory Group chaired by Terry Moran, Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, to prepare a discussion paper, oversee a benchmarking study and consultations, and craft a blueprint to reform the Australian Public Service (APS) in order to deal with future governance challenges. The vision is to develop a forward-looking, innovative, collaborative, citizen-focused, agile, informed and highly-skilled APS to advise and deliver policy and services for government. Ahead of the Game, a comprehensive Blueprint for action, was released on 29 March 2010. This article provides a high-level review of motivations and process for theMoran Review, an overview of the Blueprint, an assessment of the strategy and process, and suggestions for moving forward on selected issues. © 2010 The Author Journal compilation © 2010 National Council of the Institute of Public Administration Australia.

Abstract: Urban local governments are important players in climate governance, and their roles are evolving. This review traces the changing nexus of Australia's climate policy, energy policy and energy efficiency imperatives and its repositioning of urban local governments. We characterise the ways urban local governments' capacities and capabilities are being mobilised in light of a changing multi-level political opportunity structure around energy efficiency. The shifts we observe not only extend local governments' role in implementing climate change responses but also engage them as partners in conceiving and operationalising new measures, suggesting new ground is being opened in the urban politics of climate governance. A review of the Australian context provides important insights for the new politics of energy in the city as, internationally, energy efficiency is reframed as a climate change issue and the city is repositioned as an important strategic space in energy politics and the governance of energy systems. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2014.

Abstract: This paper presents the local institutional and organizational development insights from a five-year ongoing interdisciplinary research project focused on advancing the implementation of sustainable urban water management. While it is broadly acknowledged that the inertia associated with administrative systems is possibly the most significant obstacle to advancing sustainable urban water management, contemporary research still largely prioritizes investigations at the technological level. This research is explicitly concerned with critically informing the design of methodologies for mobilizing and overcoming the administrative inertia of traditional urban water management practice. The results of fourteen in-depth case studies of local government organizations across Metropolitan Sydney primarily reveal that (i) the political institutionalization of environmental concern and (ii) the commitment to local leadership and organizational learning are key corporate attributes for enabling sustainable management. A typology of five organizational development phases has been proposed as both a heuristic and capacity benchmarking tool for urban water strategists, policy makers, and decision makers that are focused on improving the level of local implementation of sustainable urban water management activity. While this investigation has focused on local government, these findings do provide guideposts for assessing the development needs of future capacity building programs across a range of different institutional contexts. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The National Gst and Commonwealth-State Financial Relations: A Neglected Issue

Abstract: While the introduction of the GST continues to dominate economic and political debate in Australia, in terms of its efficiency, equity and compliance cost implications, a neglected but important aspect of the tax reform package focuses on Commonwealth-State financial relations. A central feature of the reform is the replacement of a set of narrowly based and inefficient indirect taxes levied by the Commonwealth and State Governments with the national GST. This is accompanied by substantial reductions in personal income tax rates, giving rise to important implications for the degree of vertical fiscal imbalance (VFI), the efficiency of the States' tax regimes and the capacity of the States to maintain discretion over their fiscal regimes. The Queensland Government has claimed that the initial State compensation arrangements were grossly inequitable, and that subsequent features of the initiative will impede the Queensland Government's capacity to maintain its low taxation status.This paper concentrates on the themes of equity, VFI, State tax efficiency and the question of whether Queensland's days as a low tax State have been ended. Although the degree of VFI can be expected to increase, the elimination of selected State taxes and their replacement with the national GST should facilitate efficiency gains. Moreover, it is concluded that the capacity for the Queensland Government to adjust the remaining components of its tax base, together with the reapplication of the Commonwealth Grants Commission methodology for distributing GST revenues to the States from 2002-03, effectively means that the national GST need not pose a substantial threat to the Queensland Government's capacity to maintain its low tax status. The paper does not attempt to assess the precise impact of the national GST on the economic performance of particular industries in Queensland, which would require extensive econometric and statistical modelling and is outside the scope of this paper. © 2001 Economic Society of Australia (Queensland) Inc.

Abstract: The 2010 devastating floods in Pakistan have starkly reminded the world of the two critical, interrelated challenges confronting Pakistan: economic development and security. And whilst the Pakistan government's capacity to deal with these two issues before the flood was already shaky at best, its position now is even more precarious given the enormity of the task of rebuilding the infrastructure that has been destroyed in this latest natural disaster. Nuclear-armed Pakistan is a large and strategically important country, critically located on one of the world's most important geopolitical crossroads. It is a pivotal player in a region-covering the Middle East, Central Asia and South Asia-which has much potential, but which also has unresolved conflicts and various degrees of instability. Accordingly, because Pakistan is so important to the stability of the region and the world at large, it is vital that it be able to address successfully these twin challenges. © 2012 Copyright Australian Institute of International Affairs.

Abstract: Over the last two decades, recovery plans have emerged as one of the most widespread policy and management responses for endangered species. Often these plans include public and private lands, and the associated government departments and private landholders. Toolibin Lake, in the West Australian (WA) wheatbelt, is a case in point, with a recovery plan focused on an internationally recognized wetland on public land within a predominantly privately owned, agricultural catchment. This paper draws on recent questionnaire and interview-based research with landholders, to evaluate the influence of the recovery plan on conservation activities. Almost all landholders in the Catchment (93%) are involved in revegetation activities, with the availability of subsidies from the WA Government playing a strong role in adoption and its extent. The main constraints to adopting conservation actions, such as revegetation and fencing remnant vegetation, were cost and logistics. Correspondingly, the greatest incentive was financial inducement. Strengths of the recovery plan were identified as increasing awareness, demonstrating government effectiveness, and making funding available to landholders. The communication efforts by the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM), the agency leading the recovery process, were lauded while at the same time the need for improved liaison was noted. Weaknesses were the lack of information and direction from CALM, bureaucracy, limited funding for CALM, and variable adoption across the Catchment. Recovery planning in this Catchment and other similar settings could be improved by a continuing commitment to two-way communication between all those involved, ongoing recognition of the complexities of the government-community interface in recovery planning, and continuing subsidies for conservation actions on private lands where high biodiversity values are at stake.

Abstract: Business leaders are assumed to play an important role in the national leadership of liberal democracies, an idea supported by major political theories. Pluralists have focused on the often fragmented nature of business interests and point to the competing interests as they highlight the challenges of collective action that business leaders may have to confront in politics. This chapter discusses the capacity and power resources that business leaders bring to the task of exerting national influence or leadership and the impediments or constraints that these leaders have to deal in politics as well as the level of engagement they have with governments. As the chapter reveals answers to the inquiry, it also exposes how the operation of business influence and leadership in Australia is compromised by various institutional and ideological factors. © Oxford University Press, 2014.

Abstract: While the economic benefits of the resources boom in Australia have been considerable so, too, have the impacts upon host communities. These are particularly profound in settled regions where intensive mining presents amenity problems, housing shortages, increasing demands on infrastructure, environmental degradation and conflicts with other industries such as agriculture. Attempts to manage these challenges commonly occur through a 'governance' approach involving partnership and hybrid arrangements between a whole host of stakeholders from the corporate, state and community sectors. As the closest tier of government to the local level, local government has found itself playing a central role in mining governance, particularly in responding to and managing community concerns. This paper examines the role of, and challenges facing, local government in managing the impacts of mining - both alone and in collaboration with other governmental actors. It documents these issues as they relate to the resource needs, planning strategies, human capital impacts, service provision and institutional capacity of local governments in some of the most mining-intensive regions in Australia. © 2014.

Abstract: The commitment to recover water for the environment in the Murray–Darling Basin is unprecedented internationally. However, the use of water markets to reallocate water for the environment first occurred in the Western United States in the late 1980s as part of water reforms that remain ongoing. This paper explores lessons from institutional innovations in the Western United States, including design principles to coordinate environmental water management across jurisdictions and adapt to unintended consequences caused by socioeconomic and hydrologic interactions at multiple scales. Two decades of implementation experience in the Western United States suggest a middle path between top-down and bottom-up approaches: nested governance arrangements that invest in local institutional capacity while ensuring complementary state and federal roles for basin-scale integration and accountability. © 2011 The Economic Society of Australia

Abstract: This research note discusses the 2009 Defence White Paper, particularly its focus on the potential threat the Chinese military might pose to the security of the Asia-Pacific in the foreseeable future. It also examines Chinese responses to the White Paper's main theses. It concludes that the White Paper marked a departure from the Howard government's policy of de-emphasising differences in Canberra's dialogue with Beijing and, by re-affirming commitment to the alliance with the United States (US), delineated the limits of Australia's partnership with China. However, its poorly substantiated predictions regarding the rise of China's power, the US economic and military decline and Beijing's geostrategic objectives raise doubts about the Rudd government's capacity to formulate a coherent vision for the future of Australia's relations with China. © 2010 Australian Political Studies Association.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Convergence without diffusion? A comparative analysis of the choice of performance indicators in tax administration and social security

Abstract: This article cross-nationally compares the choice of performance indicators in two core fields of state activity, tax administration and social security. Exploring the selection of performance indicators in six countries (Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and the US), the article analyses the driving forces for the choice of particular indicators in the context of national administrative traditions and more recent reform agendas on the one hand and the trend towards international exchange and 'benchmarking' on the other hand. The article explores the relative significance and interaction of different driving forces of choice and how this shapes the development and application of performance indicators. To that end, it combines instutionalist approaches with the literature on the mechanisms and effects of international exchange and policy diffusion. Our analysis suggests that existing broad similarities are linked to similarities in core activities and values underlying contemporary public service reforms. Variation in the choice of performance indicators (PIs) reflects domestic factors such as governance arrangements through which broad reform trends are filtered. These arrangements also mediate any direct international learning. Points for practitioners: This article aims to contribute to the debate around how organizations could learn from the experience of others in designing performance indicators and management systems. Potential for cross-national and cross-sectional learning is particularly high in categories where a particular organization has not yet developed performance indicators but others have done so already. But any cross-reading from other countries' choices should take into account that the definition and use of performance indicators is to a substantial extent driven by domestic institutional traditions, governance arrangements and wider national approaches to performance management. The design of performance indicators should in particular take into account the accountability relations in which agencies are embedded. © 2008 IIAS, SAGE Publications.

Abstract: This article examines recent debate over core or 'independent' integrity institutions in the Victorian and Commonwealth governments to highlight some of the need, and potential, for more careful deliberation over options for building the capacity of integrity systems - the second of the analytical themes used in Australia's national assessment. The first part compares resourcing of major integrity institutions by Australian governments over the past 15 years. Staffing and finances are seen as a useful basic measure of capacity, helping lift attention away from the assumption that creation of new bodies necessarily increases capacity. The data also show that some jurisdictions - including Victoria - may yet have some way to go if they wish to match other governments. The second part of the analysis identifies eight further issues for consideration in deliberations on institutional design. Our conclusion is that by working through such issues more systematically, it may be possible to identify new or different institutional options for configuring integrity resources. This could help avoid inappropriate choices - whether unnecessary new bodies, overloads on existing ones or the import of frameworks that do not necessarily 'fit' local conditions - of particular relevance to current proposals for a new Commonwealth anti-corruption agency. © National Council of the Institute of Public Administration, Australia 2005.

Abstract: This monograph examines the challenges facing major city regions in coping with dynamic processes of societal change. Particular attention is paid to the structure of metropolitan governance and the contribution of strategic spatial planning frameworks in managing urban development processes, focusing on recent experiences in Greater Manchester, Metropolitan Melbourne and the Greater Toronto Area. The study exemplifies the processes and inherent tensions involved, focusing on issues of economic competitiveness, social equity and cohesion, and the promotion of sustainably compact urban form. Institutional capacity-building measures are set firmly, however, within overarching neo-liberal perspectives, generating considerable tensions that clearly demonstrate the difficulties of translating metropolitan-wide visions into local implementation realities. The study concludes that the growing complexity of multi-nodal metropolitan structures and the increasing significance of interactional networks, linkages and flows within and beyond metropolitan boundaries, makes the task of metropolitan governance problematic.

Abstract: This paper documents the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party's (FPLP) approach to globalisation under four different leaders, starting with Paul Keating in the early 1990s, and ending at the early stages of Mark Latham's leadership in 2004. It argues that, despite some notable differences, there was a considerable degree of consistency in Labor attitudes to globalisation under successive party leaders: globalisation was seen as inevitable, irreversible, as beneficial for the majority of the population, and as destructive to states' capacity to intervene in the economy. The paper suggests that a number of factors explain Labor's continued support for globalisation in the face of growing public discontent, including the pressures of international institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and big business, ideological factors, and comparatively low levels of economic growth, both in Australia and internationally. © 2005 Australasian Political Studies Association.

Abstract: The issue of why so many young adolescents around the world are disengaging from school and making the choice to drop out is one of the most intractable, vexed, perplexing, and controversial issues confronting educators. Tackling it requires courage and a radical rethinking of school reform around issues of power, ownership of learning, and the relevance of schooling and curriculum for young lives. This means a heightened institutional capacity to "listen." This article describes an instance of a disadvantaged urban Australian government school that realized it had little alternative but to try new approaches; "old ways" were not working. The article describes an ensemble of school reform practices, philosophies, and strategies that give young adolescents genuine ownership of their learning. This school stands out as a beacon that school reform is possible, even for young adolescents from the most difficult of circumstances. However, such approaches look markedly different from where mainstream educational reform is taking us at the moment. Copyright © by Teachers College, Columbia University.

Abstract: Introduction. Institutions play a central role in advancing the field of reproductive health in humanitarian settings (RHHS), yet little is known about organizational capacity to deliver RHHS and how this has developed over the past decade. This study aimed to document the current institutional experiences and capacities related to RHHS. Materials and Methods. Descriptive study using an online questionnaire tool. Results. Respondents represented 82 institutions from 48 countries, of which two-thirds originated from low-and middle-income countries. RHHS work was found not to be restricted to humanitarian agencies (25%), but was also embraced by development organizations (25%) and institutions with dual humanitarian and development mandates (50%). Agencies reported working with refugees (81%), internally-displaced (87%) and stateless persons (20%), in camp-based settings (78%), and in urban (83%) and rural settings (78%). Sixtyeight percent of represented institutions indicated having an RHHS-related policy, 79% an accountability mechanism including humanitarian work, and 90% formal partnerships with other institutions. Seventy-three percent reported routinely appointing RH focal points to ensure coordination of RHHS implementation. There was reported progress in RHHSrelated disaster risk reduction (DRR), emergency management and coordination, delivery of the Minimum Initial Services Package (MISP) for RH, comprehensive RH services in post-crisis/recovery situations, gender mainstreaming, and community-based programming. Other reported institutional areas of work included capacity development, program delivery, advocacy/policy work, followed by research and donor activities. Except for abortion-related services, respondents cited improved efforts in advocacy, capacity development and technical support in their institutions for RHHS to address clinical services, including maternal and newborn health, sexual violence prevention and response, HIV prevention, management of sexually-transmitted infections, adolescent RH, and family planning. Approximately half of participants reported that their institutions had experienced an increase in dedicated budget and staff for RHHS, a fifth no change, and 1 in 10 a decrease. The Interagency RH Kits were reportedly the most commonly used supplies to support RHHS implementation. Conclusion. The results suggest overall growth in institutional capacity in RHHS over the past decade, indicating that the field has matured and expanded from crisis response to include RHHS into DRR and other elements of the emergency management cycle. It is critical to consolidate the progress to date, address gaps, and sustain momentum. © 2015 Tran et al.

Abstract: The regulatory approval for commercial cultivation of biotech cotton in USA, China, Australia, Mexico and Argentina was given as early as 1996, but it was not until 2002 and 2005, that it was approved in India and Brazil, respectively. Such trends of asynchronous approvals and late adoption are common with other biotech crops, too. There are several reasons: lack of regulatory system or framework, institutional capacity of risk assessment, overcautiousness of the public and governments, location-specific needs, intensive protests by anti-GM lobbies, and strengths of private sector breeding and R&D capacity.This study confines itself to examining the regulatory systems/frameworks and biosafety requirements in countries where biotech cotton is grown so as to understand the factors governing approvals, the lessons learnt in dealing with cultivation of the first generation of GM crops – genetically engineered (GE) cotton – and future trends. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

Abstract: The Philippines enacted the Clean Air Act 1999 (CAA) to provide a comprehensive air pollution control policy in the country, adopting an ambient air quality and emission-based monitoring and regulatory framework. Other major policy features of the CAA include introduction of market-based approaches, a ban on incineration, and the conversion of the Environmental Management Bureau from a staff to a line bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. With such key policy shifts, there has been an expectation that the CAA would improve air quality, particularly in urban centres where health-related costs of air pollution have been estimated to be around US$430 million per annum. However, the CAA has suffered implementation difficulties. This article analyses the institutional, regulatory and policy approaches adopted by the CAA and identifies the various issues besetting its implementation, from unfunded mandates to lack of institutional capacity. The paper concludes that the lack of political and financial support has resulted in a series of telling implementation gaps. Additionally, the legislation of stringent uniform ambient quality and emission standards and the imposition of compliance deadlines have only aggravated the implementation deficit. The policy and regulatory strategies need to be redefined to fit the political, socio-cultural and economic realities of the country. © Australian Centre for Environmental Law Sydney 2005.

Abstract: Private nature reserves created by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are increasing, and their growing number and extent means that they can potentially contribute to biodiversity goals at a global scale. However, the success of these reserves depends on the legal, economic and institutional conditions framing their creation and management. We explored these conditions, and the opportunities and challenges facing conservation organizations in managing private nature reserves, across several countries, with an emphasis on Australia. Results from 17 semi-structured interviews with representatives of private conservation organizations indicated that while private reserves may enhance the conservation estate, challenges remain. Legal frameworks, especially tenure and economic laws, vary across and within countries, presenting conservation organizations with significant opportunities or constraints to owning and/or managing private nature reserves. Many acquired land without strategic acquisition procedures and secured funding for property acquisition but not management, affecting the long-term maintenance of properties. Other typical problems were tied to the institutional capacity of the organizations. Greater planning within organizations, especially financial planning, is required and NGOs must understand opportunities and constraints present in legislative frameworks at the outset. Organizations must establish their expertise gaps and address them. To this end, partnerships between organizations and/or with government can prove critical. © 2011 Fauna & Flora International.

Abstract: It has taken almost 15 years for an Australian government to again proceed with major financial reform. Earlier this year, the then minister for finance when introducing new legislation implementing the reforms under one Act (the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013) noted that the system was 'not broken' but that it 'creaks at times'. That Act represents about one half of the proposed reforms but is central to their success. One of the more interesting aspects of the reforms is that they were developed in an open process with the involvement of both public and private sector advisers over a three-year period and oversight by the Department of Finance, similar to the approach taken with the ground-breaking public service reforms in Australia in the 1990s. The focus is largely on financial reform as part of good governance, stressing performance and accountability, but also giving prominence to risk management and the associated notion of 'earned autonomy' and less 'red tape'. In addition, attention is given to the need to establish a governance framework that recognizes the increasing co-operation and collaboration across agencies and entities, across governments at all levels and across sectors of the economy. We continue to learn from research in both the UK and Canada in particular, recognizing both the similarities and differences between the public and private sectors. © 2014 © 2014 CIPFA.

Abstract: The dominant perspective in the literature linking governance, globalization and public policy argues that globalization undercuts state capacity, weakening a government's ability to effectively regulate its domestic affairs. This paper shows otherwise with special reference to the Australian experience in financial regulation. It challenges the conventional wisdom that the Australian state is weak and cannot adopt anticipatory industrial policies. This paper argues that the adoption of the 'twin peaks' model of financial regulatory arrangements is an example of the existence of government-led steering in Australia which can adopt a proactive approach to financial regulation by steering and coordinating policy networks. 'Governance through hierarchy' in the financial services industry may be a function of the government's political entrepreneurship; its skill in setting and implementing an agenda; and an ability to create new policy communities and networks. © 2009 The Author.

EIA predicts that consumption will double from 1.3 tcf in 1999 to 2.6 tcf in 2020, with a 3.4%/yr increase. Shell's Baja plant will have send-out capacity of ≤ 1.3 bcf/day. The facility worth around $500 million will come onstream in 2006. Shell and El Paso would construct a regasification terminal on Mexico's east coast, in Altamira, Tamaulipas state. Capacity at the $300 million unit will expand to 1.3 million cu ft/day and will come onstream in 2004. El Paso and Phillips Petroleum plans another terminal in Baja, which will take 4.8 million ton/yr of LNG sourced from a facility being developed by Phillips near Darwin, Australia. The receiving terminal should be onstream in 2005 with output of 680 million cu ft/day. Marathon Oil together with Pertamina of Indonesia, Bermuda-based Golar LNG, and Grupo will bring a 750 million cu ft/day plant that will come onstream in 2005. The terminal will be constructed south of the US-Mexico border city of Tijuana.

Abstract: This article focuses on an ad hoc body, the UK Local Government Pay Commission, as a means of developing a broader argument on the relationship between collective dispute resolution and the nature of public service reform. It suggests that the character of disputes in this sector and the 'fitness for purpose' of those institutions designed to resolve them are critically related to an industrial relations agenda, which is in turn shaped by changing forms of public service provision. An extended period of public service 'modernization' in local government led to a restructuring of collective bargaining with substantive and procedural consequences: new issues emerged and related tensions arose that could not be managed by the traditional bargaining machinery or by the use of existing third-party conciliation or arbitration mechanisms. It required relatively novel arrangements in the form of the LGPC whose nature and operation and lessons are discussed. © Industrial Relations Society of Australia.

Abstract: Municipal planning represents a key avenue for local adaptation, but is subject to recognised constraints. To date, these constraints have focused on simplistic factors such as limited resources and lack of information. In this paper we argue that this focus has obscured a wider set of constraints which need to be acknowledged and addressed if adaptation is likely to advance through municipal planning. Although these recognised constraints are relevant, we argue that what underpins these issues are more fundamental challenges affecting local, placed-based planning by drawing on the related field of community-based environmental planning (CBEP). In considering a wider set of constraints to practical attempts towards adaptation, the paper considers planning based on a case study of three municipalities in Sydney, Australia in 2008. The results demonstrate that climate adaptation was widely accepted as an important issue for planning conducted by local governments. However, it was yet to be embedded in planning practice which retained a strong mitigation bias in relation to climate change. In considering the case study, we draw attention to factors thus far under-acknowledged in the climate adaptation literature. These include leadership, institutional context and competing planning agendas. These factors can serve as constraints or enabling mechanisms for achieving climate adaptation depending upon how they are exploited in any given situation. The paper concludes that, through addressing these issues, local, place-based planning can play a greater role in achieving climate adaptation. © 2011 The Author(s).

Abstract: For reporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2004, Australian companies were required to disclose the expected impact of applying Australian equivalents of International Financial Reporting Standards effective from 1 January 2005. The objective of this paper is to examine the association between the level of disclosure and corporate governance quality. Using a sample of listed companies with 30 June balance dates, we find that the quantity of disclosure was positively related to some aspects of superior corporate governance, such as the frequency of board and audit committee meetings and the choice of auditor. © 2007 The Authors.

Abstract: This study examines two aspects of corporate social responsibility (social and environmental CSR) in 15 Asian countries. The performance of firms in these Asian countries on the two types of CSR is also assessed relative to country economic, political and social conditions, and compared with those of other regions (Western Europe, East/Central Europe, Australia/New Zealand, US/Canada, Middle East and Africa). Drawing from over 8700 surveys of firms in 104 countries, this study demonstrates substantial country and regional differences in CSR. Firms are embedded in different country contexts, with differing underlying institutional capacities. Strong revealed relationships between CSR and country economic, political and social contexts reflect the importance of a country's development of such institutional capacity to promote and support CSR practices.

Abstract: The imperative of “think global, act local” takes on a pressing urgency in any strategic discussion of reforming local government functions and capabilities. A crisis management “literacy” would indicate a more comprehensive reform and re-design agenda for local government than is currently being recognized. This paper identifies a crisis management literacy appropriate for broadening and enhancing local government capabilities within a globalizing context. It identifies major reforms undertaken recently in Australian local government and, clearly, reinforces an awareness of the inadequacy of managerialist and economistic reforms undertaken from the perspective of managerial and governance capacities required to respond to identifiable vulnerabilities and predictable “creeping crises” manifest within local government communities. A new globally-informed “localism” is urgently required within on-going debates about the extent, and adequacy, of the reform agenda in Australia. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Abstract: This paper analyses how effectively local government in Australia performs its functions as a key element of subnational governance. Service delivery and local democracy are identified as the core functions of local government. The analysis takes into account paradigms of public administration, democracy and management, the public organization, accountability and capacity. The concept of 'capacity' brings together many of the issues discussed in this paper. Questions of capacity relate to whether local governments are effectively performing their institutional functions, how they do so with regard to principles of good governance, and whether the dimensions of their capacity can be reformed if there was the need to meet additional demands. © 2015, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Abstract: Confronted by limited resources and the pressures of cutback management, reductions in force (RIFs) have received much attention from both practitioners and scholars in the public sector in recent years. It has often been argued that a RIF constitutes a very difficult task for administrators, who are universally reluctant to lay off personnel, and that enormous levels of organizational stress are experienced when workforce reductions become necessary. Nevertheless, a strategically planned RIF, along with other productivity improvement strategies, may help conserve valuable human resources even in uncommonly bad economic times. This article examines best practices followed in managing a RIF in the Australian Public Service and suggests factors that should be considered for successful RIF processes in the public sector elsewhere, should the necessity arise. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

Abstract: Protected areas that are created to safeguard environmental values such as Indigenous culturescapes may in fact significantly fail in this task. This study concerns such an instance in far north-west Tasmania, where the government adopted a multiple-use resource conservation-development management model for the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area (APCA). The model offers protection of cultural heritage values whilst permitting numerous community recreational and commercial uses. One particular objective is to protect 'an extraordinary richness of Aboriginal cultural heritage' in one of Earth's great archaeological regions (DPIWE, Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area Management Plan, 2002, p. iii). Yet under the auspices of multiple use, Aborigine and others report unremitting damage and loss of ancestral values. To examine how this is so in an actively managed protected area, perceptions of 16 environmental professionals and local residents engaged in APCA planning and management are used to identify three major challenges for appropriate custodianship of the Aboriginal cultural landscape: Aboriginal-Eurocentric conflicts; limited community governance capacities; and deficient regulatory provisions. It is concluded that APCA multiple-use management of heritage conservation is ineffectual and that an alternative governance model is required urgently. The management challenges examined here offer insights for problematic Indigenous cultural heritage conservation in other jurisdictions of Australia and elsewhere.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Terrorism in Southeast Asia

Abstract: Since September 2001, the United States has increased focus on radical Islamist and terrorist groups in Southeast Asia, particularly those in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. Southeast Asia has been a base for terrorist operations. Al Qaeda penetrated the region by establishing local cells, training Southeast Asians in its camps in Afghanistan, and by financing and cooperating with indigenous radical Islamist groups. Indonesia and the southern Philippines have been particularly vulnerable to penetration by Islamic terrorist groups. Members of one indigenous network, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which has had extensive ties to Al Qaeda, helped two of the September 11, 2001 hijackers and have confessed to plotting and carrying out attacks against Western targets. These include the deadliest terrorist attack since September 2001: the October 2002 bombing in Bali, Indonesia, that killed approximately 200 people, mostly Westerners. Since the Bali bombing in 2002, crackdowns by various governments in the region-encouraged and in some cases supported by the U.S. government and military- are believed to have weakened JI to such an extent that it essentially is no longer a regional organization, but rather is one confined to Indonesia, with some individuals still operating in the southern Philippines. The degrading of JI's leadership structure is believed to have altered the group's strategy. More violent, anti-Western JI members have formed breakaway cells. In September 2009, Indonesian authorities claimed they had killed the leader of one such cell, Noordin Mohammed Top. Noordin is believed to have been responsible for organizing the near- simultaneous July 17, 2009 bombings of the J.W. Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta. The bombings were the first successful anti-Western terrorist attack in Indonesia in four years. Their sophistication triggered speculation that Al Qaeda had renewed ties with Top. To combat the threat, the U.S. has pressed countries in the region to arrest suspected terrorist individuals and organizations, funded and trained Indonesia's elite counter-terrorist unit, and deployed troops to the southern Philippines to advise the Philippine military in their fight against the violent Abu Sayyaf Group. It has also launched a Regional Maritime Security Initiative to enhance security in the Straits of Malacca, increased intelligence sharing operations, restarted military-military relations with Indonesia, and provided or requested from Congress substantial aid for Indonesia and the Philippines. Also, since 2001, Thailand and the United States have substantially increased their anti-terrorism cooperation. The responses of countries in the region to both the threat and to the U.S. reaction generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics. In general, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the United States and Australia, whereas Indonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to its citizens. Since that time, Indonesian authorities have been aggressive in their pursuit of terrorists and extremist groups. Many governments view increased American pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the political sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream Islamic and secular nationalist groups. The Muslim insurgency in southern Thailand has escalated in recent years as has terrorist activity in southern areas of the Philippines. The report looks at the rise of Islamist militancy and the JI network, and discusses terrorism in the region, concluding with options for U.S. policy. Strategies include placing greater emphasis on attacking institutions that support terrorism, building up regional governments' capacities for combating terrorist groups, and reducing the sense of alienation among Muslim citizens. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Abstract: This paper looks at the tension between official multiculturalism, understood as a nation-building project that seeks to incorporate migrants into a unified national community even while recognising and fostering their difference, and the extra-national identifications, connections and practices that characterise really existing or everyday multiculturalism in Australia. This tension will be explored by way of the experiences of Vietnamese, Lao, Cambodian, Turkish and Burmese Mon communities in Sydney and Canberra. It argues that the 'new' multicultural subjects dwell between assimilation and transnationalism in a way that challenges our ability to theorise them, and the multicultural nation-state's capacity to recognise and engage them. In future research on migration in Australia, we will need to continue to take cognisance of the established nature of migrants' claims to national belonging and the reality of their local cultural becomings and hybridities; and at the same time take account of the lithe and multi-scalar nature of their identifications beyond the boundaries of proximate community, locality and nation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Abstract: Purpose: The aim of this paper is to identify the factors that are responsible for the slow development of the renewable energy sector in the Pacific Island countries (PICs), and suggest ways of overcoming them. Design/methodology/approach: The paper compares the energy situation in Australia and Germany to that in the PICs, and the state of energy development in the PICs to its African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) counterparts. Findings: The paper finds that policy frameworks are important pre-requisites to the development of renewable energy. In addition, the absence of a science and technology base in the PICs is a serious impediment to the development of the renewable energy sector in these countries. It is found that the PICs are lagging behind in policy frameworks and institutional capacity building requirements as compared to other ACP countries. Practical implications: Policy frameworks must be established as an essential pre-requisite to the development of renewable energy in the PICs. In addition, ways and means must be found to address the lack of proper attitudes amongst decision-makers to the value of a science base in development. Originality/value: The paper identifies the underlying impediments to the rapid development of the renewable energy sector in the PICs, and suggests what could contribute to the lack of an appropriate science base that is considered as a requirement to development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: This article explores how organizational policy capacity can be developed, drawing on a study conducted in a large human services agency in Australia. Building policy capacity within government agencies is widely acknowledged as important for successfully responding to complex policy problems. The existing literature suggests a range of strategies for building organizational capacity. Findings from interviews with policy workers support the principles for building policy capacity identified in the literature but uncovered a surprising degree of scepticism pointing to significant barriers to their realization. These barriers are identified as emerging out of the tensions between policy capacity and two other domains of governing capacity: administrative capacity and state capacity. These tensions however are highly contingent and dynamic; managing them requires a degree of discretion and judgement, in brief, policy leadership. A focus on developing policy leadership at the level of policy units and teams may present a strategic approach to building organizational capacity for policy work. © 2011 The Editor.

Abstract: Community housing organisations are set to become a key vehicle to build and manage a significant increase in Australia's stock of affordable rental properties. Given that organisations in the sector vary considerably in terms of size, activity, institutional capacity, rate of growth, urban/rural location and regulatory environment - are there any insights from current practice that can guide new housing policy initiatives? Based on a non-random qualitative survey by the Community Housing Federation of Australia (CHFA) of 21 diverse community housing organisations nominated by their state peak body, this paper finds two main common themes. First, there is a shared determination to develop sustainable organisational structures, while there is increasing divergence between growth and traditional housing providers. Second, there is an understanding that community housing organisations need to carefully manage relationships, particularly with state governments and tenants, and overcome capacity constraints through building stronger networks. The paper concludes with recommendations on capacity building initiatives to help frame the delivery aspects of affordable housing policy in Australia, and provides suggestions for future research.

Abstract: Sustaining our community infrastructure and assets is potentially the greatest challenge faced by Local Governments across Australia. At risk is the continued sustainability of assets which support the delivery of many of our community services. Most states have identified a substantial emerging gap in Local Government's capacity to renew it assets. We suggest the problem is broader than the conventional asset management activities and fundamentally requires that we have informed debate at both the national and local levels. In order to have such an informed debate we need access to reliable, consistent and relevant information. However, experience has shown that trying to obtain this information is difficult. In most cases it does not exist and where it does exist it is frequently inadequate. This paper outlines a project that is currently in progress that aims to develop a national framework for the exchange of community asset information. As a result we hope to be able to inform the debate that must occur if we are to solve the issue of the renewal gap for community assets.

Abstract: Recent work on industry policy argues that group and state capacity are important in underpinning (or undermining) the capacity to govern industrial development. Put simply, group capacity - alongside state capacity - is deemed an important ingredient in any recipe for (re)developing national industry. This article further develops the literature on governance and transformative capacity, adding deliberative networking as a key facet. Examining the development of the organic farming sector in Australia, it is argued that the absence of transformative capacity frustrates development. Specifically, although the state has slowly come to see a need for some interaction and facilitation of organic industry development, particularly of a national domestic standard, this intervention is made difficult by the absence of: (i) capable organic industry organisations; (ii) 'in-house' departmental expertise; and (iii) venues capable of fostering policy deliberation. We argue that the reworked concept of transformative capacity can have wider application in making sense of industry development in other infant industries. © 2008 Australasian Political Studies Association.

Abstract: The expanding provision of affordable housing by non-profit community housing organisations, coupled with possibilities of substantial stock transfer from State Housing Authorities, suggest Australia's social housing sector may be entering a transformative phase. Based on a review of restructuring in Britain, where over the last 25 years, traditionally owned and managed 'council housing' has been reduced from over 90 per cent to less than 30 per cent of overall social housing stock, this article considers possible policy implications for Australia. In particular, it analyses British experience which could inform Australian decisions on organisational size, institutional vehicles and governance structures within the context of the future programme of stock transfers envisaged by many commentators on the Australian housing scene. © 2010 Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research.

Abstract: Formulating sustainable forest policy has become a crucial issue today with the increased awareness of global environmental problems including global warming and climate change. Public participation has been identified as an integral part of sustainable forest policy. However, formulating ecologically sustainable forest policy has been a highly contentious and divisive issue. One of the stand out difficulties has been the inadequate institutional capacity to harness the benefits of community participation in forest policy making. Forest institutions frame how society use and manage forest resources. They also determine how society acquires scientific and behavioral information and how this information is communicated and applied in the forest policy process. This chapter examines the community participation in the Australian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) process from an institutional economics perspective. The RFA is regarded as the most ambitious, comprehensive and expensive land-use planning exercise ever to be undertaken in Australia. It was designed to minimize problems associated with resource conflicts related to conservation and development. Participatory and deliberative approaches have been used under the RFA to accommodate a wide range of environmental and socio-economic values. However, the achievements to date have been unsatisfactory. The failures can be attributed to poor rule configurations that constrain or direct action during community consultation, lack of integration of community values into the policy process and inadequate conflict resolution mechanisms. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Abstract: We report on the establishment of communities of practice at four Australian institutions and evaluate their effectiveness and durability as a means of building staff and institutional capacity for interdisciplinary teaching. A community of practice approach is a potentially valuable methodology for overcoming dynamics of fragmentation, isolation and competition within universities. The communities we established were anchored by a shared focus on the topic of climate change and they worked collaboratively to build relationships of trust and reciprocity between teachers in a wide range of disciplines. The aim of each community was to improve the teaching of climate change through enabling members to integrate diverse disciplinary perspectives, to teach collaboratively, to promote innovation through exchange and to demonstrate leadership within their institutions. The key factors that made our communities effective and durable are: (1) designation of two leadership roles, activator and facilitator, (2) provision for institutional autonomy in domesticating the model to fit local circumstances and (3) a pragmatic emphasis on opportunities for teaching innovation and leadership within existing administrative structures, teaching programs and workloads. We conclude that suitably designed and resourced communities of practice are a viable means of improving interdisciplinary teaching of complex problems by facilitating both staff development and institutional learning. © 2013 HERDSA.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Why did Divisions of General Practice implement some Access to Allied Psychological Services mental health initiatives and not others?

Abstract: Objective The Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) programs implemented through Divisions of General Practice (now Medicare Locals) enables general practitioners (GPs) to refer consumers with high-prevalence mental disorders for up to 12 individual and/or group sessions of evidence-based mental health care. The great strength of ATAPS is its ability to target vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations. Several initiatives have been introduced that focus on particular at-risk populations. This study aimed to determine the factors that had influenced Divisions' decisions to implement the various Tier 2 initiatives. Methods An online survey was sent to all Divisions. The survey contained mostly multiple choice questions and sought to determine which factors had influenced their decision-making. Results The most common factors influencing the decision to implement an initiative were the perception of local need and whether there was an existing service model that made it easier to add in new programs. The most commonly cited factors for not implementing were related to resources and administrative capacity. Conclusions This research provides valuable insights into the issues that primary care organisations face when implementing new programs; the lessons learnt here could be useful when considering the implementation of other new primary care programs. What is known about the topic? Previous evaluations of ATAPS have shed light on some of the factors that act as barriers to the implementation of new mental health initiatives by Divisions operating in primary care, but there is nothing known about why Divisions choose to implement some programs over others. Previous research suggests that 'barriers' to change, as reported by organisations, may be constructions that are used to make sense of a situation and that the real impediment to change are intra-organisational factors such as the self-identity of organisations. What does this paper add? This paper reports on a survey that was undertaken with Divisions regarding the reasons they chose to implement particular mental health initiatives. The paper provides insight into the barriers that Divisions perceived when implementing new mental health programs. They were primarily cited as funding and resource barriers. The findings also provide further indirect evidence of the role of the self-identity of organisations in change. What are the implications for practitioners? The study has some implications for government policy development both locally and internationally. For instance, it is likely that primary care organisations such as Divisions, especially smaller ones, require support in terms of increased funding and resources if new mental health initiatives are to be successful. Mandating the delivering of initiatives also contributes to their successful uptake. It is likely that as primary care organisations become more experienced with implementing new mental health programs, the perceived barriers will reduce and implementation will occur with more ease. © 2015 AHHA.

Abstract: The Henry Tax Review is a work in progress, but it has already advanced sufficiently to constitute an important case study of state capacity in Australia. Using the Henry Tax Review as a case study, this paper sheds light on the question of whether the national political system is capable of devising and implementing long-term reforms. Whilst specific policy failures inevitably have a contingent dimension in the form of poor strategy and leadership or unfavourable economic conditions, the paper discusses the erosion of institutional and relational structures which, arguably, has diminished systemic political capacity. This is tantamount to a structural weakening of state capacity in Australia, a development which has the potential to erode the potential of any government to enact significant strategic policy change. © 2011 Australian Political Studies Association.

Abstract: Water markets have featured prominently in the reallocation of water rights to restore freshwater ecosystem health. Incentive-based water rights acquisition and transactions have emerged as a market-oriented policy approach to reallocate water resources from existing uses to enhance the provision, regulation, and sustainability of freshwater ecosystem services. This paper develops a conceptual framework to examine factors enabling and constraining successful policy reform and implementation in market-based environmental water allocation. This analysis distills and extends the findings and lessons of a September 2007 workshop in Brisbane, Australia on environmental water transactions. Two case studies were selected in water stressed basins - the Columbia (U.S.A) and Murray-Darling (Australia) Basins - where transactional approaches to environmental water allocation first emerged. The case studies draw upon practitioner perspectives and previous policy and economic analysis in two regions where shared political economic and physical conditions lend a strong analytical basis for comparison. A common set of policy and regulatory reforms has occurred in both cases - albeit in different forms and via distinct paths - to develop three enabling conditions: (1) establishment of rights to and limits on freshwater extraction and alteration; (2) recognition of the environment as a legitimate water use; and (3) authority to transfer existing water rights to an environmental purpose. However, these elements of policy reform are necessary but not sufficient for effective implementation; a second set of driving forces, barriers, and adaptations explains the ability to achieve larger scale ecological outcomes. These conditions include the physical, social and economic factors driving demand for environmental water allocation; administrative procedures, organizational development and institutional capacity to effect transfers; and adaptive mechanisms to overcome legal, cultural, economic, and environmental barriers. The case study analysis suggests that environmental water transactions can play an important role in establishing environmental water allocations, although water markets require ongoing institutional capacity and adaptive governance. The conceptual framework and empirical lessons generated through this cross-case comparison provide the basis for an expanded research agenda to evaluate the design and performance of market-oriented reforms as implementation experience accrues and new programs emerge in diverse ecological and political economic settings. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: In many cases, when governments commit themselves to green policy targets, they also imply the development of 'green' industries to reach those targets. But, how do governments foster the development of such industries? This is particularly relevant because such industries are often in a very early stage of their evolution. Taking the case of organic farming, we argue that the state's ability to foster 'policy capacity' is critical to the emerging development trajectories of such industries. Focussing on the state's ability to generate policy capacity in the Danish and Australian organic food sector, this article suggests that policy capacity develops as a result of high levels of state and associative capacity and the ability to create conditions favourable for corporatist deliberation. The comparative study undertaken demonstrates that these conditions are met in the Danish case, resulting in a high level of policy capacity. By contrast, Australia suffers from a low level of policy capacity as a result of low state and associative capacity and lack of corporatist deliberation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract: New public management (NPM) has been the dominant orthodoxy in analysing public service reform with major implications for employment relations. Drawing on comparative studies of major OECD countries, including Australia, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United States, this article examines recent reforms of public service human resource management. It refutes the proposition that reforms indicate convergence towards an NPM model and argues that the 'varieties of NPM' thesis is also unconvincing. Several reform trajectories exist which have sought to modernize public sector pay, performance and working conditions, but these highlight the existence of alternative models rather than a shift towards NPM or even the emergence of 'varieties of NPM'. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract: Recognising both the importance of intertidal wetlands and their role in mosquito-borne disease we discuss wise management to conserve wetland values and to reduce vector borne disease health risks. First we summarise the mosquito-borne diseases associated with intertidal wetlands in sub-tropical and tropical Australia. We consider the Ramsar Strategic Plan, its reflection in some key Australian statutes and the relationship between environment-focussed legislation and health legislation. This is followed by a brief overview of mosquito control and its impact on human health. Using a salt marsh example of an integrated process, we describe the development of what was, in the 1980s in Australia, a novel method of habitat modification (runnelling) for mosquito control. Runnelling modifies the tidal water flow on salt marshes, reducing mosquito larval numbers and minimising environmental impacts. The approach is related to two of the Ramsar goals (wise use and institutional capacity and effectiveness). We then describe the extension of its rationale to a complex mangrove system. Finally, with a concept model, we consider the convergence between minimal habitat modification for wetland conservation and human health protection using an interdisicplinary approach involving multiple stakeholders. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: This article examines policy capacity in the context of Australian health authorities in relation to the challenges confronting policy workers and senior managers in these agencies. The article reports the challenges identified by our informants in relation to political structures, roles and responsibilities of other portfolios and governments, interactions between policy officials and with the minister and the minister's office, whole of government policy approaches, stakeholder and public demands and expectations, and media pressures. The experience of these senior managers and policy workers is then reinterpreted in terms of a nodal governance model. The findings from the Australian study on policy capacity, interpreted in the context of nodal governance, is then used to discuss the features of "governance capacity" as articulated in the matrix model of policy capacity developed by Wu, Ramesh and Howlett (2015).The article concludes with propositions for strengthening policy capacity across the governance regime so depicted. These include: capacity building for individuals at various key locations in the network; organisational capacity building within the organisations and across their key relationships; and reforms across the governance network as a whole. © 2015 Policy and Society Associates (APSS).

Abstract: This paper reports and analyses findings from a qualitative study that explored the impact of organizational policy, cultures and support structures on the research pathways of early career researchers within one Australian university. The author captured the perspectives and experiences of six early and six senior researchers and examined the degree to which respondents perceived their university was effective in supporting the early career researcher to sustain and progress their research. As this paper explores, giving voice to academics' lived experiences of research raised questions as to the efficacy of existing institutional support structures as significant gaps between internal research policy and the lived research experience on the ground were revealed. Ultimately, understanding academics' lived experiences of research may not only build institutional knowledge to inform and enhance institutional capacity to more effectively sustain and grow quality research, but also strengthen advocacy for much-needed and targeted external research funding. © 2012 Copyright European Higher Education Society.

Abstract: In their Institutions for the Earth (1993), Haas, Keohane and Levy argue that, at the international level, three fundamental conditions must be met for the effective management of environmental problems. They summarise these conditions as the three 'Cs' - the building of concern; the existence of a suitable contractual environment; and the growth of state capacity. We applied the Haas, Keohane and Levy (HKL) model to three case studies at the national level, in order to ascertain the extent to which the three Cs explained the emergence of successful institutional regimes. We found that two of the three variables - improvements to the contractual environment and increases in state capacity - had considerable explanatory power. Concern was important in providing the motive force for change, but high levels of concern did not lead to effective institutional regimes unless the other two factors were present. We found a strong reciprocal relationship between state capacity and the contractual environment - the ability to monitor solutions and to generate policy-relevant 'trustable' information, was positively associated with improved negotiating structures and outcomes.

Abstract: This paper develops the argument that a country's institutional arrangements and government policies can squander opportunities for the creation of sustained competitive advantage, by locking a resource-based industry into low-quality, high-volume production. The argument is illustrated with the case of the Australian meat industry, which started with promising prospects, but lacked the institutional arrangements for coordination of firm strategies, and lacked policy guidance to upgrade technologically and to seek new markets, resulting in competitive stagnation and rising levels of foreign ownership. © 1998 Carfax Publishing Ltd.

Abstract: Liberal democratic states like Australia manage criminal justice issues in ways which reflect an inbuilt tension between liberal and democratic values. Liberal democracies are responsive both to liberal claims and to democratic claims. As a result, policy debates and strategies can oscillate between (on the one hand) liberal sensitivity to individual rights and opposition to enhanced state capacity and (on the other hand) democratically legitimised community norms and collective values. Four crime-related policy debates - about the creation and operation of the National Crime Authority, about strategies for combating drug-related crime, about gun control legislation and about identity systems to counter money laundering, tax evasion and public benefit fraud - illustrate the characteristic liberal democratic mode of politics in operation. The spectrum of policy responses to crime issues within liberal democratic political systems corresponds to an analogous spectrum within criminology which encompasses individualistic and structuralist conceptions of the nature and causes of crime.

Abstract: A remarkable process of reform of intergovernmental arrangements was initiated in Australia in 1990 designed, according to its proponents, ‘to improve our national efficiency and international competitiveness and to improve the delivery and quality of services governments provide’. Unlike previous ‘new federalisms’ in Australia (and elsewhere) the reform process on this occasion was neither totally unilateral, nor top‐down in design and implementation. Rather, while reflecting the commonwealth (federal) government's frustrations at the limits imposed by the federal system on its political power and administrative capacity, the process intentionally was cooperative, incorporating all state and temtory government leaders, and including representatives of local government. In the context of a review of the origins, nature and objectives of the reform initiative, this article points both to the valuable innovations embodied in its processes, and to the risks of reduced political access and citizen participation created by its attempts to apply ‘single‐government’ managerialist principles to the redesign of intergovernmental arrangements in federal systems. Political and bureaucratic objectives, combined with a lack of adequate appreciation of federal principles, led, in our view, to an attempt to supplant participatory politics with relatively less accessible and responsive managerial structures.

Abstract: Performance measurement and programme evaluation have been promoted as a central mechanism of recent Australian public sector (APS) reform. Outlines recent reforms in the APS and identifies links between evaluation and performance information. Identifies the major issue of credibility, when performance information is produced internally and not verified externally. A lack of performance systems and standards can create difficulties for both internal and external programme evaluations. Concludes that: reforms introduced to evaluate performance in the APS were promoted with high expectations which have only partially been fulfilled; the present system is internally focused with a narrow role for evaluation and a lack of credibility because of the independence issue; the present systems associated with the performance approach and its evaluation are not providing enough information to deal with the tough questions of the effectiveness of government programmes. Proposes that a middle ground between internal and external programme evaluation strategies be adopted. This allows the strengths of internal evaluation to be retained. At the same time, it allows the possibility of improving programme evaluation by adding external independent verification and an extended effectiveness role.

Abstract: In the context of calls for a 'third way' which proposes the abandonment of many of the social democratic and statist commitments of the postwar era, this paper reviews both the responsibilities accepted by peak bodies such as ACOSS and those that ought to be retained by government. It is sceptical of claims that social policy debates in Australia lead to the conclusion that welfare state development here has been satisfactory. Social democratic objectives (derived from intellectual contributions in the 1940s and 1950s as well as from the comparative political economy of the 1980s and 1990s) emphasize more decommodified provision of services than can be readily admitted in Australia. If the demand for social welfare and social policy continues to increase to the extent suggested by past and present circumstances, serious implications emerge for both public and private providers.

Abstract: Abstract:  Since World War Two, the role of non profit think tanks in the United States has grown and diversified. Today, the United States' government and Congress is advised on many matters of policy‐making and implementation by such think tanks. The Westminster system of parliament, as practised in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, has rarely provided a fertile ground for the creation and sustained existence of such privately operated institutions. Despite limited links with similar United States' organizations, the seeds have never really flourished outside the United States of America. Australian Commonwealth governments have been most antagonistic in this regard. On the other hand, management consulting companies, many of which have headquarters in the United States, lobbyists, and corporate representation flourish in the quasi‐corporatist political environment carefully constructed by the Australian Labor party (ALP) government since 1983. Policy‐related research divisions and statutory authorities have likewise grown in size and importance within the departmental agencies of government itself. Energy, agriculture, immigration, and social service research “arms” have been encouraged within the ministerial arena of policy analysis and advice. Especially important has been micro and macro‐economic research, urban and infrastructural planning, the Industry Commission, and the Bureau of Industry Economics, respectively. This paper will analyse the growth of these specialized forms of government think tanks, study the range of their ministerial advice, and speculate about their changing role in an increasingly “managerialist” type of Westminster‐style parliamentary setting. Sommaire:  Aux États‐Unis, depuis la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, le rôle des groupes de réflexion à but non lucratif, ou think tanks, a pris de l'ampleur et s'est diversifié. Aujourd'hui, ces groupes prodiguent des conseils au gouvernement et au Congrès des États‐Unis sur de nombreuses questions de définition et de mise en oeuvre de politiques. Le système parlementaire de Westminster, tel que pratiqué au Royaume‐Uni, au Canada, en Nouvelle‐Zélande et en Australie, a rarement favorisé la création et l'existence de telles institutions exploitées par le secteur privé. Malgré certains liens limités avec des organisations américaines similaires, elles ne se sont jamais vraiement épanouies à l'extérieur des États‐Unis. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Abstract: Given the increasing importance of constitutional modification in Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Africa, Europe, and Australia, it is imperative to study systematically the conditions under which formal constitutional amendments are likely to fail. In this paper, the authors isolate conditions whereby the instrumental objectives of participants in the politics of constitutional modification threaten to overload the institutional capacity of the amending process. The proximate cause of amendment process overload is indeterminacy regarding the redistributive impact of the proposed change. Redistributive indeterminacy is a function of a rigid amending process, an institutional structure that encourages a large number of constitutional players and amendments which provide broad scope for judicial interpretation. The authors isolate two critical factors: the intensity of mass and elite preferences surrounding constitutional proposals and the structure of the amending process itself. They next trace these factors back to institutional variables to create a model to explain and predict constitutional failure in a range of contexts. Finally, they apply the model to highly visible recent constitutional failures in the United States and Canada.

Abstract: This article argues that political leadership in liberal democracies is measured by the achievement of goals. In order to achieve their goals leaders must overcome constraints and exploit opportunities in the social and economic environment. This is done through the deployment of the institutional capacity at their disposal which carries with it a set of constraints and opportunities. We argue that it is the way in which leaders deploy their institutional capacity which illustrates their own particular leadership style. We do so, with reference to industrial relations reforms of the 1990s, first in Victoria under Jeff Kennett and then in Western Australia under Richard Court. We argue that in this case, leadership style determined the success of achieving policy goals, and thus defined successful political leadership.

Abstract: This article examines the governance challenges facing Australian local government, which include lack of constitutional standing, intergovernmental dependencies, financial constraints and weak democratic standing. The historical context has shaped the nature and place of local government in the Australian federal polity and has contributed to the tensions created by an expansion of the roles and responsibilities of local government, especially in the provision of services, which is not matched by concomitant increases in financial capacity and local autonomy. These governance challenges are discussed with a view to establishing local government’s capacity for autonomous self-governance in the face of intergovernmental and fiscal dependencies, and the implications of this for local government reform trajectories.

Abstract: This article critically analyses the landmark reform of the Victorian court system from a comparative international perspective. It is argued that the institutional design of Court Services Victoria (’CSV’) was largely driven by a desire to protect judicial independence from the executive government and partly also to enhance the institutional capacity of the judiciary to eff ectively respond to the emerging social, political and legal challenges. Despite the establishment of CSV, the legislation preserves certain legacy administrative arrangements that impeded court administration in the past, such as the internal governance arrangements in the courts and the absence of clearly defi ned lines of administrative responsibility. The article also argues that the legislation confers too narrow a function on CSV that focuses on the provision of basic technical and administrative support to the courts. The proposed alternative would be for CSV to assume a much broader developmental mandate in the court system in order to improve the quality of the administration of justice. The article also argues that greater “corporatisation” of the judiciary will be necessary in order to protect its hard-fought independence and visibility in the political arena. The article concludes that greater judicial independence requires more, rather than less, political astuteness and engagement by the judiciary with the other branches of government and the public.

It appears than non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from developed and developing countries should not be viewed as a united bloc, as organisations from the developing countries appear to be more favourably disposed to intergovernmental processes than their “northern” counterparts. Regional results of “southern” developing country NGOs in the Asia-Pacific show a similar trend. The paper supports the contention that a reappraisal of how north-south relations should be understood, in the context of climate negotiations, is required.

Abstract: court’s new public role in light of a number of recent decisions and emerging doctrines that have attempted to redefine the commercial landscape of acceptable business conduct - the new developments in doctrine in contract law are linked to court’s desire to expand its private role of corrective justice into a larger public role involving the implementation and enforcement of public regulatory objectives - courts taking on a more interventionist approach as a means of addressing problems relating to market abuse, market failure and declining commercial morality in modern day contracting - whether courts have the institutional capacity, skill, expertise and information required for public regulation.

Abstract: Peer review of economic policies by countries comprises peer learning, peer support and peer pressure. Durable peer review processes focus on mutual peer learning and support as peer pressure rarely works unless countries can be convinced that a policy is in their national interest. It requires a high degree of trust and respect, sharing of information, analytical and administrative capacity and legitimacy. Proximity may lead to greater trust and openness, but it may also be associated with long-standing historical differences and grievances. In principle peer review could be a useful adjunct to other aspects of a regional integration strategy designed to bring mutual benefit to the participating countries. In the Asian context there appears ample scope for well designed peer review to contribute to domestic policy development.

Abstract: Issue addressed: A key factor underpinning the ability of people to build physical activity into their everyday life is a suitable physical environment. The physical environment is outside the jurisdiction of the health sector and, at the local level, is primarily the responsibility of local government through local planning functions. There are few studies assessing the opportunities for local government to work with health on promoting participation in physical activity. Methods: Using semi-structured interviews, a case study of one council’s organisational capacity to promote physical activity was conducted. Results: The results show that while health and physical activity were not necessarily seen as core business of council, they linked in with council’s commitment to community wellbeing and environmental development. A unifying theme was the opportunity for a partnership between health promotion and local government bodies to promote a positive, local lifestyle. Conclusion: The findings provide a sound basis for pursuing a partnership in the case of this council and point to the value of further research, exploring how these themes apply more generally and the extent to which this potential is realised in practice. So what? Systematic analysis of council’s capacity to contribute to promoting physical activity can be used to guide the development of a comprehensive, intersectoral approach to this task.

Abstract: Melbourne Water’s Living Rivers Program works in partnership with local governments to build collective capacity to implement Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD). An assessment tool to quantify the change in capacity and identify individual needs for driving capacity improvement within local government was created and applied. Known as the Needs Analysis, the tool identifies relative municipal capacity against nine predetermined themes, each identified as fundamental to the delivery of WSUD. The tool provides a snapshot of internal commitment and resourcing for the management of WSUD, and a basis for strategic program interventions. A comparative analysis of results from the first (2006/07) and second (2010/11) phases of the Needs Analysis is presented. In summary, 83% of local governments have increased in their capacity to deliver WSUD. Differing levels of capacity are evident between inner, outer and rural/regional municipalities. There are also common attributes between high, medium and low performing councils, where institutional impediments such as commitment and policy significantly influence a council’s capacity to deliver sustainable stormwater management. Insights from the Needs Analysis are shaping the program design to tailor to individual and regional capacity needs of local government, thereby stimulating further capacity growth.

Abstract: Despite the billions of dollars invested in improving Indigenous health and wellbeing outcomes in Australia, there is little evidence of program effectiveness to inform policy and practice. The deficiency of evaluations is problematic. Critical to this process is the effective engagement of commissioners with Indigenous peoples, which is not well documented. Currently, there is scant evidence on modes of commissioning practices used. This scoping review will aim to identify the spectrum of commissioning practices used when evaluating Indigenous health and wellbeing programs in Australia, codifying them into a model set. Documents (between 2008 and 2020) will be retrieved from Scopus, Proquest, Informit, Google Scholar and via a web-based search that refers to the commissioning of Indigenous health and wellbeing program evaluations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada or the United States. Importantly, the research team is Indigenous-led and the project’s governance, quality and translation framework will be informed by a project advisory group, including Indigenous associates. This will be the first scoping review globally to identify practices used to commission Indigenous health and wellbeing program evaluations. Results will be utilised to strengthen the commissioning practices of Indigenous health and wellbeing programs in Australia and overseas.

Abstract: In the context of climate change, the Danish water sector is experiencing two major pressures. On one hand, a number of agents are pushing towards more sustainable urban water management (SUWM) approaches with the aim of improving surface water quality and mitigating flood risk. On the other hand, as part of an international trend, the municipal water management departments were transformed to locally created not-for-profit corporatized companies. Main drivers for corporatization are increased efficiency and cost recovery by reduced municipal control on utility budgets. Scholars have described the influencing factors for transitioning to SUWM and highlighted the potential governance attributes for enhancing and/or constraining such change. This paper explores the corporatization of the water sector and its implications for transitioning to SUWM. On the base of a preliminary literature review we identify the rationales for and drawbacks of corporatization and compare them with the critical factors to build institutional capacity for SUWM. Preliminary results suggest that corporatization is expected to create a range of challenges that might hinder the transition towards more SUWM approaches. A more direct collaboration of the national regulator of competitive performances with government institutions and other nongovernmental actors might be an effective answer to such challenges.

Abstract: This paper considers the implementation of new whole-of-government arrangements in Indigenous Affairs. It outlines key aspects designed to address Indigenous disadvantage, including the COAG trials, bilateral agreements, Indigenous Coordination Centres, and Shared Responsibility and Regional Partnership Agreements with Indigenous communities. It situates these within broader experience of “new governance” approaches in Australia, and then considers some of the governance capacity issues that are highlighted as governments attempt these arrangements in Indigenous Australia. It considers some key findings from evaluations of the COAG trials and from research on Indigenous community governance, which each provide lessons for governments and Indigenous communities if new governance arrangements are to lead to better outcomes for Indigenous people.

In South Australia, the Public Health Act 2011 makes local government responsible, for the first time, for taking action to preserve, protect and promote public health within its area. Similar legislation has been enacted in other states. In this letter we discuss the evaluation of a local government project and what this tells us about the capacity of local government to deliver effective health promotion programs.

Abstract: This article discusses some aspects of a larger study conducted to explore the challenges and barriers to implementing an integrated urban water management (IUWM) strategy in Adelaide. It is based on an internet survey of 55 key actors representing various stakeholder groups from both the public and private sectors. While the key actors identified several challenges and barriers, this paper focuses on two factors: organisational culture and institutional capacity. Clearly the stakeholders perceived these as barriers to implementing IUWM and clarified that some of the other challenges, such as ownership and access rights, are related to the “new” water sources such as stormwater and recycled wastewater.

Abstract: This paper concerns the Australian Government’s call for a resource rent tax for iron ore and coal; and extension of the existing rent tax for petroleum. Our main objective has been to address the Australian Government’s conduct of the tax reform consultation process for its proposed resource rent tax legislation. To ascertain the Government’s effectiveness in the consultative process toward legislative design, our focus is on the contentious issue of the method for valuation of starting-base assets (or capital assets) because of their deductibility from revenue subject to tax. This paper analyses relevant stakeholder submissions to the Government’s request for input on the valuation of starting-base assets for Australia’s proposed resource rent taxes. We use the perspective of stakeholder theory and grounded theory methodology. The results of our research indicate that the Australian Government has lacked effectiveness in this consultation process. The contribution of this paper is of a grounded theory that frames three recommendations to improve the consultation process. We anticipate that the adoption of these recommendations would enhance the legitimacy of outcomes and promote taxpayer confidence in the resource rent taxes as well as eventually improve compliance.

Abstract: As the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) progresses through its implementation, calls for stewardship of the new disability market increase. As a personalisation scheme, the condition of the disability service markets are tied to the ability for people with disability to access care services. Market conditions such as thin markets, market gaps and market failure threaten the public policy goals of increased choice and control for NDIS participants. We review the evidence for interventions and other market stewardship actions that can be taken by government to steward a quasi-market that provides care or welfare services. We assess the breadth and quality of the evidence base and apply these findings to the case of the Australian NDIS. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to take actions to steward the NDIS market, but that considerable resources and governance capacity are needed to do so.

Abstract: In the middle of the last parliamentary brawl over pricing carbon emissions in Australia, a Liberal-voting friend pointed out to me that we should be paying more attention to adaptation. He was referring to strategies that address vulnerability to climate change, such as poverty reduction, education and building institutional capacity. Adaptation includes infrastructure such as sea-walls, drainage systems and early warning protocols.

Abstract: The need to change urban water management to become more sustainable is widely recognised. Recently there has been considerable financial investment in urban water reform; however these reforms have not been as successful as anticipated, most likely because there is a lack of critical analysis of existing capacity and/or capacity deficits. Understanding and assessing institutional capacity is crucial to addressing existing institutional impediments. Institutional capacity includes the human resources, intra-organisational, inter-organisational and/or external rules and incentives capacity spheres. Institutional capacity assessment is essential to form coherent and demand driven capacity development strategies. This paper proposes a tentative institutional capacity assessment framework derived from a meta-analysis of empirical research, across five different disciplinary areas, into capacity attributes most likely to advance sustainable urban water management. Forty-two publications were reviewed and the most frequently determined capacity attributes identified. The proposed schema of enabling capacities for sustainable urban water management could be used by policy makers and practitioners for city-wide strategic planning of future investment in capacity building. This would improve the opportunity for critically informing and improving the design of current and future water reform practices.

Abstract: This article examines the implementation of the African Union counter-terrorism framework by member states. It argues that the state level governance involved in implementing AU policy provisions is often ineffective due largely to a lack of relevant capacity by many African states. This article first critiques terrorism and the military approach to counter terrorism by member states; then evaluates institutional capacity in a number of African states, showing that they often lack sufficient security governance to implement AU policies; and concludes with an evaluation of the inability of member states to contain Islamophobic tendencies within their jurisdictions.

Abstract: The “new age” of transparency heralded a raft of reforms to the “Freedom of Information Act 1982” (Cth) (FOI Act 1982) that shifted control of information away from government in a bid to increase transparency and accountability. Conclusive certificates, for example, were abolished in 2009 and a number of exemptions, including the exemption for deliberative documents, were made conditional on a single public interest test in 2010. Transparency is not, however, an absolute and cannot be an end in itself; it has value only insofar as it enhances accountability. Even then, the proper balance must be struck between transparency, efficiency and effectiveness. This paper considers the role and importance of transparency and its relationship to the public interest test in the FOI Act 1982. It examines the basis and impact of recent reforms and asks whether they do, in fact, strike the right balance in respect of the deliberative processes of government. Have the reforms resulted in more accountability or less? Is there a danger that we now have “too much of a good thing”, that is, transparency, but that efficiency, effectiveness and even accountability have been inappropriately compromised?

Abstract: To date social research into the institutional aspects of sustainable urban water management has predominately been conducted in developed urban contexts, resulting in a significant lack of insight into the institutional drivers and barriers in developing urban centres, which this research begins to address. This research project investigated the understanding, perceptions and motivation relating to the transition to sustainable urban water management practices in the rapidly growing urban centre of Port Vila, Vanuatu. The need for improved urban water management, practitioners’ awareness of potential solutions, barriers and opportunities to implement solutions were investigated through semi-structured, in-depth interviews with more than 40 individuals who were identified as having a significant role in urban water management from national and local government, aid and development agencies, consultants, and the tourism sector. The data analysis revealed that in contrast to developed contexts where socio-institutional barriers are the primary barriers to transitioning to SUWM, in Port Vila there continue to be a number of technical barriers limiting the potential to transition. Skills development regarding both technical and socio-institutional capacity will be essential for enabling the transition to SUWM in Port Vila in the coming years.

Abstract: Economic narratives of northern remote Australia frequently identify the attraction of large-scale resource projects as being pivotal to regional development prospects. Yet whereas such projects may generate significant benefits to the national economy, their impacts at the regional scale are more ambiguous. This paper seeks to decentre the resources sector as a regional development engine in northern remote Australia. Using recent research from the Kimberley region, it emphasises the economically detached regional character of contemporary resource projects and, in contrast, brings into focus the importance of public sector monies in underpinning local expenditure flows. For regional development practice, this analysis implies attention to (i) strategies that aim to encourage or oblige resources companies to strengthen their connections with the regions in which they operate and (ii) the facilitation of institutional capacity building, so that local communities are more able to articulate regional development aspirations and to negotiate with outside investors.

Abstract: Government infrastructure provision is much more important than its conception in mainstream economic theory as a response to “market failure”. In practice, it draws on the state’s capacity to fund investment in large projects and bear the associated risks. Investing in infrastructure can also be an engine for accelerating economic growth, meeting community needs and serving diverse societal goals such as equity and sustainability. These broader considerations create an expectation for it to feature particularly prominently in any Labor government’s program.

Abstract: Developing and nurturing resilience is critical to the social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) of Indigenous Australian adolescents and their continuing life trajectories. The attendance of many Indigenous adolescents from remote communities at boarding schools creates a need to prioritise and proactively create opportunities that build and nurture student resilience. This requires sustainable and multi-dimensional school-wide approaches. Despite this need, there are no documented SEWB or resilience building approaches for Australian Indigenous students who attend boarding schools. We describe the use of participatory action research to develop and implement a two-year STEP-UP intervention with boarding schools, designed to create supportive environments for improving psychosocial resilience and wellbeing of remote-living Indigenous students. The intervention consisted of three components implemented annually across eight schools: a site-specific STEP-UP action plan; staff capacity development; and an annual Schools and Communities Conference. Thematic analysis of a systematic literature review, documented action planning, conference group processes, resilience theory and survey findings from the associated broader resilience study resulted in the identification of six resilience building domains: valuing culture and identity; developing cultural leadership; nurturing strong relationships; building social and emotional skills; creating safe, supportive environments; and building staff capacity. These domains became the resulting framework for STEP-UP planning and enabled focused examination of practices and future planning. Learnings from the intervention process suggest principles to consider when designing interventions: utilising a strengths-based approach; design responsiveness; collaborative partnerships; institutional capacity; and sustainability. A resilience toolkit website was developed to enable knowledge translation and sustainability beyond the study.

Abstract: Tax jurisdiction is a legal concept, but it is fundamentally dependent on state capacity, technology and politics. The jurisdictional boundaries of the tax state are in turn crucial in delimiting its taxing power. This article considers how tax jurisdictional concepts, in particular residence, source and the location of consumption, are changing as the capability of states to tax labour, capital and consumption changes in a global digital economy. These changes are occurring through contestation in the “borderlands” of the tax state, between multiple states and non-state actors. Governments can enhance tax capability by cooperating with each other and with global intermediaries and by adopting new technologies, but also take contradictory steps to abrogate tax jurisdiction. The article illustrates the discussion with examples of tax jurisdiction for individuals as residents, workers, investors or consumers; and for corporations, including recent global developments aimed at taxation of multinational enterprises.

Abstract: Blair’s Britain came to an end in June 2007 when, after ten years and one month, Tony Blair stepped down as Prime Minister. His decade in office will be remembered for many things: for ending eighteen years of electoral wilderness for the Labour party, albeit only by re-branding it as “New Labour”; for delivering unprecedented Labour majorities in the House of Commons; for the ruinous foreign policy misadventure in Iraq; for a curious and from no point of view altogether satisfactory combination of continuity and change in domestic public service reform; and for historic constitutional change. It is with this last feature that the present paper is concerned. Blair never wanted his legacy to be constitutional reform. He was never much interested in it and he inherited Labour’s commitment to deliver important parts of it from his (Scottish) predecessor, John Smith. Had Blair felt able to escape from these commitments, it is likely that devolution, at least, would not have been delivered under his premiership. As it is, however, constitutional reform might turn out to be the single most positive achievement of his decade in Downing Street.

Abstract: Chinese academics and officials argue that the country must store water to overcome seasonal fluctuations and move water to rebalance regional differences in supply and demand. As well as supplying water, however, such projects protect the political and economic status of powerful municipalities, stimulate Chinese economic growth, and proclaim the power and administrative capacity of the state. Underpinning Promethean water management is a hidden “empire”-China’s water machine-that assembles the capacities of corporations and institutions in an international network that facilitates state schemes. Yet, fixed infrastructure and their deterministic projections collide against shifting water demands and political interests and require subtle reconciliation of competing interests.

Abstract: Outsourcing Repression: Everyday State Power in Contemporary China, Lynette Ong’s new book with Oxford University Press, provides an original and realistic analysis of the Chinese state’s control over society beyond the usual focus of the study of authoritarian states, such as on outright coercion or censorship. Her concept of “everyday state power” sheds light on how the state’s control is typically experienced by ordinary citizens and illuminates the state’s repertoire for inducing citizens’ compliance with its top-down, sometimes drastic, policies. The “thugs-for-hire” are an expedient extension of the state’s formal coercive capacity, while the political, social, and economic brokers constitute the state’s penetrative “infrastructural power”. While grounded in the study of China’s state-driven urbanisation, this book also opens new space for us to understand the sources of the Chinese state’s power more broadly, especially how it manages to mobilise the masses in the implementation of radical policies that are often highly intrusive and disruptive. As such, the book can also inform our understanding of the zero-Covid policy currently being enforced in Shanghai and other Chinese cities: besides outright coercion, the state also deploys “brokers” with intimate knowledge of communities to “persuade” the masses into compliance, often on an emotional basis. The book calls for greater attention to the complexity of the interface between the state and society to decipher both the state’s capacity to govern and society’s capacity for resistance.

Abstract: The development of a Needs Analysis Tool by Melbourne Water builds on previous social research and other investigations into local government capacity for sustainable urban water management. The Tool provides a snapshot of internal commitment and resourcing for the management of stormwater quality and Water Sensitive Urban Design, and forms one component of Melbourne Water’s Stormwater Program’s assessment and development of structural and non-structural stormwater management initiatives with local government.  This Tool offers a practical and rapid way to track changes in the capacity of local government to deliver sustainable improvements in stormwater quality, with the benefits of the Needs Analysis Tool being two fold. Firstly, it identifies individual needs of local government, and allows for projects to be designed that address these specific capacity building requirements and intra-organisational issues. Secondly, it provides for a facilitative, partnership approach between local government and Melbourne Water that maximises the strengthening of internal capacity through effective project design and delivery. This multi-layered innovative approach is a move away from more traditional water grants programs and provides for a more sustainable funding model and inter-governmental partnership approach.

Abstract: In 1973, the first named women’s studies subjects to be taught in Australia were offered at Flinders University in Adelaide and at the University of Queensland. The first independently located program was introduced at the Australian National University in 1975, celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary in August 2001. In 1999, celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex in at least three women’s studies centres in Australia (at the Universities of Tasmania, Queensland and Hinders University) also indicated the institutional capacity of Australian women’s studies to commemorate its past. In 1999, too, Hecate celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. Established in 1975, Hecate was preceded by Refractory Girl in 1973, the first women’s studies journal to be established in Australia. Australian Feminist Studies was established in 1985. This article interrogates the common assumption that women’s studies in Australia has shifted from a commitment to the liberation of women as a unity to a more complicated and theoretical project informed by the post- discourses: postmodernism, postcolonialism, post-structuralism, psycho-analysis. The question is explored through a reading of Refractory Girl, Hecate and Australian Feminist Studies and interviews with the editors of Hecate and Australian Feminist Studies: Carole Ferrier, Bronwen Levy, Susan Magarey and Sue Sheridan.

Abstract: Local Government is a key agent in sustainable tourism management through its roles in: planning; economic development; marketing; regulation; land and facility management; service provision; industry assistance; and community relations. Local Government, especially in regional Australia, is the public sector agency most closely linked to sustainable tourism agents in industry and community. A number of Local Government roles and responsibilities as they relate to sustainable tourism management are identified. Interventions aimed at improving sustainable touri sm management would be assisted by the capacity of Local Government to engage with these agents and perform these roles and responsibilities. The capacity of Local Government with regards to sustainable tourism management in Vic to ria may be hindered by issues of: isolation; access to resources; training and skills of key staff; internal conflicts; and the planning and governance of Local Government participation in tourism. Structures employed by Local Governments might be exploited to increase the capacity to implement sustainable tourism objectives. A survey was conducted to investigate these structures in terms of Local Government capacity to: integrate tourism related responsibilities within Council; conduct strategic planning; maintain relationships with external tourism stakeholders; implement tourism strategies; adequately resource tourism management; and maintain involvement with industry. Findings of the survey indicated that many of the core structures to enhance management capacity were in place in most Local Governments; however, there was a lack of understanding of the breadth of sustainable management implications arising from tourism activity. There was also a clear perception that Local Government did not adequately encourage sustainable tourism development. Local Government education programs may be developed to address these issues.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Water recycling and decentralised management: The policy and organisational challenges for innovative approaches

Abstract: Achieving sustainable urban water management for developed cities is likely to require continuing and significant paradigm changes for planners. Demand management thinking has already largely replaced supply augmentation perspectives, and there are a growing number of new technologies for water recycling and other innovative approaches such as decentralisation geared toward minimizing water withdrawals and pollution. However successful implementation of new approaches to wastewater management is a multi-faceted challenge requiring input beyond merely technical. Controversy and community opposition has stalled some innovative projects. As a result, there has been some recognition not only of the need for functional, cost effective technology, and protection of the environment and public health, but also for social acceptability. This paper takes the social acceptance theme a little further, probing questions of institutional capacity and decision-making processes across water management organizations, as these are considered equally important to sustainable water outcomes as merely whether or not the public will accept a technology.  This critical review of case studies of water management planning suggests that societal and institutional adaptation are critical issues for sustainable water management and highlights the need for significant change in the implementation of alternative water management strategies. Changing patterns of water use is a process of long-term institutional transformation. Based on this analysis, future policy directions should focus on facilitating stable predictable arrangements for making policy decisions in civic groups. This will involve long-term institutions for continuous negotiation among diverse stakeholders about meanings, values and relationships.

Abstract: The 2006 World Bank report “The Pacific Infrastructure Challenge” noted that infrastructure performance in Pacific countries is worse than in other small island states. A lack of long term planning (in both governments and aid donors), budget provision for maintenance, institutional capacity and co-ordination has led to diminished social, environmental and economic benefits to stakeholders after major assistance from donors has been completed.  Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) developed and applied a process to help address these issues, piloted on an infrastructure programme in the Solomon Islands (funded by the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and managed by SKM) in December 2008. The process involved a series of meetings and a full day workshop with SKM, government and RAMSI representatives. It led to the definition of specific issues and objectives for the programme and the development of an action plan, based on a framework of economic, environmental and social sustainability issues. The process was successful in translating the concept of sustainability into the specific project context (provision of sustainable building infrastructure in the Solomon Islands) and facilitating a shared understanding of what “sustainability” meant to stakeholders, which had not existed before. On this basis, a common action plan was designed to implement the sustainability objectives set jointly during the engagement process.  The identified objectives of good budget planning and asset management, stakeholder co-ordination, capacity-building and community ownership address the key issues highlighted in the World Bank report. The success of the engagement process is clearly demonstrated by large parts of the action plan being adopted by the Solomon Islands Government. Improvements in budget planning and asset management have been instigated and are currently being implemented. Integration of these actions into existing project management processes will lead to better economic, social and environmental outcomes throughout the life of the project and infrastructure.

Abstract: In early 2006, the Victorian Government released the Yarra River Action Plan, which allocated $20 million towards tackling urban stormwater pollution. To ensure this money is allocated in an equitable and transparent manner across all metropolitan local governments a multi-criteria assessment tool has been developed. This paper presents an overview of the multi-criteria assessment tool developed and adopted for selecting structural Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) projects that are eligible for funding through Melbourne Water’s Stormwater Programs. This tool considers three types of indicators: environmental, engagement (engagement with stakeholders and local government capacity building), and financial. Within each category, a series of descriptive indicators of different weightings are applied to score a project: an overall score of 0.45 being required for the project to be accepted. Where initial concept designs do not satisfy this criterion, additional work is undertaken to refine and improve the project. The tool and its use are illustrated with a case study.

Abstract: Initial US efforts to rebuild and rehabilitate Iraq were a failure. This failure was all but guaranteed by the mistaken confidence that senior levels of the US Government held in Iraqi Government capacity. Once the inability of the Iraqi Government to govern was realised, efforts to take over their responsibilities were equally fraught due to a lack of planning and properly skilled personnel. By this time, much critical time had been lost in establishing an effective information management plan, and insurgent propaganda had taken root. Substantial sums of money and prodigious effort were employed to rectify the governance and information problems, but to limited effect due to a further lack of planning. Having identified these problems and learned some difficult lessons, the US V Corps formed an integrated, synchronised “C24” cell at MNF-I, incorporating the C7 (Engineer), C8 (Comptroller) and C9 (Civil Military Operations, or CMO) positions into a “one stop shop” for CMO, synchronising its efforts and shaping all of V Corps into a powerful force for “constructive engagement”. Shortcomings still exist, however, and harnessing the full capabilities of the interagency is the only way to overcome them.

Abstract: Cultural change is often positioned as central to transformation within the Australian Public Service (APS). The ongoing focus on cultural change suggests it has not yet been realised, which is unsurprising, given it is so difficult to change. However, cultural change may also be impeded due to the way it is portrayed within the APS. This article draws on the work of Schein to identify three problems with how organisational culture and cultural change are portrayed in the APS, including the focus on a unified APS culture, the simplistic way in which culture is portrayed, and the general and high-level claims for how to achieve cultural change. It provides three recommendations for how these problems can be addressed, including focusing on high-level principles for conduct across the APS (rather than a unified APS culture), focusing on cultural evolution at the department, agency, and subunit levels, and supporting cultural evolution through establishing mechanisms for behavioural change. Adopting this approach could enable the APS to realise desired changes and enable success of the Albanese Government's APS reform agenda.Points for practitionersCultural change is difficult to achieve due to culture being deeply embedded, underpinned by a stable system of values, beliefs, and assumptions.Change could be realised within the APS through focusing on cultural evolution, rather than cultural change-specifically at the department, agency, and subunit levels where there is some compatibility between existing and desired cultures.Cultural evolution requires the identification of the specific behaviours required for effective change, followed by a reconfiguration of a range of mechanisms required to embed and reinforce behavioural change.Leaders play a central role in facilitating behavioural change and cultural evolution, but doing this effectively may require leadership cognitive shifts; therefore, leaders need support and development.

Abstract: The sustainable urban water management system is likely to be characterised by complex and flexible governance arrangements, increased inter-organisational interaction and wide stakeholder participation, which contrasts significantly with the traditional approach. Recently there has been significant financial investment in urban water reform, however the reforms have not been as successful as anticipated and numerous institutional barriers remain. Understanding and assessing institutional capacity is central to addressing institutional impediments. Institutional capacity comprises individual, intra- and inter-organisational and external rules and incentives capacities. This paper reports on the first case study of a social research project that aims to develop an institutional capacity assessment framework. Empirical data from semi-structured interviews with 59 water industry experts in Sydney, Australia, and a broad literature survey were used. The key capacity attributes identified could form the basis of an institutional capacity assessment tool and reveal common and differing attributes across stakeholder groups which provide insight into stakeholder relations. Synthesis of the results revealed that intra- and inter-organisational capacities were facing particular challenges and should be explicitly addressed in reform, policy and capacity development initiatives.

Abstract: This paper is about the capacity of the federal government in Australia to achieve its stated water management and environmental goals in relation to the Murray-Darling River system via its Murray-Darling Basin Plan of 2012. The paper uses a 'state capacity' approach. One aspect of state capacity is about the state's broad institutional capabilities; these are the ways in which the state's resources and policy instruments, its institutions, and its knowledge and data capabilities can shape the state's capacity to achieve its stated goals. The second aspect is relational, emphasising the notion of 'infrastructural power', or how states might be able to achieve their goals by working cooperatively with major interlocutors in the broader state or in society. These two aspects are typically viewed from a state-centric perspective, with the state depicted as using its broad institutional capacities to help further its relational or infrastructural power over other interlocutors. In contrast, this paper shows how this process has been reversed, and how key interlocutors, including important players in federal and state governments and powerful irrigation interests, have instead drawn resources from and manipulated the key institutional elements of state capacity to suit their own interests, weaken the federal state's infrastructural power, and subvert the stated aims of the Basin Plan.

Abstract: New legislation was introduced in 2018 in Victoria, Australia to encourage the negotiation of affordable housing agreements. This change resulted in the expansion of formal and informal mechanisms for cross-sectoral affordable housing delivery. In this paper we draw on 20 interviews with housing stakeholders, focusing on the process of negotiation. We propose a novel theoretical framework to interpret capacity for collective action in a loosely regulated policy area, combining insights from negotiation theory and Institutional Capacity Development (ICD) literature. We find widespread concerns about the opaque, inefficient and potentially exploitative nature of outcomes. We also find that agreements varied across projects based on levels of trust; access to information; political capital; capacity for mutual gain; and the presence of shared rules for interacting. We conclude that competition-based negotiations may lead to increased institutional capacity while also highlighting the challenges of housing delivery in the context of institutional uncertainty.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the debate on whether or not e-government has the transformational impact on government performance, governance, and public service, as we addressed this very issue at the 2007 ECEG. However, e-government research results on the transformational impact are mixed (Scholl 2005). This may be an apt reflection of either the early stages of e-government development or the newness of e-government research field or both. Our research goal as scholars of e-government must be to penetrate appearances to ascertain whatever lessons and meanings might lie beneath. This paper is an initial attempt toward achieving this goal. The main objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between public service reform through e-government and actual government performance. We achieve this objective through a case study of Japan's National Tax Agency (NTA) and its launch of transactional e-government initiative: "e-Tax" - an online income tax returns filing and payment service for individuals and corporations. A preliminary case analysis provides evidence in support of the transformational impact of e-Tax on NTA performance (e.g. tax administration efficiency gains) and public service (e.g. process reform). This paper makes an important contribution to the growing e-government research literature on the transformational impact of e-government particularly on service process reform.

Abstract: In October 2012, Australia's parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that a mediation support unit should be created within the Australian Agency for International Development, a department now amalgamated with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The question is: Does Australia possess the motivation and capacity to implement active and effective international mediation by building the capacity of intermediaries to deploy various peacemaking methods to hasten de-escalation at different stages of a conflict? If not, is a mediation support unit an appropriate initiative to address this capability gap? This article draws on quantitative conflict data sets and an expert panel to conclude that Australia's track record demonstrates significant capacity to undertake international mediation, but that the mediation personnel and processes available to government are insufficiently resourced and coordinated to readily provide policymakers with accessible tools to undertake the diverse range of mediation strategies advocated by conflict scholars. While a mediation support unit would address some of these issues, at present it conflicts with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's institutional philosophy based on diffused expertise.

Abstract: Classical organizational management literature draws clear parallels between organizational culture and climate and effective use of power and influence as key to successful policy implementation of reforms in public sector organizations. On the other hand, the public policy literature, in particular, policy transfer as a strand within policy studies, emphasizes the role of the national context, more specifically, 'facilitators' and 'constraints' of ''politico-administrative culture" within the national context, as crucial to understanding processes of transfer, convergence, and diffusion of public policy. There is a plethora of studies by Western scholars of public management who have successfully utilized these theoretical underpinnings to study the effectiveness of public service reforms in mature policy environments such as the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand, and others. However, the public policy and comparative public management literature only offers a limited number of case studies from developing, middle-/upper-middle countries, which rely on concepts of organizational management in addition to narratives on the impact of policy learning from global doctrines, such as Weberianism, New Public Management (NPM), and New Public Governance (NPG), and national politics, on the implementation of administrative reforms in those contexts. Kazakhstan, as a resource-affluent post-Soviet country and a bastion of modernization and 'open government' in Central Asia or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the post-Soviet era is a case in point. Based on ethnographic research consisting of interviews with elite academics, civil servants, and think-tank activists, as well as reviews of OECD and government strategy reports in Astana, the findings point to a potential abatement of the impact of context constraints such as large power distance and collectivist behavior by context facilitators such as those surrounding the use of 'trilingualism' and public diplomacy towards reforms in Kazakhstan particularly in recent years.

Abstract: Administrative staff are a crucial human capital input in tertiary education institutions. Given the substantial investment in recruitment and selection of administrative staff, efficient and effective use of these staff affects the organisational and financial performance of universities. Whereas much concern has been placed on the performance of academic staff, the ability of a university to obtain an optimal level of administrative staff has not been addressed. This paper investigates whether the usage capacity of administrative staff is maximised in Vietnamese universities. Vietnam has implemented several education reform policies with the aim to improve the standing of its universities in the world's education market. The process is not only about obtaining and delivering good education quality, but also efficiently using human resources to reach optimal performance and sustainable development. Employing the stochastic frontier input requirement model with data on 112 Vietnamese universities, we examine the presence of excess administrative capacity in these universities, given the existing student outputs and other input resources. We find that, on average, the level of excess administrative capacity is 3.4%, implying an economic loss in universities. In addition, under the analysis of determinants of the variances of the inefficiency effects and the error terms in the input-requirement function, our findings reveal that excess administrative capacity varies according to location and ownership. Some policy implications are discussed to address excess capacity of administrative staff in the Vietnamese context and some key lessons learned for the rest of the world.

Abstract: This article examines recent debate over core or 'independent' integrity institutions in the Victorian and Commonwealth governments to highlight some of the need, and potential, for more careful deliberation over options for building the capacity of integrity systems - the second of the analytical themes used in Australia's national assessment. The first part compares resourcing of major integrity institutions by Australian governments over the past 15 years. Staffing and finances are seen as a useful basic measure of capacity, helping lift attention away from the assumption that creation of new bodies necessarily increases capacity. The data also show that some jurisdictions-including Victoria-may yet have some way to go if they wish to match other governments. The second part of the analysis identifies eight further issues for consideration in deliberations on institutional design. Our conclusion is that by working through such issues more systematically, it may be possible to identify new or different institutional options for configuring integrity resources. This could help avoid inappropriate choices-whether unnecessary new bodies, overloads on existing ones or the import of frameworks that do not necessarily 'fit' local conditions-of particular relevance to current proposals for a new Commonwealth anti-corruption agency.

Abstract: This research investigates the value of teaching philosophies (TP) for today's academics and their institutions. It offers a new framework to enhance academic development, personal resilience, and institutional capacity building. Since the 1990s, TPs have been formalised as personally constructed and reflectively written statements of educational values, beliefs, and practices. Whereas within universities, TPs have been institutionalised for academic performance reviews, awards, and promotions. In-depth personal interviews on TPs and their value on personal journeys and institutional experiences were conducted with academics from Australia and Canada. The findings highlight the value and future potential of TPs beyond a formulaic role.

Abstract: Upgrading is among the most effective interventions to address urban poverty, but weaknesses include outdated conceptual frameworks informing project design, and ineffective management by governance institutions. This paper examines the ingredients that need to be put in place during upgrading to ensure the continuity of the settlement improvement process. The paper is divided into three sections. The first section introduces urban upgrading, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The second section then describes the growth of Barangay Commonwealth in Metro Manila and the characteristics of the settlement. The following section introduces the institutional capacity building framework, outlining the activities necessary to ensure longer-term improvement of low-income settlements. The section then examines physical, environmental, social, economic and institutional dimensions of the upgrading of the settlement that have taken place over the last 75 years. The concluding section examines areas that need attention in order to continue the process of building the institutional capacity that will ensure the longer-teen continuity of the improvement of Barangay Commonwealth.

Abstract: The lack of studies that examined the influence of government effectiveness on environmental pollution and whether it formulates the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis motivated this research. Therefore, this research examines the role of government effectiveness on CO2 emission in 170 countries. To achieve the research aims, the system generalized method of moment model is applied while categorizing the countries into three groups: namely high, moderate, and low government effectiveness countries. The major results of this research revealed that government effectiveness reduces CO2 emission significantly in the overall sample, high and the moderate government effectiveness countries while it is not significant in the low government effectiveness countries. Moreover, the EKC hypothesis is present in the overall sample high and moderate government effectiveness countries while the hypothesis does not exist in the low government effectiveness countries. Therefore, the outcome of this research shows clearly that effectiveness of the government in terms of independence from political pressures, the quality of policy preparation and application, and the reliability of the government's commitment to such policies is an important element that determines the EKC hypothesis. From the outcome of this research, a number of policy implications were provided for the investigated countries.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited a wide range of national responses with an even wider range of outcomes in terms of infections and mortalities. Australia is a rare success story, keeping deaths comparatively low, and infections too, until the Omicron wave. What explains Australia's success? Typical explanations emphasise leaders' choices. We agree, but argue that leaders' choices, and whether these are implemented effectively, is shaped by the legacy of state transformation. Decades of neo-liberal reforms have hollowed out state capacity and confused lines of control and accountability, leaving Australia unprepared for the pandemic. Leaders thus abandoned plans and turned to ad hoc, simple to implement emergency measures - border closures and lockdowns. These averted large-scale outbreaks and deaths, but with diminishing returns as the Delta variant took hold. Conversely, Australia's regulatory state has struggled to deliver more sophisticated policy responses, even when leaders were apparently committed, including an effective quarantine system, crucial for border controls, and vaccination programme, essential for exiting the quagmire of lockdowns and closed borders, leading to a partial return to top-down governing. The Australian experience shows that to avoid a public health catastrophe or more damaging lockdowns in the next pandemic, states must re-learn to govern.

Abstract: Previous studies find that adopting Freedom of Information (FOI) laws increase reporting of corruption, as this facilitates the right of access to governmental information. Thus, it is argued that FOI laws increase transparency and enhance government accountability. However, whether or not adopting such transparency laws improves bureaucratic efficiency remains unexplored. We provide first quantitative evidence on the impact of FOI laws on bureaucratic efficiency. Using panel data on 132 countries from 1990 to 2011, we find that adopting FOI laws, and in particular 'stronger' FOI laws, is associated with an improvement in bureaucratic efficiency, after controlling for self-section bias. FOI laws appear to be more effective in the long run, and if combined with a higher degree of media freedom, presence of non-governmental organization activism, and political competition. These findings are robust to controlling for endogeneity using instrumental variables, alternative samples, and estimation methods.

Abstract: Building a national system of social governance (guojia zhili tixi), which is the long-running governance dream of Xi Jinping, has triggered the creation of China's 'smart state' using the tools of new information technologies to advance governance capacity (zhili nengli). These systems were already deployed nationally when the COVID-19 pandemic hit China, but were connected at a lesser capacity, targeting specific domains of security, industry or government administration. In response to the crisis, multiple technologies have been merged, exceeding the scope of their originally intended functions. This is known as function creep, when surveillant technologies remain functional past achievement of their intended purpose, or surveillant assemblages, where multiple surveillant technologies are combined. As more countries turn to digitalisation to increase public security and intensify social and market governance, the expansion of surveillant functions in China and their now-palpable effects on people's lives raises new and pressing questions for scholars and decision-makers alike.

Abstract: The national-level data extracted from the World Bank, Transparency International, and the United Nations databases were analysed in this study to examine the contribution of e-participation in improving governance factors through its influence on corruption, voice and accountability, and government effectiveness. The analysis has provided a mixed outcome in improving governance through e-participation, showing a significant relationship between e-participation and corruption-perception, and government effectiveness. Meanwhile, the relationships between e-participation and voice and accountability are insignificant. This finding indicates that the present form of e-participation in ensuring citizens' voices for holding service providers accountable may have some limitations. The findings have implications for international organisations and government institutions to redesign their e-participation methods and tools to warrant citizens' voice and ensure accountability of service providers at the national level.

Abstract: The last decade has seen increasing attention to institutional arrangements and policy outcomes affecting the governance of the world's seas and oceans. Governance is linked to institutional capacity and to the effectiveness of public organizations drawing attention to tools and approaches underpinning effective and efficient institutional arrangements. Australia has taken a high profile in oceans governance, with international actions matched by the development of a number of national initiatives including a national Oceans Policy. Australia has numerous laws and policy instruments addressing aspects of the management of the marine environment, reflecting the federal nature of this policy area where responsibility is shared between the Commonwealth (federal or Australian) government and Australian state and territory governments. The Oceans Policy, implemented by the Commonwealth and applied within Commonwealth jurisdiction, has been a major initiative but its implementation highlights a number of challenges. This article outlines Australia's approach to ocean governance and assesses, through reference to the concept of effectiveness, current governance arrangements integral to the Oceans Policy.

Abstract: This paper examines an attempt to build capacity and empower local institutions in war-torn Jaffna,, on the northern tip of Sri Lanka. A participatory approach that is aimed at social empowerment is seen to be possible even under the most restrictive of political environments. However, whether or not the development intervention provides a foundation for longer-term improvement depends on the extent to which institutional capacity is built. Through an examination of the Jaffna Reconstruction Project, it is argued that if any of the ingredients of this institutional capacity are missing, not only will the 'islands of participation and empowerment' that are built by the development initiative be short-lived, but there may also be a negligible contribution to building a foundation for longer-term improvement in quality of life.

Abstract: Purpose The "resource curse phenomenon" has received a lot of attention from researchers; however, there has not been any sound explanation to back this phenomenon since the main reason why natural resource should restrain economic growth instead of boosting economic growth remains unanswered. This paper contributes to literature on "resource curse hypothesis" by examining the role of government effectiveness in influencing the impact of gas resource rent on economic growth. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted the Cobb-Douglass production and incorporated gas resource rent, institutional quality (government effectiveness), inflation and exchange rate as additional variables that influences total output (gross domestic product). The author estimated the empirical form of the Cobb-Douglass production using autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) and Toda and Yamamoto (1995) as the main estimation strategies while other time series approaches were used as a robustness check. Findings The estimates from the ARDL short-run and the long-run dynamics suggest that the direct impact of gas resource rent on economic growth was positive but not statistically significant. At the same time, the interacting of gas resource rent and government effectiveness showed a positive and statistically significant effect of nearly 0.4123 and 0.8724 on economic growth in the long run and short run, respectively. The results from the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) also indicated that economic growth has a strong influence on gas resource rent while government effectiveness drives economic growth and not vice versa. Research limitations/implications The findings from this study imply that government effectiveness plays a crucial role in averting the "resource curse phenomenon". Hence, improving government effectiveness and efficiency through minimizing corruption among state institutions would be imperative in curbing the "resource curse phenomenon" in developing countries. Originality/value The influential role of government effectiveness on the relationship between gas resource rent on economic growth is examined.

Abstract: We develop a state capacity framework to account for different national responses to Covid-19. Our starting point is the influential idea that neoliberalism has a major role to play in state failure to control the pandemic. By implementing neoliberal reforms, states have ostensibly rendered themselves incapable of preventing or mitigating the viral outbreak. A focus on the British experience lends weight to this perspective. But when viewed in a comparative light, the picture is less straightforward. By comparing the British and Australian cases, we see a similar embrace of neoliberal reforms across the whole of government, yet with strikingly divergent outcomes. How can we account for this dramatic difference? To answer this question, we offer an enhanced state capacity framework to improve our understanding of diverse national responses to Covid-19. Our larger objective is to enrich the existing state capacity literature in two ways. First, we extend the existing state capacity framework by introducing a new category - salutary capacity - to encapsulate a state's ability to correct and counteract the course of a national health emergency. Second, we introduce the idea of political choice to emphasise the importance of agency in offsetting the institutional weaknesses associated with neoliberal reform.

Abstract: Electricity is a vital factor underlying modern living standards, but there are many developing countries with low levels of electricity access and use. We seek to systematically identify the crucial elements underlying transitions toward greater electrification in developing countries. We use a cross-sectional regression approach with national-level data up to 2012 for 135 low-and middle-income countries. The paper finds that the effectiveness of governments is the most important governance attribute for encouraging the transition to increased electrification in developing countries, on average. The results add to the growing evidence on the importance of governance for development outcomes. Donors seeking to make more successful contributions to electrification may wish to target countries with more effective governments.

We analyse six types of redistribution in urban areas, and find that effect variations in urban wage inequality arise depending on the specific recipients of redistribution. Notably, under redistribution to urban unskilled labour, changes in wage inequality will depend on the capital intensity of the urban skilled sector when state capacity increases.

Abstract: We study the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization in a federation. Regional governments are characterized by their abilities to deliver public goods (administrative capacity) and to raise tax revenues (fiscal capacity). Two regimes are compared on efficiency grounds. Under partial decentralization, regional governments rely on central bailouts to complete local projects in financing needs. Under full decentralization, marginal financing is achieved via local capital taxes. We show that the presence of sufficiently low levels of administrative capacity is a necessary condition for full decentralization dominance. This condition may also be sufficient, depending on the projects' characteristics. Some extensions are presented.

Abstract: This paper reports the results of an empirical investigation into the relationships between public social spending, government effectiveness, and economic growth. Using panel data covering 132 developed and developing countries over the 2008 to 2019 period, we find significant and complementary relationships among the variables through fixed effects, system GMM, and instrumental variable estimation. All three components of public social spending, including social security benefits, education expenditure, and health expenditure, have a significant and positive impact on subsequent economic growth. Government effectiveness has a direct growth-enhancing effect as well as a mediating and positive effect on the association between public social expenditures and economic growth. Thus, governments accelerate the positive impact of public social spending on economic growth. These relationships hold for countries at all income levels, while the channels predicting a positive social spending - growth relationship are stronger in high-income countries than lower-income countries. To stimulate inclusive growth, governments must actively design and implement social spending policies. These, however, should be complemented by concomitant efforts to strengthen the quality of public institutions, which exerts a substantial impact on the social spending - growth relationship.

Abstract: Recognising both the importance of intertidal wetlands and their role in mosquito-borne disease we discuss wise management to conserve wetland values and to reduce vector borne disease health risks. First we summarise the mosquito-borne diseases associated with intertidal wetlands in sub-tropical and tropical Australia. We consider the Ramsar Strategic Plan, its reflection in some key Australian statutes and the relationship between environment-focussed legislation and health legislation. This is followed by a brief overview of mosquito control and its impact on human health. Using a salt marsh example of an integrated process, we describe the development of what was, in the 1980s in Australia, a novel method of habitat modification (runnelling) for mosquito control. Runnelling modifies the tidal water flow on salt marshes, reducing mosquito larval numbers and minimising environmental impacts. The approach is related to two of the Ramsar goals (wise use and institutional capacity and effectiveness). We then describe the extension of its rationale to a complex mangrove system. Finally, with a concept model, we consider the convergence between minimal habitat modification for wetland conservation and human health protection using an interdisicplinary approach involving multiple stakeholders.

Abstract: Carbon neutrality is a 21st-century priority area, with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries making significant investments in renewable energy and climate mitigation initiatives to attain it. However, carbon neutrality research in the MENA region is under-developed, particularly when considering the roles of renewable energy, economic growth, and effectiveness of government. To address this gap, this research investigates the roles of renewable energy, economic growth, and government effectiveness toward the MENA region's carbon neutrality goal. We implemented heterogeneous and second-generation panel data techniques that are resilient to cross-sectional dependency and slope heterogeneity to panel data spanning 16 MENA countries from 1996 to 2018. We discovered that MENA data are cross-sectionally dependent, heterogeneous, and cointegrated. We found that government effectiveness and renewable energy bring carbon neutrality closer, but economic growth initially delays it. We detected Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in the MENA region, specifically in the High-Income Countries. Although there were signs of EKC in the Middle-Income Countries, this was not significantly validated. Finally, we found a one-way causal link from government effectiveness and renewable energy to carbon neutrality but a feedback mechanism between economic growth and carbon neutrality in the MENA region. As a result of these findings, it is recommended that the MENA region's policymakers prioritize renewable energies and improve the effectiveness of government to drive economic growth toward the carbon neutrality goal.

Abstract: Using an index of corporate governance quality (CGQ), we provide the first robust evidence of the determinants of stock liquidity in Australia. We assume that CGQ affects stock liquidity because effective governance decreases information asymmetries between insiders (e.g. managers) and outsiders (e.g. investors), as well as among outsiders, by improving information transparency of a firm. Consistent with agency theory, this study, using 435 large capitalization firms over the period from 2001 to 2008, finds a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have a higher level of stock liquidity. These findings are robust to alternative proxies of CGQ, stock liquidity and endogeneity bias.

Abstract: This article examines policy capacity in the context of Australian health authorities in relation to the challenges confronting policy workers and senior managers in these agencies. The article reports the challenges identified by our informants in relation to political structures, roles and responsibilities of other portfolios and governments, interactions between policy officials and with the minister and the minister's office, whole of government policy approaches, stakeholder and public demands and expectations, and media pressures. The experience of these senior managers and policy workers is then reinterpreted in terms of a nodal governance model. The findings from the Australian study on policy capacity, interpreted in the context of nodal governance, is then used to discuss the features of "governance capacity" as articulated in the matrix model of policy capacity developed by Wu, Ramesh and Howlett (2015). The article concludes with propositions for strengthening policy capacity across the governance regime so depicted. These include: capacity building for individuals at various key locations in the network; organisational capacity building within the organisations and across their key relationships; and reforms across the governance network as a whole.

This exploratory article begins this process by reporting data from 100 successfully prosecuted cases from New York City. The article analyzes data on varying degrees of corruption in service provision in New York City. The loss to the city is much more a loss of governance capacity than it is a monetary loss.

Abstract: Background: Evidence-informed decision-making for health is far from the norm, particularly in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Health policy and systems research (HPSR) has an important role in providing the context-sensitive and -relevant evidence that is needed. However, there remain significant challenges both on the supply side, in terms of capacity for generation of policy-relevant knowledge such as HPSR, and on the demand side in terms of the demand for and use of evidence for policy decisions. This paper brings together elements from both sides to analyse institutional capacity for the generation of HPSR and the use of evidence (including HPSR) more broadly in LMICs. Methods: The paper uses literature review methods and two survey instruments (directed at research institutions and Ministries of Health, respectively) to explore the types of institutional support required to enhance the generation and use of evidence. Results: Findings from the survey of research institutions identified the absence of core funding, the lack of definitional clarity and academic incentive structures for HPSR as significant constraints. On the other hand, the survey of Ministries of Health identified a lack of locally relevant evidence, poor presentation of research findings and low institutional prioritisation of evidence use as significant constraints to evidence uptake. In contrast, improved communication between researchers and decision-makers and increased availability of relevant evidence were identified as facilitators of evidence uptake. Conclusion: The findings make a case for institutional arrangements in research that provide support for career development, collaboration and cross-learning for researchers, as well as the setting up of institutional arrangements and processes to incentivise the use of evidence among Ministries of Health and other decision-making institutions. The paper ends with a series of recommendations to build institutional capacity in HPSR through engaging multiple stakeholders in identifying and maintaining incentive structures, improving research (including HPSR) training, and developing stronger tools for synthesising non-traditional forms of local, policy-relevant evidence such as grey literature. Addressing challenges on both the supply and demand side can build institutional capacity in the research and policy worlds and support the enhanced uptake of high quality evidence in policy decisions.

Abstract: PurposeAgeing is a global concern that poses many challenges for governments, particularly in relation to the pressing issue of how to provide adequate social protection for the increasing number of elderly. Alongside rapid social and demographic transformation, Indonesia is especially challenged by the increasing number of elderly in need of formal care that is stretching the capacities of government and necessitates improvements in the social protection system. This study examines governance capacity in nursing homes and offers recommendations for improving the social protection system.Design/methodology/approachThe research presents a qualitative case study of government aged care centres in East Java and the experiences of residents and staff of three centres managed by the Provincial Social Service of East Java. The case study is based on ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured interviews with 32 informants comprising directors, managers, staff and elderly residents of nursing homes.FindingsThe research finds that while social protection is in place, governance capacities at the provincial and local level are thinly stretched. The research highlights the tensions between existent governance capacities - in terms of mobility, decision-making, implementation and established local structures of governance and management - and the inability to meet the increasing demands for government elder care services and resources amidst broader societal transformations such as shifts in cultural framing of familial care of elderly. The findings point to the importance of understanding the dynamic relationship between governance capacity and the shifting terrains of elderly care due to societal transformation.Originality/valueThe research brings attention to the pivotal role that governance capacity plays in shaping the experiences and challenges of local government level elder care provision and the growing need for elder care in the face of an ageing population and shifts in kinship and family elder care arrangements. Elder care is not simply about addressing basic needs but also the quality and dignity of elderly and this is not easy to address where social protection systems are stretched beyond capacity. Recommendations are provided for enhancing government policy and expanding the scope for building cross-sectorial partnerships.

Abstract: Global and national strategy emphasises land use planning as a key mechanism for disaster risk reduction (DRR). The practice of planning for natural hazards is devolved to local levels, making the capacity of local government critical for achieving strategic DRR goals. This study assessed the capacity of local governments in Australia to plan for natural hazards. Many Local Government Areas (LGAs) had satisfactory or good hazard planning provision, but remoteness, land area and council size influence poor hazard planning provision. Strategic intent for land use planning as a DRR mechanism is unlikely to be successful in many LGAs without first addressing place-based capacity constraints on hazard planning.

Abstract: Given the increasing importance attached to both corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate governance, this study investigates the association between these two complimentary mechanisms used by companies to enhance relations with stakeholders. Consistent with both legitimacy and stakeholder theory and controlling for industry profile, firm size, stockholder power/dispersion, creditor power/leverage, and economic performance, our analysis of the annual reports for a sample of 222 listed companies suggests that firms providing more CSR information: have better corporate governance ratings; are larger; belong to higher profile industries; and are more highly leveraged. Our findings support the limited prior research suggesting a link between corporate governance quality and CSR disclosure in company annual reports and suggest that, rather than mandating specific disclosures, regulators might be better served focussing on corporate governance quality as a way of increasing CSR disclosures.

Abstract: Ecological modernisation (EM), in theory and practice, has increasingly become central to contemporary state environmental reform agendas. EM's allure lies in its central tenet that the contemporary institutions of capitalism can be ecologically adapted to achieve 'win-win' economic and environmental outcomes. How government policy can best accomplish this aim is contested, however, with weak and strong EM approaches advocating different roles for the state in facilitating ecological restructuring. The latter approaches argue that for EM processes to be successful, state intervention via ecological industrial policy is required. This article makes a unique contribution to the industry policy and EM debate by assessing the manner in which EM was conceptualised and implemented within the Australian government's automotive industry policy between 2007 and 2013. This analysis raises issues about the institutional capacity of states to pursue either weak or strong forms of EM.

Abstract: This paper presents new archival evidence about the amount and structure of central government disaster relief during China's devastating flood of 1823. The flood affected 20 per cent of China's counties, and spending per capita was sizable and distributed between provinces depending on the intensity of flooding. Because of its relative small size and limited state capacity, the Chinese government ultimately spent about half of its annual tax revenues on relief during 1823. Given China's ensuing secular economic stagnation, this is consistent with models emphasising state capacity for economic growth.

Abstract: In the post-Cold War era, a voluminous literature has developed to define failed states, identify the causes and parameters of failure, and devise ways for dealing with the problems associated with state fragility and failure. While there is some theoretical diversity within this literature-notably between neoliberal institutionalists and neo-Weberian institutionalists-state failure is commonly defined in terms of state capacity. Since capacity is conceived in technical and 'objective' terms, the political nature of projects of state construction (and reconstruction) is masked. Whereas the existence of social and political struggles of various types is often recognized by the failed states literature, these conflicts are abstracted from political and social institutions. Such an analysis then extends into programmes that attempt to build state capacity as part of projects that seek to manage social and political conflict. Ascertaining which interests are involved and which interests are left out in such processes is essential for any understanding of the prospects or otherwise of conflict resolution.

Abstract: This paper extends prior research on the relationship between governance quality and auditor remuneration. We examine the influence of audit committee effectiveness (ACE), a proxy for governance quality, on audit fees (AF) and non-audit services fees (NASF) using a new composite measure comprising audit committee independence, expertise, diligence and size. We find that after controlling for board of director characteristics, there is a significant positive association between ACE and AF only for larger clients. Our results indicate that effective audit committees undertake more monitoring which results in wider audit scope and higher audit fees. Contrary to our expectations, we find the association between ACE and NASF to be positive and significant, especially for larger clients. This suggests that larger clients are more likely to purchase non-audit services (NAS) even in the presence of effective audit committees probably due to the complexity of their activities. Overall, our findings support regulatory initiatives aimed at improving corporate governance quality.

Abstract: 'Twinning' is the distinctive method employed during the last two decades by the Swedish International Development Go-operation Agency (Sida) to promote institutional capacity building in development co-operation. This article reports on a study undertaken to provide evidence which would help Sida to make judgements about the efficacy of the twinning model as a basis for sustainable capacity building, and to explore ways of enhancing the method. The study indicates that the twinning method has potential advantages over other modes of development co-operation, particularly that it offers enhanced possibilities for organizational learning and sustainable capacity building. However, the study suggests that this potential is not being fully exploited. Twinning arrangements have produced major benefits in professional/technical upgrading, but there is less evidence of outcomes at the level of sustainable institutional capacity building. Contrary to Sida's expectations of its distinctive advantages, in operation, twinning tends to become a rather routine process, viewed by developing country partners as an unexceptional way of delivering aid which presents few fundamental challenges and provides essentially the same benefits as alternative methods. It appears that institutional development and organizational learning are generally not issues of major significance for partner organizations in twinning arrangements. Even at the individual level the focus is on training rather than learning, which results in the usual emphasis on formal off-job training rather than seeking opportunities for learning from work. The article presents ideas on how the current twinning approach might be renovated, and considers how agencies such as Sida might enhance their development co-operation in the realm of governance by moving beyond twinning.

Abstract: We compare Australian and New Zealand parliamentary demands on executive governments to 'do something' about globalisation, noting that parliaments are distinctive institutionally-functioning as umbrellas protecting arenas of adversarial competitiveness, with little scope for cohesive institutional capacity. We define 'globalisation' as it is defined by the parliamentary actors themselves: that is, quite broadly with different actors taking different postures towards globalisation depending on party and on political and institutional perspectives. Whether parliaments can respond effectively to globalisation depends on their institutional capacity and political composition-their political resources. We establish the international context in which the two parliaments operate, establishing our hypotheses about institutional capacity from Lisa Martin's book Democratic Commitments: Legislatures and International Cooperation. We conclude that both parliaments have made significant, if often unnoticed, contributions to the political management of globalisation.

Abstract: This paper explores sovereign risk preferences against direct and indirect natural disasters losses in industrialized countries. Using Australia as a case study, the analysis compares expected disaster losses and government capacity to finance losses. Utilizing a national disaster loss dataset, extreme value theory is applied to estimate an all-hazard annual loss distribution. Unusually but critically, the dataset includes direct as well as indirect losses, allowing for the analysis to consider the oft-ignored issue of indirect losses. Expected annual losses (direct, and direct plus indirect) are overlaid with a risk-layer approach, to distinguish low, medium and extreme loss events. Each risk layer is compared to available fiscal resources for financing losses, grounded in the political reality of Australian disaster financing. When considering direct losses only, we find support for a risk-neutral preference on the part of the Australian government for low and medium loss levels, and a risk-averse preference in regard to extreme losses. When indirect losses are also estimated, we find that even medium loss levels are expected to overwhelm available fiscal resources, thereby violating the available resources assumption underlying arguments for sovereign risk neutrality. Our analysis provides empirical support for the assertion that indirect losses are a major, under-recognised concern for industrialized countries. A risk-averse preference in regard to medium and extreme loss events recommends enhanced investment in both corrective and prospective risk reduction in relation to these risks level, in particular to reduce indirect losses.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of corporate governance quality on audit quality in Malaysia. The sampling frame is 457 Malaysian non-finance listed companies, over the periods 2003 to 2007 (pre-2007 Code period) and 2008 to 2012 (post-2007 Code period), consisting of 2,285 observations for each period. This study uses pooled ordinary least square (OLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. The results show that the effectiveness of the audit committee (AC) has no significant influence on audit fees in the pre-and post-2007 Code period, and the effectiveness of the board has no significant influence on audit fees in the pre-2007 Code period, although it has significant influence on audit fees in the post-2007 Code period. The results suggest that the existing corporate governance framework in relation to AC has limitation in its governance role on audit process. Our study contributes to existing literature conducted in the US, the UK and Australia where their institutional settings are different from that of Malaysia. In addition, our study is based on the 2007 Code's recommendation which contributes to the previous research conducted in Malaysia and provides an insightful evidence to the regulator on the corporate governance regime in Malaysia.

Abstract: To generate innovative solutions for marine sustainability challenges, scientists, policymakers, and funders are increasingly calling for interdisciplinary research that transcends disciplinary boundaries. However, challenges associated with doing interdisciplinary research persist and undermine progress toward tackling the complex challenges faced by marine social-ecological systems. One barrier for engaging in effective interdisciplinary research is a lack of understanding about the institutional capacities that support interdisciplinary knowledge production. Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with members of the Centre for Marine Socioecology in Australia, we identify five principles that underpin effective interdisciplinary research organizations. The principles are: (1) support female leadership; (2) forge partnerships outside of academia; (3) develop impact-based performance metrics; (4) focus on long-term funding; and (5) cultivate a visible brand. Going forward, these principles could be used to inform organizational design that transforms institutional barriers into enablers of innovative interdisciplinary research for more sustainable, desirable, and equitable futures.

Abstract: Since World War Two, the role of non-profit think tanks in the United States has grown and diversified. Today, the United States' government and Congress is advised on many matters of policy-making and implementation by such think tanks. The Westminster system of parliament, as practised in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, has rarely provided a fertile ground for the creation and sustained existence of such privately operated institutions. Despite limited links with similar United States' organizations, the seeds have never really flourished outside the United States of America. Australian Commonwealth governments have been most antagonistic in this regard. On the other hand, management consulting companies, many of which have headquarters in the United States, lobbyists, and corporate representation flourish in the quasi-corporatist political environment carefully constructed by the Australian Labor party (ALP) government since 1983. Policy-related research divisions and statutory authorities have likewise grown in size and importance within the departmental agencies of government itself. Energy, agriculture, immigration, and social service research ''arms'' have been encouraged within the ministerial arena of policy analysis and advice. Especially important has been micro and macro-economic research, urban and infrastructural planning, the Industry Commission, and the Bureau of Industry Economics, respectively. This paper will analyse the growth of these specialized forms of government think tanks, study the range of their ministerial advice, and speculate about their changing role in an increasingly ''managerialist'' type of Westminster-style parliamentary setting.

Abstract: The paper re-examines the role of the state in economic change in colonial India (1757-1947), by paying attention to fiscal capacity. This capacity was larger than that of the precolonial states, and based on different foundations, such as centralisation of finance and securitisation of public debt. Nevertheless, the effort to raise finance hit a barrier, which had owed to the separation of debt from revenue operations. Did the barrier matter? By keeping markets open, the colonial state served private enterprise, but its failure to sustain growth in fiscal capacity compromised public investment in infrastructure and social development.

Abstract: It is often claimed that proportional representation (PR) undermines government effectiveness, including decisional efficacy, fiscal prudence, electoral responsiveness and accountability. Drawing on New Zealand's experience since the introduction of a mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system in 1996, this article examines the impact of the new voting system on government effectiveness. Although government durability has been substantially reduced and the policy-making process has become more complex, governments under MMP appear to be no less able to address major policy problems or respond to changing economic circumstances. Moreover, New Zealand has maintained continuous fiscal surpluses under MMP - a radical departure from the protracted, and often large, deficits that characterised the previous two decades under a majoritarian electoral system.

Abstract: We examine the effect of stock liquidity and corporate governance on the firm's leverage decision in the order-driven stock trading system and less stringent governance environment of Australia. Using a sample of 1207 non-financial firms from 2001 to 2013, resulting in 9855 firm-year observations, we find the posited negative stock liquidity-leverage relation, confirming prior research observations that firms with more liquid stocks are significantly less leveraged. We also find a significant and negative relation between corporate governance quality (CGQ) and leverage, indicating that firms with high CGQ significantly reduce leverage. In a closer analysis, we find that the significantly negative CGQ-leverage relation exists only for firms with high stock liquidity and does not exist for firms with low stock liquidity. Our study is the first to examine such an interactive relationship among stock liquidity, corporate governance and leverage. The results, which are robust to a range of alternative proxies and to additional tests, provide new insights into the determinants of leverage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: As cities confront increasingly complex governance problems, conceptions of urban governance are becoming progressively more receptive to grasping its dynamic and multiplex nature, its connection to multiple lines of authority and forms of power, and the socio-material assemblages through which it works. Yet, despite conceptual advances around the dynamism and heterogeneity of urban governing assemblages and their durability, much remains to be understood about the processes and devices that compose and cohere their constituent elements to generate governance capacity. We explore this limitation by deploying Foucault's concept of 'dispositif' to analytically characterize how urban governance capacity is achieved around complex urban problems via processes and devices of composition and cohering. We do so by examining an emergent urban energy governance dispositif focused around top-tier commercial office space in Sydney, Australia: a key site around which multiple elements have been composed in a complex, entangled dispositif to produce effective urban governance capacity and accomplish substantive gains in office building energy performance. We characterise the socio-material elements involved and, more particularly, identify and analyse the processes and devices that compose the dispositif and cohere its governance capacity and we draw out the diverse forms of power that are immanent in these processes. These are, we argue, key steps in refining systematic understandings of the contemporary functioning and politics of the distributed urban governance of complex urban challenges. We conclude with key observations suggested by our analysis for urban governance scholarship.

Abstract: As transnational programs are often advocated as a knowledge transfer opportunity between the partner universities, this case study investigated the knowledge transfer (KT) processes between Indonesian and Australian universities through an undergraduate transnational program partnership (TPP). An inter-organisational KT theoretical framework from the business sector was adapted and used to guide the study. The data were generated through semi-structured interviews with key university officers and document analysis from two partner universities. Based on the thematic analysis of the data, the findings demonstrated that the curriculum mapping process facilitated KT. However, different intentions of the partner universities in establishing the program led to declining interest to conduct more KT when expectations were not met. The Indonesian university's existing knowledge, acquired from other sources through processes that were serendipitous and based on individual lecturers' personal experience, meant that KT opportunities through the TPP were not always pursued despite written agreement to exchange knowledge with the Australian partner. While KT most evidently resulted in institutional capacity development for the Indonesian university's school that managed the TPP, dissemination of knowledge to other units within the university was more challenging due to communication problems between the units. Hence, other universities seeking to conduct KT through TPPs need to understand each partner university's intention in establishing the partnerships, identify the institutions' needs before seeking knowledge input from the partner university and improve the communication between and within the universities for sustainable benefits.

Abstract: We investigate whether and if so, how, corporate governance 'quality'(1) is related to the information flows from a company and how the share market and its agents respond. Specifically, we study links between the 'quality' of a firm's corporate governance (CGQ) and the informativeness of its disclosures. We employ six indicators of informativeness. They include document counts, properties of analysts' forecasts and a 'timeliness' metric, in the spirit of Ball and Brown (1968), that reflects the average speed of price discovery throughout the year. Our results suggest the answer to our question is 'Yes': better-governed firms do make more informative disclosures.

Attempts to manage these challenges commonly occur through a 'governance' approach involving partnership and hybrid arrangements between a whole host of stakeholders from the corporate, state and community sectors. As the closest tier of government to the local level, local government has found itself playing a central role in mining governance, particularly in responding to and managing community concerns. This paper examines the role of, and challenges facing, local government in managing the impacts of mining both alone and in collaboration with other governmental actors. It documents these issues as they relate to the resource needs, planning strategies, human capital impacts, service provision and institutional capacity of local governments in some of the most mining-intensive regions in Australia.

Abstract: In many cases, when governments commit themselves to green policy targets, they also imply the development of 'green' industries to reach those targets. But, how do governments foster the development of such industries? This is particularly relevant because such industries are often in a very early stage of their evolution. Taking the case of organic farming, we argue that the state's ability to foster 'policy capacity' is critical to the emerging development trajectories of such industries. Focussing on the state's ability to generate policy capacity in the Danish and Australian organic food sector, this article suggests that policy capacity develops as a result of high levels of state and associative capacity and the ability to create conditions favourable for corporatist deliberation. The comparative study undertaken demonstrates that these conditions are met in the Danish case, resulting in a high level of policy capacity. By contrast, Australia suffers from a low level of policy capacity as a result of low state and associative capacity and lack of corporatist deliberation.

Abstract: Transitions management (TM) is emerging as an approach to governing complex sustainability problems. Critiques point to the need to understand dynamics of system change, particularly, with regard to actor agency at micro and meso scales. This paper begins to address this scholarly gap by first, developing an analytical framework of the institutional context of a transition that recognizes forms of agency. Second, a method to apply the framework to empirical cases of urban water socio-technical systems to map their institutional context is developed. The results revealed: i) ways to identify problematic features of current systems and underlying cognitive and normative frames, to assist with envisioning and transition pathway development, ii) a method of system analysis that can target leverage points for strategizing transitions agendas and experiments, and iii) a dynamic description of the system to assist with evaluating TM interventions and monitoring transitions. By providing a systems analysis cognizant of contextual dynamics and targeted to the knowledge needs of TM activities, this analytical tool shows promise for improving TM through further empirical application and research.

Abstract: Using an online panel, we surveyed a representative sample of 500 each in Australia and New Zealand during July 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. We find trust in government has increased dramatically, with around 80% of respondents agreeing government was generally trustworthy. Around three quarters agreed management of the pandemic had increased their trust in government. Over 85% of respondents have confidence that public health scientists work in the public interest. Testing four hypotheses, we find that income and education predict trust in government and confidence in public health scientists, as does voting for the political party in government. Trust in government and confidence in public health scientists strongly predict Covid-19 phone application use, largely through convincing people the App is beneficial. Trust in government then is both an outcome and antecedent of government effectiveness. Building trust is important for governments implementing difficult policy responses during a crisis.

Abstract: Australian local government does not enjoy the status of its counterparts in comparable democracies and has long sought acknowledgment in the federal constitution. As these campaigns have consistently failed, this study considers how, and in which forms, local government obtains its own political legitimacy within a governance system centered on the citizen-state relationship, in addition to evaluating the relationships between the different forms of legitimacy. We find that positive perceptions of local government effectiveness are associated with higher levels of support for constitutional change, but that local governments need to pay more attention to systems of accountability and oversight, how building and planning issues are handled, and how they communicate with residents. Generally, and unsurprisingly, local government is appreciated more by those who rely on their services yet who are not always the loudest voices in public debates. Constitutional legitimacy is more likely when other sources of legitimacy are enhanced.

Abstract: In order to deepen understanding of path dependence in urban transport, this article presents a case study of urban passenger transport institutions in Melbourne, Australia over 50 years. The institutional capacity of the roads and public transport sectors are explored separately and the trends are then compared and contrasted. The main components of the analysis are: structural changes to the organisations, participation on planning committees, access to financial resources, accountability frameworks, membership of forums and relationships with other actors. The conclusion is that, whilst the historical picture is complex, the trend is a strengthening of road planning institutions, and weakening public transport planning. This situation appears to be out of alignment with current needs. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Drawing on a systematic review of the literature, this paper explores the factors which have enabled and/or constrained the transformative potential of public service user participation within the five most influential recent narratives of public service reform. It argues that these narratives have failed either to offer a holistic conceptualisation of such participation in theory or to achieve its enactment in practice for four main reasons: participation is framed as polemic, with limited evidence of efficacy; public service delivery has been conceptualised as a linear process, with participation at its margins; structural changes have been insufficient in embedding participation; and power asymmetries have been reinforced through successive reforms. To combat these long-standing challenges, a value-creation approach is presented, which starts from an assumption of participation as a defining feature of public service delivery and considered how its import can be maximised to create value for individuals and society.

Abstract: The purpose of this article was to explore the impacts of climate change on human health in Australia in general, and the state of Queensland in particular. We evaluated healthrelated services and adaptation challenges in the health sector and indicate possible remedies. The scientific consensus on the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is convincing. Climate change will have potentially devastating human health effects including increased morbidity, mortality and injury in the near future. Its impacts will be unevenly distributed among geographical regions and population groups. The elderly, children and people who are chronically ill and economically disadvantaged will be more vulnerable than others. Adaptation is a valuable tool for minimizing the effects of climate change on human health, but the mechanisms involve various societal, cultural, economic, political, environmental, information and technological challenges that need to be addressed rigorously and cautiously. Developing and designing appropriate healthcare systems to meet the challenges involved with adaptation is equally important in reducing the health effects of climate variability. There is an increased need for information about climatic impacts on human health and a need to increase institutional capacity, social and human capital, leadership, communication and partnerships as well as promoting stakeholders' engagement in the adaptation processes in order to ensure success.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of corporate governance on the financial choices of non -financial companies operating in the Australian Securities Exchange. A purposive sampling technique was employed to select a total of 113 firms representing 14 sectors listed in the Australian Securities Exchange during the period from 2008 to 2021. The findings of the study revealed a positive and significant relationship between the size of the board, gender diversity among board members, board member affiliation, and board compensation with the financial decisions of the corporations. Additionally, the study identified that the presence of experienced and non -executive board members had a negative and significant impact on internally generated funding. Furthermore, it was observed that board gender diversity, board size, board member affiliation, and board compensation displayed a positive and significant association with debt financing, internally generated financing, and equity financing. Most organisations displayed a preference for internal and debt financing over equity funding. Aligning governance with financial decisions enhances firms' cost of capital. Governance quality affects capital market access, debt, and equity costs. Effective governance leads to favorable financing terms.

Abstract: The dominant perspective in the literature linking governance, globalization and public policy argues that globalization undercuts state capacity, weakening a government's ability to effectively regulate its domestic affairs. This paper shows otherwise with special reference to the Australian experience in financial regulation. It challenges the conventional wisdom that the Australian state is weak and cannot adopt anticipatory industrial policies. This paper argues that the adoption of the 'twin peaks' model of financial regulatory arrangements is an example of the existence of government-led steering in Australia which can adopt a proactive approach to financial regulation by steering and coordinating policy networks. 'Governance through hierarchy' in the financial services industry may be a function of the government's political entrepreneurship; its skill in setting and implementing an agenda; and an ability to create new policy communities and networks.

Abstract: This case study describes the development and implementation of a governance structure that prioritised First Nations peoples in a local public health Incident Command System activated for the COVID-19 pandemic response in New South Wales, Australia. Using lessons learnt from past pandemics and planning exercises, public health leaders embedded an approach whereby First Nations peoples determined and led community and culturally informed pandemic control strategies and actions.In March 2020, First Nations governance was embedded into the local public health emergency response to COVID-19 in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia, enabling First Nations staff and community members to actively participate in strategic and operational decision-making with the objective of minimising COVID-19-related risks to First Nations peoples and communities. The model provided cultural insight and oversight to the local COVID-19 response; strengthened and advanced First Nations leadership; increased the First Nations public health workforce; led the development of First Nations disease surveillance strategies; and supported working groups to appropriately respond to local needs and priorities. This model demonstrates the feasibility of reframing a standard Incident Command System to embed and value First Nations principles of self-determination and empowerment to appropriately plan and respond to public health emergencies.

Abstract: Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the experience and involvement of academics in learning analytics (LA) due to its potential for improving teaching and learning. However, findings often reflect an educational culture which is indicative of the institutional or national context where the study has occurred, resulting in bias regarding LA perspectives. Therefore, this study seeks to compare and contrast the experiences of LA among academics in Australia and Malaysia, with intentions to learn from each other's experience. Areas of comparison were: (1) academics' involvement in LA activities; (2) academics' responses to the institutional capacity in supporting LA; and 3) academics' concerns about the ethical issues surrounding LA. A survey of 353 Australian and 224 Malaysian academics revealed similarities and differences. It is evident from these results that the context and infrastructure for LA are at different stages of development in both countries. Nevertheless, the results provide an interesting reflection on academics' needs, institutional understanding, policies, and educational cultural biases in applying LA in teaching and learning in higher education institutions.

Abstract: State capacity may be a crucial factor conditioning the democratizing power of elections in authoritarian regimes. This paper develops a two-phase theory considers the different effects of state capacity on turnover in elections and democratic change after elections. In regimes with limited state capacity, manipulating elections and repressing opposition is more difficult than in regimes with extensive state capacity, rendering turnover in elections more likely in weak states. However, if the new incumbent has limited capacity to deliver public services and make policy changes after coming to power, sustainable democratic change is unlikely. Hence, state capacity is hypothesized to have a negative effect on turnover, but a positive effect on democratic change. These hypotheses are confirmed in a sample of 460 elections in 110 authoritarian regimes taking place in the period 1974 to 2012 using the Varieties of Democracy dataset. The findings suggest a need to revisit strong-state-first theories of democratization.

Abstract: We inspect the impact of financial inclusion on carbon (CO2) 2 ) emissions and the role that quality of governance plays using a global dataset from 119 countries between 2004 and 2020. We address endogeneity using the dynamic two-step generalized method of moment estimator and further test the robustness of results using the Driscol-Kraay estimator, which is crucial for addressing cross-sectional and temporal dependence. The findings showed that financial inclusion and quality of governance exhibited a positive and significant impact on CO2 2 emissions. Further analysis shows that the impact of financial inclusion and governance on CO2 2 emissions varies across countries at different stages of economic development. We also documented significant variations in the results across six geographical regions. Also, the evidence from moderation and marginal effect analysis revealed that the marginal effect of financial inclusion on CO2 2 emissions is contingent on governance quality and that improving governance quality (scores) conditions financial inclusion to minimize CO2 2 emissions across the globe. We, therefore, demonstrate that in countries with relatively higher (better) governance scores, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Singapore, and New Zealand, financial inclusion significantly mitigates CO2 2 emissions compared to countries with relatively lower (weak) governance scores, such as Iraq, Zimbabwe, Ghana, and Chad. Finally, mediation analysis also highlights that the effect of financial inclusion on CO2 2 emissions is mediated by renewable energy consumption, industrialization, and household consumption. The policy implications are discussed.

Abstract: The Henry Tax Review is a work in progress, but it has already advanced sufficiently to constitute an important case study of state capacity in Australia. Using the Henry Tax Review as a case study, this paper sheds light on the question of whether the national political system is capable of devising and implementing long-term reforms. Whilst specific policy failures inevitably have a contingent dimension in the form of poor strategy and leadership or unfavourable economic conditions, the paper discusses the erosion of institutional and relational structures which, arguably, has diminished systemic political capacity. This is tantamount to a structural weakening of state capacity in Australia, a development which has the potential to erode the potential of any government to enact significant strategic policy change.

Abstract: Violent organizations are often providers of many social services in competition with the state. We provide evidence that these organizations use the provision of social services to gain support. This strategy is only effective when it fills the void left by a weak state. We show this by studying the provision of natural disaster relief by the Pakistani state and the Taliban. We first analyze the floods of 2010 that received an inadequate response from the government and show that support for the Taliban increased in the areas affected by the flood. These effects were concentrated in places where the Taliban likely provided help and where the state under-delivered. We then study the 2005 earthquake that instead received a swift government response and show that the Taliban lost support in the affected areas. Results cannot be explained by alternate mechanisms as anger against incumbents, political competition, electoral participation, and religiosity.

Abstract: Introduction Institutions play a central role in advancing the field of reproductive health in humanitarian settings (RHHS), yet little is known about organizational capacity to deliver RHHS and how this has developed over the past decade. This study aimed to document the current institutional experiences and capacities related to RHHS. Materials and Methods Descriptive study using an online questionnaire tool. Results Respondents represented 82 institutions from 48 countries, of which two-thirds originated from low-and middle-income countries. RHHS work was found not to be restricted to humanitarian agencies (25%), but was also embraced by development organizations (25%) and institutions with dual humanitarian and development mandates (50%). Agencies reported working with refugees (81%), internally-displaced (87%) and stateless persons (20%), in camp-based settings (78%), and in urban (83%) and rural settings (78%). Sixty-eight percent of represented institutions indicated having an RHHS-related policy, 79% an accountability mechanism including humanitarian work, and 90% formal partnerships with other institutions. Seventy-three percent reported routinely appointing RH focal points to ensure coordination of RHHS implementation. There was reported progress in RHHS-related disaster risk reduction (DRR), emergency management and coordination, delivery of the Minimum Initial Services Package (MISP) for RH, comprehensive RH services in post-crisis/recovery situations, gender mainstreaming, and community-based programming. Other reported institutional areas of work included capacity development, program delivery, advocacy/policy work, followed by research and donor activities. Except for abortion-related services, respondents cited improved efforts in advocacy, capacity development and technical support in their institutions for RHHS to address clinical services, including maternal and newborn health, sexual violence prevention and response, HIV prevention, management of sexually-transmitted infections, adolescent RH, and family planning. Approximately half of participants reported that their institutions had experienced an increase in dedicated budget and staff for RHHS, a fifth no change, and 1 in 10 a decrease. The Interagency RH Kits were reportedly the most commonly used supplies to support RHHS implementation. Conclusion The results suggest overall growth in institutional capacity in RHHS over the past decade, indicating that the field has matured and expanded from crisis response to include RHHS into DRR and other elements of the emergency management cycle. It is critical to consolidate the progress to date, address gaps, and sustain momentum.

Abstract: Transitioning to more sustainable urban water management is widely accepted as an essential societal objective. While there has been significant progress in developing technical solutions to the challenges faced, numerous barriers remain at the regime level, indicating that further investigation into the regime is required. This paper reports on a social research project aimed at identifying capacity attributes of a more sustainable urban water management regime. Attributes were identified for the administrative and regulatory framework, inter- and intra-organisational and individual regime spheres. Over 125 urban water practitioners specialising in sustainability in Sydney and Melbourne were interviewed to identify the attributes of a more sustainable regime. The attributes reveal that a sustainable urban water management regime emphasises learning, diverse policy tools and institutional arrangements, together with interaction among stakeholders and professional disciplines. The interaction is characterised by respect, trust and mutual understanding. The sustainable regime attributes are compared to the traditional regime and reveal that while progress has been made towards a sustainable regime, additional improvement is required. Attributes identified across multiple regime spheres indicate potential focus areas for capacity building programs or reform efforts to more effectively enable regime change towards sustainable urban water management.

Abstract: Institutional capacity is an important element for climate change adaptation (CCA) and the development of such capacity is a great challenge in a Least Developed Country like Cambodia where resources are limited. An important first step to increasing capacity is via an understanding of the level of existing capacity; future priorities can then be subsequently identified. This study aimed to assess the capacity of organizations to implement climate change activities in Cambodia in order to provide such a basis for building capacity. Four elements of capacity were investigated in this research: (1) financial resources, (2) cooperation and coordination of stakeholders, (3) availability and quality of information on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and (4) the level of understanding of climate change vulnerability and adaptation. The data were collected through semistructured interviews with a wide range of government and non-government informants across a number of sectors. Results of the study showed that informants perceived capacity for CCA to be very constrained, especially in terms of financial resources and cooperation, and addressing these factors was ranked as the highest climate change capacity priority. Institutional capacity constraints were considered to relate more generally to weak governance of CCA. In light of our research findings, the absence of local higher education institutions in CCA activities should be addressed. The support of such institutions would provide an important mechanism to progress both capacity development as well as partnerships and coordination between different types of organizations and relevant sectors. Policy relevance Capacity for CCA within Cambodian health and water sectors was perceived to be very constrained across a range of interdependent factors. Increasing funding was ranked as the highest priority for building capacity for CCA; however, governance factors such as 'improved cooperation' were also ranked highly. Improving stakeholders' awareness of the availability of adaptation funds and resources, and their responsiveness to funding criteria, is an important implication of our research, as is improving the mobilization of local resources and the private sector. To address the issue of weak cooperation among stakeholders, improving the coordination function of the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) regarding stakeholder engagement and capacity building is crucial. Ensuring that CCA activities are based on sound information and knowledge from across different disciplines and, importantly, include the perspectives of vulnerable people themselves, ultimately underpins and supports the realization of the above priorities.

Abstract: Digitalization and the use of Smart Farming Technologies are considered a major opportunity for the future of agriculture. However, realisation of full benefits is constrained by: (1) farmers' interest in and use of big data to improve farm decision making; (2) issues of data sovereignty and trust between providers and users of data and technology; (3) institutional arrangements associated with the governance of data platforms. This paper examines the case of Australia's dairy herd milk recording system, arguably one of agriculture's first cases of 'big data' use, which collects, analyses and uses farm-level data (milk production, lactation and breeding records) to provide individual cow and herd performance information, used by individual farmers for farm management decisions. The aim of this study was to 1) examine the use of big data to add value to farm decision making; and 2) explore factors and processes, including institutional arrangements, which influence farmer engagement with and use of big data. This paper traces the Australian history of the organisation of dairy herd recording (established in 1912 and digitalized in late 1970s) and then uses findings from a longitudinal study of 7 case study dairy farms, which were incentivised to become involved in herd recording in 2015. Applying a conceptual framework linking path dependency in farm decision making and collaborative governance capacity, we find three new important dimensions of the farm user context influencing farmer demand for big data applications: 1) the transition to a new business stage; 2) the additionality farmers seek from data generated in one component of the farm system to other subsystems, and 3) the use of data in long term or strategic decision making. Further, we identified critical attributes of support services in addressing digital literacy, capacity and capability issues at farm level, including diversity in data presentation formats and facilitation of the on-farm transition process through intermediary herd test organisations. The role of farmers as governance actors, or citizens in the decisions of the trajectory of big data applications, adds to understanding of the nature of collaborative governance arrangements that support farm engagement.

Abstract: Managing large river basins for sustainability is a contentious social-ecological arena challenging traditional scientific and rational planning approaches to water and related natural resources governance. "Crises" are inevitable but double-edged: creating threats and uncertainties, but also new opportunities to shape trajectories of change and avoid adverse consequences. A case study of the large remote cross-border Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), in arid central Australia, shows how over two decades a series of social-ecological and political-administrative "crises" emerged, posing significant environmental and social dilemmas for water governance, while also opening up opportunities for institutional change. This article examines the role of crises in the emergence and evolution of water governance in the LEB, how they were perceived, the challenges and opportunities posed, social and institutional responses, and governance capacity outcomes. Finally, it reflects on emergent crises as opportunities for more systemic and adaptive change in large river basins.

Abstract: In the context of calls for a 'third way' which proposes the abandonment of many of the social democratic and statist commitments of the postwar era, this paper reviews both the responsibilities accepted by peak bodies such as ACOSS and those that ought to be retained by government. It is sceptical of claims that social policy debates in Australia lead to the conclusion that welfare state development here has been satisfactory. Social democratic objectives (derived from intellectual contributions in the 1940s and 1950s as well as from the comparative political economy of the 1980s and 1990s) emphasize more decommodified provision of services than can be readily admitted in Australia. If the demand for social welfare and social policy continues to increase to the extent suggested by past and present circumstances, serious implications emerge for both public and private providers.

Abstract: Our newly constructed index of corporate governance quality (CGQ) provides comprehensive and robust evidence for the association between CGQ and stock liquidity in the pure order-driven Australia market. By using a large sample of 1207 firms from 2001 to 2013, we find a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have greatly improved stock liquidity. Specifically, we find that better governed firms have a lower trading cost, smaller price impacts of trade, and higher trading speed. Moreover, the empirical results reveal that CGQ improves stock liquidity because it is associated with higher information disclosure.

The sufficient elaboration of legislation in the sphere of combating corruption in New Zealand, Singapore, Australia and the USA is noted. Fundamental legal acts containing norms on anti-corruption are indicated. Features of governmental policy in the USA, New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia are consistently highlighted. The conclusion is made that the impressive results of combating corruption in these countries are primarily associated with the recovery of the economy in general, with public service reform and with chang-ing attitudes towards shaping the "integrity" of state structure.

Abstract: A remarkable process of reform of intergovernmental arrangements was initiated in Australia in 1990 designed, according to its proponents, 'to improve our national efficiency and international competitiveness and to improve the delivery and quality of services governments provide.' Unlike previous 'new federalisms' in Australia (and elsewhere) the reform process on this occasion was neither totally unilateral, nor top-down in design and implementation. Rather, while reflecting the commonwealth (federal) government's frustrations at the limits imposed by the federal system on its political power and administrative capacity, the process intentionally was cooperative, incorporating all state and territory government leaders, and including representatives of local government. In the context of a review of the origins, nature and objectives of the reform initiative, this article points both to the valuable innovations embodied in its processes, and to the of reduced political access and citizen participation created by its attempts to apply 'single-government' managerialist principles to the redesign of intergovernmental arrangements in federal systems. Political and bureaucratic objectives, combined with a lack of adequate appreciation of federal principles, led, in our view, to an attempt to supplant participatory politics with relatively less accessible and responsive managerial structures.

Abstract: Food security is an issue, not only in developing countries but also in developed economies such as Australia where people from vulnerable groups cannot access affordable and appropriate food on a daily basis. Agencies emphasise the need for collaborative approaches to such complex, multi-sectoral challenges. This article analyses two inter-governmental partnership approaches facilitating local government's response to food insecurity in 12 municipalities within the state of Victoria. We focus on the partnership approaches to collaboration, processes and structures, and collective outcomes. The comparative data analysis from in-depth interviews and document analysis of project-associated materials and municipal policies provides insight into the different partnership approaches. Results suggest that while strategically designed and focused inter-governmental partnerships can build local government capacity to respond to food security, there are systemic, regulatory, and resource barriers in play. In conclusion, the implications of these findings for future inter-governmental approaches to address complex challenges are considered. Intergovernmental partnerships are increasingly used to address complex multi-sectoral challenges like food security, which is a problem even in developed economies such as Australia. This article identifies a need to mitigate systemic, regulatory and resource barriers that limit two state-local government partnership approaches to enhance food security within twelve municipalities.

Abstract: Political scientists have recently debated the extent to which strong state capacity helps authoritarian regimes to win elections and extend their rule. This article proposes that it is not only important to disaggregate the various forms of state capacity mobilized for that purpose, but also to analyze the sequence with which autocracies deploy them. Using Suharto's New Order regime in Indonesia as a case study, I argue that regimes mobilize different forms of state capacity in distinct phases of their development, and that the sequencing of this deployment can have implications for the regime's endurance. Suharto, for example, gradually reduced the importance of coercion as he increasingly focused on the state's ability to facilitate elite co-optation and economic patronage. This helped to extend the regime's endurance as long as the economy flourished, but also made it vulnerable to the fluctuations in the world economy that caused its demise in 1998.

Abstract: This paper explores the association between director turnover and increased audit fees in Australia. The study, aligned with upper echelon theory, reveals that the characteristics and actions of top management, as reflected in director turnover, impact corporate decisions and risktaking behavior. Specifically, higher director turnover is linked to elevated audit fees, disrupting the stability of top management's monitoring and advisory functions. The association is more pronounced for external turnover compared to internal turnover. Additionally, firms with robust corporate governance quality exhibit a weakened positive relationship between director turnover and audit fees. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic further amplifies the director turnover/audit fees connection. The findings suggest that auditors are likely to consider and price in the impact of board instability on internal controls and monitoring/advisory functions.

Abstract: Municipal planning represents a key avenue for local adaptation, but is subject to recognised constraints. To date, these constraints have focused on simplistic factors such as limited resources and lack of information. In this paper we argue that this focus has obscured a wider set of constraints which need to be acknowledged and addressed if adaptation is likely to advance through municipal planning. Although these recognised constraints are relevant, we argue that what underpins these issues are more fundamental challenges affecting local, placed-based planning by drawing on the related field of community-based environmental planning (CBEP). In considering a wider set of constraints to practical attempts towards adaptation, the paper considers planning based on a case study of three municipalities in Sydney, Australia in 2008. The results demonstrate that climate adaptation was widely accepted as an important issue for planning conducted by local governments. However, it was yet to be embedded in planning practice which retained a strong mitigation bias in relation to climate change. In considering the case study, we draw attention to factors thus far under-acknowledged in the climate adaptation literature. These include leadership, institutional context and competing planning agendas. These factors can serve as constraints or enabling mechanisms for achieving climate adaptation depending upon how they are exploited in any given situation. The paper concludes that, through addressing these issues, local, place-based planning can play a greater role in achieving climate adaptation.

Abstract: We construct a governance index based oil several attributes known to be associated with good corporate governance. After checking that the index is positively associated with standard indicators of firm performance, we use it to evaluate the returns oil governance-sorted portfolios. Our main finding is that poorly governed firms significantly outperform better-governed firms. However, this result derives from the greater risk exposure of poorly governed firms. After adjusting for size and book-to-market, excess returns become insignificant across all portfolios. We verify that neither the sample period nor the behavior of specific industries is responsible for this outcome. Consistent with market efficiency, stock prices appear to fairly reflect the higher (lower) risk associated with poor (good) corporate governance. J. Japanese Int. Economies 22 (4) (2008) 647-662.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Towards institutional fit? The reality of institutional capacity through two food security exemplars

Abstract: Global challenges face many local governments, which in turn, need to rapidly build their capacity to respond. Local government requires alignment with organizational partners, higher levels of government, external societal actors and local constituents, through the concept of institutional fit, to acquire the capacity to respond to global challenges. Institutional fit discursively enables local government to increase its reach and collective capacity. We analysed institutional fit in two local government case studies in Australia that aimed to improve food security through addressing equity and other social aspects to the challenge. Case study analysis was based on in-depth interviews, primary document analysis and secondary data analysis pertaining to the food security initiatives. Findings show that collaborative partnerships can provide greater understanding of the goals, roles and higher-level commitment needed for institutional fit. Aligning capacities and roles between and within organizations and institutions is also required because local government is severely restricted without whole-of-institutional commitment to similar goals. We found, however, that local government is constrained in its response to change because of the complex nature of the challenge and because neoliberalism militates against fit within the wider domain of the entire institutional response. We argue that institutional fit needs to be embedded within any change process. More nuanced and targeted understandings of the roles of each organization can then be understood, along with the role of power within the institutional domain, so that appropriate planning occurs to identify and target which responses are achieved and by whom.

Abstract: Vietnam's higher education is highly centralized in terms of its governance and management. A couple of higher education reform plans have been introduced over the past decade but they seem to result in poor outcomes. This paper addresses the challenges faced in the areas of governance, quality assurance and finance by a 'key' university located in the middle of Vietnam. These are explored by means of a case study approach involving interviews with a cross-section of significant former senior managers, current senior managers and current middle managers. Reform at this university is proceeding at a very slow pace. The impediments are both institutional and national. The implications of the case study for the reform of higher education in Vietnam are discussed.

Abstract: A series of defaults, a distinctive corporate environment and inconclusive findings in literature make Australia an interesting case in which to investigate the association between corporate governance and default risk. Using a large panel of 1086 non-financial firms from 2001 to 2013, we find that better governed firms are strongly associated with a lower level of default risk, and that the association is stronger among firms with more growth opportunities. Moreover, empirical evidence supports the role of stock liquidity as a channel of the relationship. Overall these findings have practical implications for the stakeholders in Australia.

Abstract: Community-based forest management systems (CBFMS) are becoming increasingly popular in developing countries where 31% of the total forest is either managed or owned by the community. This paper presents the results of a four-country study conducted in 2017 in Nepal, Bhutan, India and Myanmar concerning the governance quality of CBFMS. The introduction outlines the global threat to forests, the contribution that forest based emissions make to climate change, and the policy response of the international and national communities including REDD +. The next section provides a snapshot of CBFMS in the four case study countries, and is followed by an account of the methodology, approach, framework of analysis and sampling surveys undertaken during the course of, and informing, the research. The results of the surveys revealed that perceptions of governance quality, as well as governance priorities, varied between the countries, and also at the three levels of government (national, sub-national and local) within a country. For example, Myanmar and Bhutan had very high governance ratings from local levels compared to other levels, whereas, Nepal and India had similar ratings for all levels. Further, regarding the prioritisation of different indicators, Myanmar gave highest priority to "inclusiveness" at the local level but "democracy" at the national level. The reasons for the similarities and differences between and within these countries and the possible implications are discussed.

Abstract: IntroductionThe delivery of services to improve Aboriginal health and well-being must centre culture and integrate a social and emotional well-being understanding and approaches. These approaches are essential in increasing access to, and engagement with, health services, as well as ensuring culturally safe, person-centred and community-centred care. This study will evaluate the Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia's social and emotional well-being model of service being piloted in five Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services across five of Western Australia's regions. The model of service includes the establishment of interdisciplinary social and emotional well-being teams and a four-pillar approach to service delivery.Methods and analysisAn Aboriginal Participatory Action Research methodology will be undertaken which calls for Indigenous leadership and governance, capacity-building of community co-researchers and engagement in reflexive practice. The evaluation will take a mixed-methods approach to data collection, including at each pilot site, yarns with up to five clients engaging with social and emotional well-being services; qualitative interviews with up to five service providers at each site, and up to five key knowledge holders from stakeholders including funders and commissioning bodies; the collection of clinical data; facilitated discussion using the social and emotional well-being Systems Assessment Tool; and document analysis and cost-estimation. Analysis will be guided by a client journey mapping framework, and data will be collectively analysed through a socioecological framework to understand the connections and inter-relatedness between client outcomes and experiences, social and emotional well-being team and service provider experiences, service systems and governance structures.Ethics and disseminationThis evaluation was approved by the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (HREC1204). The findings will be disseminated through the production of an evaluation report and academic publications and presentations. Findings will also be disseminated through community forums and plain language summaries. These outputs will detail evaluation findings and recommendations, the process of evaluation through an Aboriginal Participatory Action Research approach and the collaborative stakeholder relationship-building that underpinned the project.

Abstract: Post-disaster reconstruction relies on, and is shaped by, the good intentions of states, non-governmental organizations, and donors. These intentions, however, are inescapably framed by historical circumstances and cultural values. Consequently, post-disaster interventions can reinforce patterns of prejudice, injustice, and disadvantage that were entrenched in pre-disaster settings. Focusing on the experiences of Indigenous Rukai communities in southern Taiwan during recovery and reconstruction following Typhoon Morakot in 2009, this article explores the challenges faced in addressing Indigenous-specific concerns in post-disaster reconstruction and community development. We argue that institutional capacity (and capacity deficits) and the procedural vulnerability created in post-disaster responses are components of the risk landscape which require greater attention to diverse cultural values, protocols, and experiences in fostering resilient and inclusive disaster recovery approaches. In Taiwan, the particular complexities of Indigenous geographies, colonial and postcolonial circumstances, and contemporary political dynamics make developing approaches that are respectful of Indigenous cultural values, social aspirations, and political processes not only more difficult but also more important in shaping post-disaster community at multiple scales. Attentiveness to these values, aspirations, and processes generates opportunities for decreasing vulnerability to the extraordinary and the everyday disasters that communities confront.

Abstract: Majority of the literature suggest that the determination of natural resources as either a curse or a blessing cannot be solely based on their impact on economic and social development. This study investigates the relationship between sustainable human development, governance quality, green energy innovation, and CO2 emissions in oil and gas sector of China. The data from 2002 to 2022 was taken for the analysis. This study employed the novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (D-ARDL) method to examine long-term and short-term relationships. Our results of short-term analysis demonstrated that all the variables - institutional governance, sustainable human development renewable energy innovation, government stability and renewable energy consumption-have an influential role in reduce carbon emissions. The results of long run analysis reiterate findings of short run, highlighting the inverse relationship of the variables with carbon emissions. The t-statistic shows of such relationships are statistically significant in the long run. The findings of the study offer valuable insights and empirical evidence to reduce emissions using governance quality, sustainable human development, green energy innovation and renewable energy consumption in oil and gas sector of China. Our findings demonstrate that implementation of these strategies require long-term commitment and concerted efforts.

Abstract: The UNFCCC requires REDD+ countries wishing to receive results-based payments to measure, report and verify (MRV) REDD+ impacts; and outlines technical guidelines and good governance requirements for MRV. This article examines institutional effectiveness of REDD+ MRV by assessing countries' progress in implementing these technical guidelines and good governance requirements, from three dimensions. Ownership of technical methods examines whether countries own technical methods for forest area and area change measuring, and for estimating forest carbon stocks; and whether national MRV systems cover all forests, land uses and carbon pools. Administrative capacity examines development of administrative competence to implement MRV. Good governance examines whether countries espouses norms of good governance in their MRV systems. We apply these dimensions to assess and compare progress in 13 REDD+ countries, based on a review of national and international documents. Findings show that REDD+ countries have high to very high ownership of technical methods. However, majority ranks only low to moderate on administrative capacity and good governance. This means that although countries have started developing technical methods for MRV, they are yet to develop the competence necessary to administer MRV and to inculcate good governance in MRV. The article explain the scores and suggest ways of improving implementation of REDD+ MRV. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Liberal democratic states like Australia manage criminal justice issues in ways which reflect an inbuilt tension between liberal and democratic values. Liberal democracies are responsive both to liberal claims and to democratic claims. As a result, policy debates and strategies can oscillate between (on the one hand) liberal sensitivity to individual rights and opposition to enhanced state capacity and (on the other hand) democratically legitimised community norms and collective values. Four dime-related policy debates - about the creation and operation of the National Crime Authority, about strategies for combating drug-related crime, about gun control legislation and about identity systems to counter money laundering, tax evasion and public benefit fraud - illustrate the characteristic liberal democratic mode of politics in operation. The spectrum of policy responses to crime issues within liberal democratic political systems corresponds to an. analogous spectrum within criminology which encompasses individualistic and structuralist conceptions of the nature and causes of crime.

Abstract: Recent work on industry policy argues that group and state capacity are important in underpinning (or undermining) the capacity to govern industrial development. Put simply, group capacity-alongside state capacity-is deemed an important ingredient in any recipe for (re)developing national industry. This article further develops the literature on governance and transformative capacity, adding deliberative networking as a key facet. Examining the development of the organic farming sector in Australia, it is argued that the absence of transformative capacity frustrates development. Specifically, although the state has slowly come to see a need for some interaction and facilitation of organic industry development, particularly of a national domestic standard, this intervention is made difficult by the absence of: (i) capable organic industry organisations; (ii) 'in-house' departmental expertise; and (iii) venues capable of fostering policy deliberation. We argue that the reworked concept of transformative capacity can have wider application in making sense of industry development in other infant industries.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss is one of the most significant drivers of ecosystem change and is projected to continue at a rapid rate. While protected areas, such as national parks, are seen as important refuges for biodiversity, their effectiveness in stemming biodiversity decline has been questioned. Public agencies have a critical role in the governance of many such areas, but there are tensions between the need for these agencies to be more "adaptive" and their current operating environment. Our aim is to analyze how institutions enable or constrain capacity to conserve biodiversity in a globally significant cross-border network of protected areas, the Australian Alps. Using a novel conceptual framework for diagnosing biodiversity institutions, our research examined institutional adaptive capacity and more general capacity for conserving biodiversity. Several intertwined issues limit public agencies' capacity to fulfill their conservation responsibilities. Narrowly defined accountability measures constrain adaptive capacity and divert attention away from addressing key biodiversity outcomes. Implications for learning were also evident, with protected area agencies demonstrating successful learning for on-ground issues but less success in applying this learning to deeper policy change. Poor capacity to buffer political and community influences in managing significant cross-border drivers of biodiversity decline signals poor fit with the institutional context and has implications for functional fit. While cooperative federalism provides potential benefits for buffering through diversity, it also means protected area agencies have restricted authority to address cross-border threats. Restrictions on staff authority and discretion, as public servants, have further implications for deploying capacity. This analysis, particularly the possibility of fostering "ambidexterity"-creatively responding to political pressures in a way that also achieves a desirable outcome for biodiversity conservation-is one promising way of building capacity to buffer both political influences and ecological pressures. The findings and the supporting analysis provide insight into how institutional capacity to conserve biodiversity can be enhanced in protected areas in Australia and elsewhere, especially those governed by public agencies and/or multiple organizations and across jurisdictions.

Abstract: Purpose - Institutional governance theory is used to explain voluntary corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting in the context of a market governance system in the absence of climate change public policy. This paper seeks to hypothesise that GHG reporting is related to internal organisation systems, external privately promulgated guidance and EU ETS trading. Design/methodology/approach - A two-stage approach is used. The initial model examines whether firms' GHG disclosures are associated with internal organisation systems factors: environmental management systems (EMS), corporate governance quality and environmental management committees as well as external private guidance provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 187 ASX 300 firms. EU ETS trading is also included. Determinants of the extent and credibility of GHG disclosure is examined in the second stage where an index constructed from the GHG reporting standard "ISO 14064-1" items for a sub-sample of 80 disclosing firms as the dependent variable. Findings - Firms that voluntarily disclose GHGs have EMSs (uncertified and certified), higher corporate governance quality and publicly report to the CDP, tend to be large and in the energy and mining and industrial sectors. The credibility and extent of disclosures are related to the existence of a certified EMS, public reporting to the CDP, and use of the GRI. Firms that disclose more credible information are more likely to be large and in the energy and mining, industrial and services sectors. Originality/value - The paper shows that some proactive but pragmatic Australian firms are disclosing their GHGs voluntarily for competitive advantage in the current market governance system in the absence of public policy.

Abstract: We report on the establishment of communities of practice at four Australian institutions and evaluate their effectiveness and durability as a means of building staff and institutional capacity for interdisciplinary teaching. A community of practice approach is a potentially valuable methodology for overcoming dynamics of fragmentation, isolation and competition within universities. The communities we established were anchored by a shared focus on the topic of climate change and they worked collaboratively to build relationships of trust and reciprocity between teachers in a wide range of disciplines. The aim of each community was to improve the teaching of climate change through enabling members to integrate diverse disciplinary perspectives, to teach collaboratively, to promote innovation through exchange and to demonstrate leadership within their institutions. The key factors that made our communities effective and durable are: (1) designation of two leadership roles, activator and facilitator, (2) provision for institutional autonomy in domesticating the model to fit local circumstances and (3) a pragmatic emphasis on opportunities for teaching innovation and leadership within existing administrative structures, teaching programs and workloads. We conclude that suitably designed and resourced communities of practice are a viable means of improving interdisciplinary teaching of complex problems by facilitating both staff development and institutional learning.

Abstract: The river basin organisation (RBO) model has been advocated as organisational best practice for sustainable river basin management, despite scant evidence of its effectiveness to manage complex river systems. This review provides a framework which combines functional social-institutional capacities with basin biophysical indicators in a diagnostic tool to determine RBO governance performance. Each of these two capacities are represented by four groups of indicators respectively covering social learning capacity and biophysical capacity. The distance and alignment between capacity and measure of performance scores can be used to prioritise program planning and resource allocation for improving river basin governance, and to undertake periodic evaluations as part of a trajectory analysis. The diagnostic functional framework provides tangible indicators of performance around key concepts in river basin governance. It offers a first attempt to strengthen the position and effectiveness of an RBO in dealing with complex adaptive systems.

Abstract: Coral reef restoration is gaining considerable momentum globally in response to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs. In Australia, as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP), a range of unconventional interventions are currently being investigated to help the Great Barrier Reef resist, repair and recover from climate change. Many of these interventions are based on innovative approaches, such as assisted evolution. The regulatory environment is likely to be critical in determining the feasibility and viability of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It influences what, where and how to restore, who should be responsible for, engaged in, and benefit from restoration. This study explores the regulatory implications of proposed restoration and adaptation interventions in the context of the Great Barrier Reef. This includes mapping the existing regulatory and governance landscape, establishing an approach to account for regulatory requirements of restoration and adaptation interventions, and examining regulatory issues associated with their development and deployment. The study also scopes administrative capacity; i.e., the capacity of regulators in terms of resources and skills required to assess novel risks and impacts of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It provides important insights that may prove useful for other jurisdictions, where ecosystem restoration and adaptation has become an imperative under a fast-changing climate.

Abstract: The Government of Indonesia (GoI) increasingly relies on the private sector financing to build and operate infrastructures through public private partnership (PPP) schemes. However, PPP does not automatically provide the solution for the financing scheme due to value for money (VFM) issues. The procurement authority must show whether a PPP proposal is the optimal solution that provides best VFM outcome. The paper presents a literature review of comparing quantitative VFM methodology for PPP infrastructure project procurement in Indonesia and Australia. Public Sector Comparator (PSC) is used to assess the potential project VFM quantitatively in Australia. In Indonesia, the PSC has not been applied, where the PPP procurement authority tends to utilize a common project evaluation method that ignores the issues of risk. Unlike the conventional price bid evaluation, the PSC enables a financial comparison including costs/gains and risks. Since the construction of PSC is primarily on risk management approach, it can facilitate risk negotiation processes between the involved parties. The study indicates that the quantitative VFM methodology of PSC is potentially applicable in Indonesia for water supply sector. Various supporting regulations are available that emphasize the importance of VFM and risk management in infrastructure investment. However, the study also reveals a number of challenges that need to be anticipated, such as the need of a more comprehensive PPP policy at both central and local government level, a more specific legal instrument for bidding evaluation method and the issue of institutional capacity development in PPP Units at the local level.

Abstract: The more a government is effective and fair, the more legitimacy that government is likely to attain, and the more it will possess the potential to elicit compliance without excessive monitoring or punitive action. We explore this proposition using contemporary survey data from sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, we are interested in the conditions that promote popular legitimating beliefs that provide support for governments that are attempting to serve their entire populations competently and in a manner that is relatively impartial and equitable. This article provides empirical support for a long hypothesized link between the extent of government effectiveness, procedural justice, and citizens' willingness to defer to governmental tax authority. The sample, drawn from a continuum of developing societies in Africa, allows us to analyze the impact of variations in government effectiveness and citizen perceptions of fairness on the sense of obligation to comply with the tax authorities, our indicator for legitimating beliefs.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the impact of national governance quality on clean energy supplies in developing countries. We used a large sample of 103 developing countries over 21 years. We employ pooled ordinary least squares as the primary estimator. Additionally, we apply a Fixed Effect and the Two-Step System-Generalized Method of Moments to mitigate contemporaneity bias. Following prior studies, we construct national governance quality from the six World Governance Indicators. Consistent with our expectations, we find a positive and significant association between national governance quality and clean energy supplies. The results show that countries with high national governance quality are more likely to generate high amounts of clean energy than low-governed countries and to experience a high green economy. The results are also significant when the governance indicator is disaggregated into individual components. However, in a continental analysis, we found that the link between national governance quality and clean energy supplies is stronger in Africa than on other continents. Our results are robust to alternative measurements and econometric identification strategies.

Abstract: Objectives Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) provide subsidised access to health services for the poor. Proxy means tests (PMTs) for income are typically employed to identify eligible beneficiaries for subsidised services but often result in significant mistargeting of benefits. We assessed the PMT approach used in Myanmar's hospital equity fund (HEF). Methods We analysed inclusion/exclusion errors by comparing household eligibility under the PMT used for HEF with household consumption (the gold standard proxy for income in LMICs). We assessed receipt of benefits post-hospitalisation against HEF eligibility rules and household income. Focus groups/interviews were conducted to understand administrative factors that influence targeting. We modelled (linear regression) predictors of household consumption to improve PMT accuracy. Results We found large targeting errors (86% of households in the bottom consumption quartile would be excluded and 15% of households in the top consumption quartile deemed eligible). HEF scores for PMT held little explanatory power for household income: 93% of individuals meeting the HEF eligibility criteria did not receive benefits post-hospitalisation, while 23% of ineligible individuals received programme support. Re-weighting PMT indicators on electricity access, land ownership and livestock ownership, and assigning weights to home-ownership, households with elderly/disabled members and household head education levels could significantly improve targeting accuracy. Poor programme awareness and uneven adherence to official eligibility determination procedures among staff likely affected targeting. Conclusions Re-weighting PMT indicators and increasing training and communication about qualification procedures could improve allocation of limited funds, though accurate targeting may continue to be challenging in contexts of low state capacity.

Abstract: Indigenous peoples within the Murray-Darling Basin have traditionally struggled for the recognition of their cultural, social, environmental, spiritual, commercial and economic connection to the waters that they have traditionally used, as well as their right to engage in all stages of water planning processes. Despite Australian national and federal frameworks providing for the inclusion of Indigenous Australians' objectives in planning frameworks, water plans have rarely addressed these objectives in water, or the strategies to achieve them. Indeed, insufficient resources, a lack of institutional capacity in both Indigenous communities and agencies and an inadequate understanding of Indigenous people's objectives in water management have limited the extent to which Indigenous objectives are addressed in water plans within the Murray-Darling Basin. In this context, the adoption of specific guidelines to meet Indigenous requirements in relation to basin water resources is crucial to support Indigenous engagement in water planning processes. Using insights from participatory planning methods and human rights frameworks, this article outlines a set of alternative and collaborative guidelines to improve Indigenous involvement in water planning and to promote sustainable and just water allocations.

Abstract: Considerable effort in recent years has gone into rebuilding fragile states. However, the debates over the effectiveness of such state-building exercises have tended to neglect that capacity building and the associated good governance programmes which comprise contemporary state building are essentially about transforming the state - meaning the ways in which political power is produced and reproduced. State capacity is now often presented as the missing link required for generating positive development outcomes and security. However, rather than being an objective and technical measure, capacity building constitutes a political and ideological mechanism for operationalising projects of state transnationalisation. The need to question prevailing notions of state capacity has become apparent in light of the failure of many state-building programmes. Such programmes have proven difficult to implement, and implementation has rarely achieved the expected development turnarounds or alleviation of violent conflict in those countries. In this article it is argued that, to identify the potential trajectories Of Such interventions, we must understand the role state building currently plays in domestic politics, and in particular, the ways in which processes of state transformation affect the development of different and often conflicting power bases within the state. This argument is examined using examples from the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands.

Abstract: Rapid decentralisation in Indonesia has shifted responsibility for managing substantial public funding from national to district governments and increased the importance of local government at the district level in delivering public services. Local government budget delays have become a huge problem as they not only delay the local government's delivery of services but also reduce its functional capacity. Our research assesses problems of budget delay in Indonesian districts. Three districts were chosen as case studies for interviews and group discussions. The research finds that human capacity and administrative problems have slowed the development and enactment of budgets. Moreover, efforts to keep election promises, especially to develop infrastructure, have not only brought a lengthy process of bargaining for economic and financial resources but also undermined the participatory budget process. This has been intensified by poor political interaction, as shown in the three case studies.

Abstract: To build capacity for addressing complex sustainable development challenges, governments, development agencies, and non-governmental organizations are making substantial investments in governance networks. Yet, enthusiasm for establishing governance networks is not always matched by empirical evidence on their effectiveness. This gap challenges these groups to know whether investing in governance networks is worth their time and effort; a weighing-up that is particularly critical in contexts of limited resources. Through a qualitative case study in Solomon Islands, we evaluate the extent to which a governance network, called the Malaita Provincial Partners for Development, contributed to four dimensions of collaborative governance capacity: individual, relational, organizational, and institutional. We find that the network made moderate contributions to individual, relational and organizational capacity, while institutional capacity remained low despite the presence of the network. Based on these findings, we argue that governance networks are not a panacea. Continued efforts are needed to establish when, how, and in what contexts collaborative networks are effective for building collaborative capacity for sustainable development.

Abstract: European Cohesion Policy is a complex scheme that allocates financial resources to European regions. The implementation of the policy is based on an articulated multi-level governance that involves local and national authorities and the European Commission. Local authorities often face difficulties in using structural funds due to limits in their administrative capacity (supply) and/or inefficiencies in adequately stimulating applications' submission (demand). By modelling and simulating the implementation of the policy, we explore how operations and decisions at the local authorities' and potential applicants' level (micro-foundations) explain emerging patterns of funds' absorption at a regional level (macro-behaviours). Building upon a mixed-methods approach combining field research and computer simulation, we develop a model capturing the key cause-effect relationships among agents and resources within the Cohesion Policy supply-and-demand system. The outcomes elucidate how poor local administrative capabilities, including staff skills, may entail delays and low absorption performances, while showcasing the factors affecting potential applicants' decision to submit.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to use insurance stock returns as an indicator of insurance activities, and apply a dynamic panel technique to examine the link between the role of insurance and economic growth. Our empirical results show that after we control for the variations of market index returns, there is a significantly positive relationship between insurance stock returns and future economic growth. Furthermore, we also investigate how law environment and governance quality affect the link between the role of insurance and economic growth. The empirical results are consistent with our expectation that a well-defined law environment and governance quality facilitate the functioning of insurance companies, and strengthen the role of insurance in economic growth. We find generally that the effect of law and governance on the link between the role of insurance and economic growth is more significant in developed markets than in emerging markets.

Abstract: In their Institutions for the Earth (1993), Haas, Keohane and Levy argue that, at the international level, three fundamental conditions must be met for the effective management of environmental problems. They summarise these conditions as the three 'Cs'-the building of concern; the existence of a suitable contractual environment; and the growth of state capacity. We applied the Haas, Keohane and Levy (HKL) model to three case studies at the national level, in order to ascertain the extent to which the three Cs explained the emergence of successful institutional regimes. We found that two of the three variables-improvements to the contractual environment and increases in state capacity-had considerable explanatory power. Concern was important in providing the motive force for change, but high levels of concern did not lead to effective institutional regimes unless the other two factors were present. We found a strong reciprocal relationship between state capacity and the contractual environment-the ability to monitor solutions and to generate policy-relevant 'trustable' information, was positively associated with improved negotiating structures and outcomes.

Abstract: This study examines the quest for environmental sustainability in Africa by analyzing the roles of natural resource abundance, governance quality, and government expenditure. It explores the relationships between these variables, employing the N-shaped hypothesis across 42 African countries from 1986 to 2020 grouped into resource-rich and resource-poor countries. Utilizing the Lewbel 2SLS modeling technique, the research evaluates how these factors interact and impact carbon and nitrous emissions in the region. The findings reveal distinct patterns: resource-poor countries exhibit an N-shaped relationship between natural resource abundance and emissions. In contrast, resource-rich countries show such patterns between government expenditure and carbon emissions. Moreover, in resource-rich countries, higher natural resource abundance, government expenditure, and governance effectiveness tend to increase carbon emissions but decrease nitrous emissions. Conversely, in resource-poor economies, carbon emissions decrease with natural resource abundance and governance quality but increase with government expenditure and effectiveness. Additionally, regulatory quality positively correlates with nitrous emissions across all contexts. The study's insights offer valuable guidance for policymakers aiming to foster environmental sustainability, emphasizing tailored strategies based on the diverse impacts of natural resources, governance, and government spending across different economic contexts.

Abstract: This article documents terrain ruggedness as an underlying cause of lack of state capacity. The paper contends that rugged topography poses significant costs to cooperation among the constituent groups within the state. This problem then translates into inability to commit to policies and under-provision of public goods, leading to such outcomes as poor protection of rule of law, limited tax revenue, civil violence, and ultimately, a weak state apparatus. Using several indicators capturing different dimensions of state capacity, the paper econometrically tests its argument in a sample of 187 independent countries and finds robust and clear evidence in favor of its reasoning. Further, the paper documents that delayed urbanization constitutes an important transmission mechanism for the significant role of terrain ruggedness in reduced state capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Mainstreaming climate change adaptation (CCA) into plans and programs is still a new approach in adaptation and thus there is limited information on how to operationalize it on-ground. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into the local land use plans in the province of Albay, Philippines. Specifically, this paper developed 20 quantitative "mainstreaming indicators" to assess the state-of-play and the challenges for local mainstreaming. These indicators were classified under three groupings, namely, the information, institutional, and resource capacities of systems. Qualitative analysis of the indicator scores suggested that developing the institutional capacities of local governments is crucial in the local mainstreaming process. Likewise, the results highlighted the "institutional issues" indicator as the primary barrier in operationalizing the approach. These institutional issues are: fragmented laws and regulations; overlapping policy requirements; and the lack of guidelines for mainstreaming CCA into the local land use plans. Meanwhile, the "leadership" indicator, as signified by a climate change champion in Albay, was evaluated as an opportunity for local mainstreaming. The champion effectively led the CCA efforts because the existing institutional mechanisms supported the champion's capacity to influence the behavior of people and produce collective action towards CCA.

Abstract: In urban and suburban areas, stormwater runoff is a primary stressor on surface waters. Conventional urban stormwater drainage systems often route runoff directly to streams and rivers, thus exacerbating pollutant inputs and hydrologic disturbance, and resulting in the degradation of ecosystem structure and function. Decentralized stormwater management tools, such as low impact development (LID) or water sensitive urban design (WSUD), may offer a more sustainable solution to stormwater management if implemented at a watershed scale. These tools are designed to pond, infiltrate, and harvest water at the source, encouraging evaporation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and re-use of stormwater. While there are numerous demonstrations of WSUD practices, there are few examples of widespread implementation at a watershed scale with the explicit objective of protecting or restoring a receiving stream. This article identifies seven major impediments to sustainable urban stormwater management: (1) uncertainties in performance and cost, (2) insufficient engineering standards and guidelines, (3) fragmented responsibilities, (4) lack of institutional capacity, (5) lack of legislative mandate, (6) lack of funding and effective market incentives, and (7) resistance to change. By comparing experiences from Australia and the United States, two developed countries with existing conventional stormwater infrastructure and escalating stream ecosystem degradation, we highlight challenges facing sustainable urban stormwater management and offer several examples of successful, regional WSUD implementation. We conclude by identifying solutions to each of the seven impediments that, when employed separately or in combination, should encourage widespread implementation of WSUD with watershed-based goals to protect human health and safety, and stream ecosystems.

Abstract: In view of past environmental degradation and anticipated climate change impacts, we assessed the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. In a workshop with staff from three Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) who had jurisdiction over three sub-basins, as well as technical experts, nine adaptation options were identified that ranged from environmental flows, restoring river channel habitat, reoperating infrastructure and controlling invasive species. A Catchment Adaptation Framework was developed and used to assess and compare these adaptation options with each of the CMAs, drawing on interviews with their key stakeholders, to identify the risks, benefits and costs. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation can augment catchment management programs and requires investment in a suite of different but complementary measures to lower risk. Our research found institutional challenges in implementing this approach, including the complexities of multi-agency management, constricting legal requirements, narrow funding arrangements, under-developed institutional capacity, difficulties of implementing catchment-scale programs on private property and the need to adhere to community expectations. These institutional issues are ubiquitous internationally and point to the wider issues of providing sufficient management capacity to support adaptation. The Catchment Adaptation Framework presented here enables river basin managers to systematically assess the adaptation options to better inform their decision-making.

Abstract: This paper argues that neoliberalism should be viewed not as a unified coherent project but as a series of complex and overlapping strategies that produce hybrid and always emergent forms of governance. To substantiate this argument, the paper reflects on the recent history of Sydney's metropolitan planning and rejects any simple characterisation of its having been transformed from a social-democratic to a neoliberal form of governance. Instead it traces the unevenness with which neoliberalist aspirations and forms of governance have been enacted through metropolitan planning. In particular, it examines the enduring scope of state institutional capacity to pursue desired spatial and distributional outcomes through planning and suggests that the current reinvigoration of Sydney's metropolitan planning is an opportunity to enhance that capacity and to pursue 'after-neoliberalist' planning possibilities.

Abstract: In Viet Nam, standards of nursing care fail to meet international competency standards. This increases risks to patient safety ( eg. hospital acquired infection), consequently the Ministry of Health identified the need to strengthen nurse education in Viet Nam. This paper presents experiences of a piloted clinical teaching model developed in Ha Noi, to strengthen nurse led institutional capacity for inservice education and clinical teaching. Historically 90% of nursing education was conducted by physicians and professional development in hospitals for nurses was limited. There was minimal communication between hospitals and nursing schools about expectations of students and assessment and quality of the learning experience. As a result when students came to the clinical sites, no- one understood how to plan their learning objectives and utilise teaching and learning approaches appropriate to their level. Therefore student learning outcomes were variable. They focussed on procedures and techniques and " learning how to do" rather than learning how to plan, implement and evaluate patient care. This project is part of a multi- component capacity building program designed to improve nurse education in Viet Nam. The project was funded jointly by Queensland University of Technology ( QUT) and the Australian Agency for International Development. Its aim was to develop a collaborative clinically- based model of teaching to create an environment that encourages evidence- based, studentcentred clinical learning. Accordingly, strategies introduced promoted clinical teaching of competency based nursing practice utilising the regionally endorsed nurse core competency standards. Thirty nurse teachers from Viet Duc University Hospital and Hanoi Medical College participated in the program. These nurses and nurse teachers undertook face to face education in three workshops, and completed three assessment items. Assessment was applied, where participants integrated the concepts learned in each workshop and completed assessment tasks related to planning, implementing and evaluating teaching in the clinical area. Twenty of these participants were then selected to undertake a two week study tour in Brisbane, Australia where the clinical teaching model was refined and an action plan developed to integrate into both organisations with possible implementation across Viet Nam. Participants on this study tour also experienced clinical teaching and learning at QUT by attending classes held at the university, and were able to visit selected hospitals to experience clinical teaching in these settings as well. Effectiveness of the project was measured throughout the implementation phase and in follow up visits to the clinical site. To date changes have been noted on an individual and organisational level. There is also significant planning underway to incorporate the clinical teaching model developed across the organisation and how this may be implemented in other regions. Two participants have also been involved in disseminating aspects of this approach to clinical teaching in Ho Chi Minh, with further plans for more in- depth dissemination to occur throughout the country.

Abstract: This article explores how organizational policy capacity can be developed, drawing on a study conducted in a large human services agency in Australia. Building policy capacity within government agencies is widely acknowledged as important for successfully responding to complex policy problems. The existing literature suggests a range of strategies for building organizational capacity. Findings from interviews with policy workers support the principles for building policy capacity identified in the literature but uncovered a surprising degree of scepticism pointing to significant barriers to their realization. These barriers are identified as emerging out of the tensions between policy capacity and two other domains of governing capacity: administrative capacity and state capacity. These tensions however are highly contingent and dynamic; managing them requires a degree of discretion and judgement, in brief, policy leadership. A focus on developing policy leadership at the level of policy units and teams may present a strategic approach to building organizational capacity for policy work.

Abstract: The current fabric of urban areas is largely the result of past land development and land-use planning decisions. Historically, there was relatively little consideration of the impact of these decisions upon hydrological systems within and outside urban areas. Despite their close relationship, urban and regional planning and water resources management have typically been carried out separately and guided by different institutional arrangements. The range of impacts of urbanisation on hydrological systems at the city-region scale, and the dependence of urbanised areas upon these systems, call for better integration between the sectors of urban and regional planning and water resources management to ensure the sustainability and resilience of cities and their regions to future changes and uncertainties. This paper evaluates the extent to which planning mechanisms currently support integration between land-use and water resource sectors. The evaluation draws on a comparative analysis of 113 statutory and non-statutory planning mechanisms in three Australian capital city-regions: South East Queensland, and the Melbourne and Perth Metropolitan regions. Results indicate that the function of water at the city-region scale, including its role in supporting environmental connectivity, needs to be better understood and considered by land-use planning systems; improved institutional capacity is required to enable both sectors to deal with future changes and uncertainties related to water resources; and emergent planning trends supportive of the consideration of water connectivity at the city-region scale are yet to be fully implemented. Based on the results, the paper concludes by exploring how the concept of urban metabolism may facilitate better integration between the two sectors, along with the identification of best suited planning mechanisms and needed changes in governance and institutional arrangements conducive to integration.

Abstract: Public spaces are the loci of complex interactions among multiple stakeholders whose decisions and activities affect places' qualities. The paper builds upon governance theory to provide a holistic in-depth approach in understanding the complexity and quality of the place-shaping processes in public spaces. In the absence of adequate conception of governance in urban design and public spaces, the paper introduces a framework for analysing governance capacity of public spaces and applies the framework to a flagship but highly contested public space in Brisbane, Australia namely South Bank Parklands. The proposed framework encompasses four major components of 1) actors and stakeholders, 2) governance structure, 3) governing tools, and 4) governing tasks. The framework puts special emphasis on the contextual factors, the way public spaces are shaped and governed, and political economy of the space. The case study application showcases the applicability of the PSGF which helps holistically analyse the trends in public space governance structure accounting for the diversity and complexity of all elements involved. The findings reveal that South Bank Parklands governance is mix-structured, hierarchical, and highly political. It is, however, a likeable public space for which civic engagement in the decision-making processes is notably limited.

Abstract: Successful river basin governance is challenged by actor engagement in the various stages of planning and management. A governance approach for determining priorities for actors for sustainable management was developed, based on a river basin diagnostic framework consisting of four social-institutional and four biophysical indicators. It was applied in river basins in Australia, Brazil, China and France. Actors diagnosed current and target capacity for these indicators, and estimated synergistic influences of interacting indicators. The results reveal different priorities and transformative pathways to achieve basin plan outcomes, specific to each basin and actor groups. Priorities include biodiversity for the Murray-Darling, local water management needs for the Sao Francisco and Yellow rivers, and improved decision-making for the Adour-Garonne. This novel approach challenges entrenched views about key issues and actor engagement roles in co-implementation of the basin plan under existing prevailing governance models, with implications for engagement and international collaboration on basin governance.

Abstract: Previous studies pay a little attention to whether the differences in national governance quality between home and host country substantially affect foreign bank performance. Based on a bank panel data with 375 foreign banks in 47 Asian countries between 2004 and 2019, the impact of the host-home country difference in governance quality on foreign bank performance is empirically investigated by considering the degree of banking competition measured with the Boone index. Using a panel data model with multilevel mixed-effects, this paper finds that foreign banks in Asia present higher profits than domestic banks. Specifically, banks locating in a less competitive host nation show higher profitability, while host-home differences in aggregated quality of national governance also significantly reduce the foreign bank profitability in terms of individual indicator for voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. Finally, foreign banks could gauge their market power in a less competitive banking structure in the host country to mitigate the negative influence of national governance between host and home country on their financial performance.

Abstract: Financial development is an inclusive objective for economies worldwide, but its connection with natural resources remains a topic of debate. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the impact of the resourcecurse hypothesis on economic development in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries during the period 1996 to 2021, given their substantial natural resources. Employing a cross-sectional ARDL (CS-ARDL) framework and validating the cointegration results with the Pedroni, Westerlund, and Kao Cointegration tests, this research surprisingly challenges the conventional wisdom of the resource-curse hypothesis. Instead, it reveals that natural resource rents can be beneficial for promoting financial development in highincome resource-rich economies. Furthermore, the study uncovers positive associations between financial development and key factors such as government effectiveness, regulatory quality, renewable energy adoption, economic growth, and urbanization. The findings underscore the significance of strong institutional frameworks in fostering financial development and offer valuable policy recommendations to enhance financial progress in OPEC countries.

Abstract: Romania ranks at the extreme low end in Eastern Europe in terms of Hofstede cultural insights, rule of law, government effectiveness, and corruption-potentially limiting governance quality for restricting resource channeling. In this paper, we examine whether these shortcomings flow over into the degree of corporate insider trading profitability at the firm level. Consistent with high power distance, low individualism, and voice and accountability, executives and their family members extract higher returns. The conjectured monitoring constraint of equity ownership had little impact on reducing profitable trading. Second, media reporting of firm-related scandals only restrained insider profitability in firms with government ownership-consistent with general forbearance of corruption and sanction from the use of politically controlled assets. Third, the global financial crisis revealed both a crisis of inept trading consistent with high uncertainty avoidance and also highly profitable trades for a limited set of executives who undertook short-term reversal strategies. Our exploratory microanalysis suggests a prototype to highlight areas requiring governance and investor attention in Eastern European countries.

Abstract: The extent of the economic distance between a firm's home origin and its foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important strategic decision for the investing firm. This study fills an important knowledge gap by investigating the home institutional antecedents of FDI economic distance. Drawing insights from comparative institutionalism, we argue that home-country states vary in both their power to coordinate the economy and the external and internal channels through which they exercise that power. These variations have implications on a firm's motivation and capability to escape external dependencies on the home-country state by investing in economically distant foreign locations. Empirically, using a dataset of 891 new international entrants from 2004 to 2011, we found support for our hypotheses that home-country state power is positively associated with FDI economic distance, and that the influence of the home-country state is contingent on the state's governance quality and its ownership in firms.

Abstract: New public management (NPM) has been the dominant orthodoxy in analysing public service reform with major implications for employment relations. Drawing on comparative studies of major OECD countries, including Australia, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United States, this article examines recent reforms of public service human resource management. It refutes the proposition that reforms indicate convergence towards an NPM model and argues that the 'varieties of NPM' thesis is also unconvincing. Several reform trajectories exist which have sought to modernize public sector pay, performance and working conditions, but these highlight the existence of alternative models rather than a shift towards NPM or even the emergence of 'varieties of NPM'.

Abstract: Integration of climate change adaptation with development planning at multiple scales is widely seen as preferable to reactive, fragmented, or highly centralized responses. At the same time, there are growing concerns on when intervention is most appropriate, the transaction costs of coordination, and the adequacy of institutional capacity at local levels, especially in developing countries. This article examines entry points and mechanisms for integrating concerns with climate change into local development planning in Cambodia. An institutional ethnography of the planning process indicates that subnational planning is participatory and flexible; and thus, provides plausible entry points to integrate climate change concerns. Case study methods applied to two externally supported, climate-resilient development projects identify promising mechanisms and strategies, as well as obstacles to integration. A vulnerability reduction assessment tool and top-up grant scheme both included promising deliberative and participatory elements from which lessons for future and elsewhere can be drawn. At the same time, key stakeholders concede that local integration more widely is hampered by multiple obstacles, including weak institutional capacity, low community participation, and lack of resources and incentives. Addressing these challenges requires political commitments for good governance, capacity development, and additional resources.

Abstract: The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has over 100 million Ha of forest and has significant potential to benefit from these forests, including through REDD+ if they are managed effectively. Effective governance of forest landscapes is essential for environmental management and equitable harnessing of ecosystem service benefits for communities. Poor governance, political instability, and capacity limitations in the DRC are widely highlighted. However, there have been few, if any, attempts to evaluate forest governance in the DRC, especially at the community level. This paper reports a community-level evaluation of forest governance in the DRC, using a survey method. The results suggest that REDD+ projects have the ability to improve forest governance as perceived by the community. The research shows that building the right capacity, consulting and accessing the needs of the community and building long-term projects and partnerships a key success factors. These findings and the novel approach to supporting communities to evaluate their governance are applicable to similar community-level forest governance contexts.

Abstract: With inefficient bureaucratic institutions, the effects of laws are hard to assess and incompetent politicians may pass laws to build a reputation as skillful reformers. Since too many laws curtail bureaucratic efficiency, this mechanism can generate a steady state with Kafkaesque bureaucracy. Temporary surges in political instability heighten the incentives to overproduce laws and can shift the economy towards the Kafkaesque state. Consistent with the theory, after a surge in political instability in the early 1990s, Italy experienced a significant increase in the amount of poor-quality legislation and a decrease in bureaucratic efficiency.

Abstract: Until recently, standards to guide nursing education and practice in Vietnam were nonexistent. This paper describes the development and implementation of a clinical teaching capacity building project piloted in Hanoi, Vietnam. The project was part of a multi-component capacity building program designed to improve nurse education in Vietnam. Objectives of the project were to develop a collaborative clinically-based teaching model that encourages evidence-based, student-centred clinical learning. The model incorporated strategies to promote development of nursing practice to meet national competency standards. Thirty nurse teachers from two organisations in Hanoi participated in the program. These participants attended three workshops, and completed applied assessments, where participants implemented concepts from each workshop. The assessment tasks were planning, implementing and evaluating clinical teaching. On completion of the workshops, twenty participants undertook a study tour in Australia to refine the teaching model and develop an action plan for model implementation in both organisations, with an aim to disseminate the model across Vietnam. Significant changes accredited to this project have been noted on an individual and organisational level. Dissemination of this clinical teaching model has commenced in Ho Chi Minh, with further plans for more in-depth dissemination to occur throughout the country. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: In the Philippines, networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) are more complex than individual MPAs, primarily due to involvement of multiple governance units. Hence, there is a need to understand the influence of governance context of networks on management performance. We addressed this need indirectly by evaluating the participation of network members and the governance capacity of three MPA networks with varying sizes, histories, and compositions of local governments and constituencies. We defined participation as the involvement of local governments and other stakeholders in decision-making processes. We defined governance capacity as the ability to govern interactions of social, economic, and political processes and dynamics in a political unit. We used qualitative, semi-structured key informant interviews and focus group discussions to ascertain whether participation and governance capacity are influenced by network size, institutional arrangements, and social and political contexts. We found that the sizes of the MPA networks did not affect participation and governance capacity. Instead, participation and capacity were influenced by institutional arrangements and the socioeconomic and political contexts of the local governments involved. We found that less complicated network objectives and systems for engagement, more inclusive membership, better communication, incentive systems, and strong leadership enhanced participation and governance capacity.

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to identify the basis of regional competence in industry sectors that are not key performers at the national level. The paper examines the ICT sector in two regions: Dresden (Germany) and Adelaide (Australia). The performance of Australia and Germany in ICT is not high by OECD standards. However, both Dresden and Adelaide have some competence in parts of the ICT sector that departs from national patterns. In Dresden the development of the ICT sector is more advanced than in Adelaide. In both regions, there are distinctive institutional features and policies that explain the development of the ICT sector. Further, in Dresden, the state has coordinated the ICT sector within the regional space, giving focus to institutional strengths in research and training, such that it is possible to describe the institutional environment as 'thick and coherent'. As such, the regional space of Dresden has experienced an agglomeration of ICT and can be regarded as more successful than Adelaide, where institutions and state initiatives are fragmented and incoherent.

Abstract: Viewed as an economic long march from poverty to middle-income status, China's four decades of rapid economic growth can seem little short of miraculous. Unsurprisingly, such a record is bound to inspire imitators, and China's political-economic model of authoritarian capitalism or state-sponsored neoliberalism has attracted many admirers in Africa. But viewed as a rapid rebound after the removal of catastrophic Maoist economic mismanagement, China's growth spurt has done little more than bring China up to the level of other semiperipheral countries in Asia, the post-Soviet space, and Latin America. China's economy rapidly grew to a level commensurate with its state capacity, and it is now leveling out at that level. The low levels of state capacity that have historically prevented most African countries from reaching middle-income levels of GDP per capita still prevail, and until these change, African countries will not be able to follow China into middle-income status.

Abstract: Over the past two millennia successful pre-modern states in Eurasia adopted and cultivated Big-God religions that emphasize (i) the ruler's legitimacy as divinely ordained and (ii) a morality adapted for large-scale societies that can have positive economic effects. We make sense of that development by building on previous research that has conceptualized pre-modern states as maximizing the ruler's profit. We model the interaction of rulers and subjects who have both material and psychological payoffs, the latter emanating from religious identity. Overall, religion reduces the cost of controlling subjects through the threat of violence, increases production, increases tax revenue, and reduces banditry. A Big-God ruler, who also is a believer, has stronger incentives to invest in expanding the number of believers and the intensity of belief, as well as investing in state capacity. Furthermore, such investments often are complementary, mutually reinforcing one another, thus leading to an evolutionary advantage for rulers that adopted Big-God religions.

Abstract: For reporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2004, Australian companies were required to disclose the expected impact of applying Australian equivalents of International Financial Reporting Standards effective from 1 January 2005. The objective of this paper is to examine the association between the level of disclosure and corporate governance quality. Using a sample of listed companies with 30 June balance dates, we find that the quantity of disclosure was positively related to some aspects of superior corporate governance, such as the frequency of board and audit committee meetings and the choice of auditor.

Abstract: In an international setting of developing countries, applying advanced statistical estimation approaches such as the system generalized method of moments (GMM), two-stage least square (2SLS) regressions, and cluster analysis, this paper revisits the impact of macro-level governance quality and the corruption index on the economic growth rate. We use cross-country panel data for 40 sub-Saharan and the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries over the period of 2009-2020. The empirical results document the positive and negative effects of the national governance index and the corruption index on the economic growth rate. Additionally, foreign direct investment and population have a positive impact on the economic growth rate and trade openness has a negative impact. The study evaluates the robustness of these associations through a series of tests. These findings have important policy implications for policymakers and regulators in developing countries. In particular, the study recommends the implementation of an anti-corruption campaign and improving country-level governance quality that could encourage increased foreign direct investment for an accelerated economic growth rate. These will further enhance accountability, transparency, the rule of law, social responsibility, the public voice, and government effectiveness.

Abstract: The study reported herein examines the impact of two central corporate governance mechanisms (internal audit function quality and board of directors' quality) on the incidence of earnings management. Unlike most prior studies in the area, focused mainly on US firms, this study looks at European firms that are cross-listed in the US and covers a long time span - before and after major changes were implemented in corporate governance policies (Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US and the 8th Company Law Directive in the European Union). Using novel and comprehensive measurement approaches for internal audit function quality and board of directors' quality, we find that both mechanisms have a negative direct effect on the incidence of earnings management, while their interactive effect is positive. A longitudinal analysis of both mechanisms also reveals that internal audit function quality and the quality of boards of directors have increased significantly since the policy changes.

Abstract: How do some places with weak institutional capacity avoid being caught in the cycles of violence and criminality so often associated with African institutions in the failed states' literature? This paper exploits in-country variation in piracy incidence across different regions of Somalia to investigate how some territories with low state capacity can nonetheless deter piracy and provide relative order. We find that the usual explanation - state failure' in Somalia, compared with a reasonably functional government in Somaliland - does not withstand scrutiny. Somaliland's lack of piracy was not due to strong' state institutions, but can be attributed to the strength of a discourse that emphasises Somaliland's inherent' capacity for order against the disorder supposedly endemic to the rest of Somalia. The exploration of the discursive underpinnings of Somaliland's supposed piratelessness' has implications for understanding the relationship between state institutions, political order and violence, particularly where the state does not exercise a monopoly on force.

Abstract: The policy problems posed by a lack of state capacity in developing societies now attract the attention of a growing number of scholars. Both the government failure paradigm, with its "top-down" emphasis, and the social capital theory, with its stress on "bottom-up" approaches, provide analytical frameworks that can be used to comprehend the symptoms of state incapacity reported by the much broader literature on policy implementation. This paper seeks to determine the implications of the government failure and social capital models for policy implementation. More specifically, the paper considers the contractualist approach to public management reform in New Zealand as the epitome of a top-down solution to government failure. it will also evaluate this model from a social capital perspective and suggest ways in which a balanced approach to public sector reform can take into account elements of both paradigms.

Abstract: The concept of infrastructural power is arguably one of the most useful in the social sciences. It has helped both to illuminate the extraordinary capacity, reach, and impact of the modern state vis-a-vis its pre-industrial predecessor, and to cast light on why some modern states appear more able than others to execute their decisions and pursue their ambitions. Although sometimes mischaracterized as a 'weak' state, the capacity of the state centered on Washington to penetrate social space and implement its decisions, both at home and abroad, has long been recognized. But under what conditions might its infrastructural power diminish? Arguably, US economic power is now stronger than ever, ostensibly bolstered by being home to the world's most globalized and most profitable companies. However, while globalized production has strengthened US corporations - especially those rich in intellectual property - its contradictory consequences for the state's infrastructural power deserve close examination. This paper takes a first step in that direction by appraising the extent to which the state's domestic capacities have been weakened by Washington's internationalization of intellectual property rights. It also offers a reconceptualization of US power.

Abstract: This article analyses the redistributive efficiency of social transfers and direct taxation in a panel of 28 developed economies during the period 1995-2010. In order to explore how redistribution is achieved through these fiscal policies, a two-stage approach is applied. First, we evaluate their redistributive efficiency - the degree of redistribution attained for a given level of transfers and taxes - using data envelopment analysis (DEA). We find lower redistributive efficiency in Southern Europe and the United States and higher efficiency levels in the Nordic and Central European countries and Australia. Second, we use panel regression analysis to identify the determinants of efficiency differences and reveal the crucial role of government quality as well as factors affecting the redistributive profile of fiscal policies.

Abstract: The study examines the effect of compliance with national governance frameworks on the relationship between corporate governance and the performance of publicly traded companies in Ghana. A sample of 31 companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange was drawn for the study based on their annual reports spanning from 2013 to 2022. A new national governance quality index composed of items drawn from world governance indicators and a corporate governance index was developed by principal component analysis. The study used the Huber M-estimation Robust Least Squares (HMRLS) regression method. The findings of our study reveal that corporate governance practices adversely affect the level of firm performance. However, our results demonstrate that compliance with national governance and institutional frameworks plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. The study offers managerial implications, as listed firms can adopt effective national governance and institutional quality practices to improve firm performance. This study investigates the relationship between corporate governance and business performance in Ghana, with a special focus on determining whether adherence to national governance frameworks has a significant impact. This research enhances the current understanding of corporate governance in Ghana and its impact on the performance of companies. This study offers useful information to policymakers, regulators, and business organisations in Ghana. This will result in improved corporate practices and greater performance of companies in Ghana. It will further aid stakeholders' comprehension of the significance of complying with national governance frameworks. Ultimately, the findings in this research would promote a culture of transparency, responsibility, and ethical behaviour in the business industry. This would enhance the overall economic progress and investor confidence in Ghana.

Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of CEO incentive-based compensation on earnings management, taking into account the influence of institutional settings and corporate governance systems. Design/methodology/approach - Using archival data of 3,000 British, Australian, German, and Austrian firm-years between 2005 and 2014, the study applies fixed-effect estimator to reduce risks of endogeneity bias. Findings - The findings reveal that institutional factors influence the relationship between CEO incentive-based compensation and earnings management. Particularly, firms from countries within the Anglo-American model (the UK and Australia), which provide greater protection for investor, stricter legal enforcement, and higher quality of corporate governance, tend to have lower level of earnings management. However, besides corporate governance quality, it is relevant to consider weaker investor protection and legal enforcement to motivate earnings management in firms from countries within the Euro-Continental model (Germany and Austria). Originality/value - The study suggests that robust implementation of corporate governance, derived from either model, helps in restraining CEO opportunistic behavior. Importantly, more qualified institutions have higher impact on the relative adequacy of CEO incentive-based pay formulas in mitigating earnings management concerns. This can be extended by future research through comparative studies using other contexts or influential institutions.

Abstract: The schools of government perform a central role to the public service of many countries. Despite being a disseminated and well-established phenomenon, the functions and even the concept of schools of government vary. Aiming to portray the functions and characteristics of schools of government around the world and offer a better understanding of them, this paper presents a comparative study of schools of government located across six continents. Based on purposive sampling, eight schools of government were selected to be part of this in depth study: Ecole Nationale d'Administration, ENA - France; Canada School of Public Service, CSPS - Canada; Instituto Nacional de la Administracion Publica, I NAP - Argentina; Australia and New Zealand School of Government, ANZSOG - Australia and New Zealand; Civil Service College, CSC - Singapore; National School of Government, NSG - South Africa; Direccao Geral da Qualificagao dos Trabalhadores em Fungoes Publicas, INA - Portugal; and Escuela Superior de Administracion Publica, ESAP - Colombia. Data collection procedures included interviews and document analysis. Data were analyzed using content and comparative analysis. This study highlights some important dimensions of schools of government including the position within the government, funding, main activities, organizational structure and personnel. Other similarities (e.g. among members of Commonwealth) and possible common trends and innovation challenges are also discussed. Finally, we discuss the results comparing them to previous studies findings.

Abstract: Fisheries have had major negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and effective fisheries management and governance are needed to achieve sustainable fisheries, biodiversity conservation goals and thus good ecosystem status. To date, the IndiSeas programme (Indicators for the Seas) has focussed on assessing the ecological impacts of fishing at the ecosystem scale using ecological indicators. Here, we explore fisheries Management Effectiveness' and Governance Quality' and relate this to ecosystem health and status. We developed a dedicated expert survey, focused at the ecosystem level, with a series of questions addressing aspects of management and governance, from an ecosystem-based perspective, using objective and evidence-based criteria. The survey was completed by ecosystem experts (managers and scientists) and results analysed using ranking and multivariate methods. Results were further examined for selected ecosystems, using expert knowledge, to explore the overall findings in greater depth. Higher scores for Management Effectiveness' and Governance Quality' were significantly and positively related to ecosystems with better ecological status. Key factors that point to success in delivering fisheries and conservation objectives were as follows: the use of reference points for management, frequent review of stock assessments, whether Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catches were being accounted for and addressed, and the inclusion of stakeholders. Additionally, we found that the implementation of a long-term management plan, including economic and social dimensions of fisheries in exploited ecosystems, was a key factor in successful, sustainable fisheries management. Our results support the thesis that good ecosystem-based management and governance, sustainable fisheries and healthy ecosystems go together.

Abstract: As rock bursts are unavoidable in deep mines and excavations with high in-situ stresses, ground support systems are implemented to manage and mitigate rock bursts. Cable bolts are commonly used as reinforcing elements in ground support systems, which are subject to dynamic loads in burst-prone excavations. To design an efficient cable bolt in burst-prone conditions, shear and energy absorption capacity must be considered. Numerical modelling is an advantageous method of repeatable testing and it is inexpensive and non-destructive. This study develops a statically and dynamically loaded numerical model of a double shear test in ABAQUS/Explicit. A total of 36 static and 576 dynamic tests are carried out, which examine the influence of bolt diameter, steel yield and ultimate strength, dynamic load velocity and dynamic load mass on the displacement, shear force and energy absorption capacity of cable bolts. As bolt diameter and steel yield strength increases, the maximum shear force resisted and bolt displacement increases. Similarly, as the mass and velocity of the dynamic load increases, the amount of energy absorbed by the cable bolt increases. The main novelty of the current research is to suggest a reliable computational tool to investigate the influence of the different key parameters in the cable bolts on the ultimate capacity. The suggested method is a significantly cost-effective technique compared with the experimental investigations.

Abstract: Local government in Australia has a strong collective capacity to reduce GHG emissions through policies, funding allocation to renewable energy projects and the delivery of programs and services. This study examines the institutional capacity of councils in Sydney and how this impacts on decisions to invest in alternative energy projects. We find greenhouse gas emission targets of councils are strongly aligned to national targets but do not reflect the local council's institutional capacity, political leadership or strategic priorities. Energy reduction projects are often identified and undertaken by environmental staff without support from financial staff or financial-evaluation tools. An absence of national guidelines to provide consistency in tracking and reporting limits cross-sector benchmarking. Street lighting contributes to a significant proportion of council's total electricity expenditure and GHG emission profile. Being highly regulated, existing contracts and the current practice of street lighting services limits the councils' ability to reduce emissions. Based on our analysis we recommend a number of measures to overcome these constraints including the use of financial evaluation tools for small-scale renewable energy projects, a standardised national tracking and reporting platform to facilitate progress-reporting and meaningful comparative analysis between councils and policy reform to the regulation of street lighting.

Abstract: This article assesses the relative merits of the reversal of fortune thesis, according to which the most politically and economically advanced polities of the precolonial era were subject to institutional reversal by European colonial powers, and the persistence of fortune view, according to which early advantages in state formation persisted throughout and beyond the colonial era. Discussing the respective arguments, the article offers a synthesis: the effect of early state formation on development trajectories was subject to a threshold condition. Non-European states at the highest levels of precolonial political centralization were able to resist European encroachment and engage in defensive modernization, whereas states closest to, yet just below, this threshold were the most attractive targets for colonial exploitation. Since the onset of decolonization, however, such polities have been among the first to regain independence and world patterns of state capacity are increasingly reverting to those of the precolonial era.

Abstract: Harvest strategies, also referred to as management procedures, are foundational to evidence-based fisheries decision making. Together with closed-loop simulation testing, termed Management Strategy Evaluation, of potential harvest strategies, they are considered to be best practice. However, the use of these approaches is still mostly limited to a small minority of high-value, data-rich stocks in developed economies. The Indonesian tropical tuna fisheries provide a rare real-world experience where formal empirical harvest strategies were being developed for data-limited fisheries within a developing economy as an operational management tool. The Harvest Strategy Framework is a departure from a previously open-access fishery for tropical tuna in Indonesian archipelagic waters. It outlines the necessary actions to operationalize the harvest strategy, including fisheries monitoring, harvest control rules, associated management measures to meet the management objectives, and immediate actions to reduce the levels of catch as a precautionary measure until the harvest strategy is fully implemented. It was developed over a 9-year national consultative process, commencing in 2014 and culminating in the official adoption of the framework in June 2023. This paper outlines key processes and challenges encountered in stakeholder engagement and technical capacity development within the intricate governance context of Indonesia. We argue that the engagement processes have cemented a future direction towards sustainable and best practice fisheries management in Indonesia and the effective co-production process has potential to show the way for other fisheries in coastal developing states who face similar challenges in managing their national and internationally shared stocks.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that democratic governments listen to their populations, while authoritarian governments do not. This paper questions the extent to which this dynamic applies in cases of government scandals, using the illustrative cases of China and Kenya. We expect democratic countries with free media to be responsive and authoritarian states to ignore public pressure. Counter to this expectation, however, authoritarian China is more responsive to public pressure to clean up scandals than democratic Kenya. Using case studies and quantitative analysis, we argue that while democracy and free media are important for government responsiveness to scandal, they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions. We assert that political will, state capacity to respond and high public expectations for state action are also necessary.

Abstract: Surveillance infrastructure in China monitors and enables authorities to react to potential risky, miscreant or criminal behaviour. What type of behaviours are perceived to be so, is determined in large part by ideology. Therefore, surveillance infrastructure relies on the machinery of ideology to define the boundaries of its use. In this paper, we outline six key ideological concepts relating to governance in Xi Jinping's China that have helped to expand the boundaries of surveillance. We identify terms embedded in promotional material of Hikvision and other surveillance technology firms as a springboard for conceptual discussion. The aim is to survey the ideological lexicon of concepts that position surveillance within the Party-state's broad capacity-building ambitions for governance in Xi's China. This positioning amplifies the political responsibility of state, social and market actors to work together to broaden surveillance activities for 'society-building' purposes, and ultimately for the realisation of Xi Jinping's goal of National Rejuvenation.

Abstract: Governing norms by which to steer traditional government functions are well established and understood; however, this is not the case for the new multi-level and collaborative approaches that characterize protected area governance. This is largely new territory that makes novel demands on governance institutions and policy. In this context, establishing and maintaining good governance across the diversity of ownership and responsibility arrangements is critical for the future effectiveness and acceptability of protected areas. Fulfilling the promise and avoiding the pitfalls inherent in contemporary protected area governance will require an understanding of what is meant by 'good governance' and development of associated mechanisms to assess performance and provide a basis for improvement. This paper's contribution lies in the guidance it provides for the hitherto under-developed area of governance quality assessment. I first present a framework that positions governance quality in relation to governance and management effectiveness. I then characterize good protected area governance according to a set of seven principles - legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, connectivity and resilience. Together, the framework, governance principles and related performance outcomes provide a platform for assessment of governance quality for an individual terrestrial protected area, a network of several protected areas, or a national protected area system.

Abstract: Vietnamese 'blue boats' - small wooden-hulled fishing boats - are now entering the territorial waters of Pacific Island countries and illegally catching high-value species found on remote coastal reefs. Crossing several international boundaries and traversing a distance of over 5000 km, these intrusions have alarmed Oceanic countries, including Australia. Lacking administrative capacity as well as jurisdictional authority to effectively control the vast stretches of island coastlines individually, governments and intergovernmental bodies in the region have called for strengthened coordination of surveillance efforts while also pressuring Vietnam diplomatically. This paper reviews these latest developments and is the first to provide a focused assessment of the issue. Through the lens of Copenhagen School of securitisation theory, we analyse responses of national and regional actors and their portrayal in online media to understand how blue boats are constructed as a security threat within a narrative of maritime, food and human security. Arguably, Australia together with the Forum Fisheries Agency, who advise on the governance of offshore tuna resources, have so far acted most decisively - in a way that might see them extend their strategic role in the region. We propose a comprehensive empirical research agenda to better understand and manage this nascent, flammable and largely unpredictable inter-regional phenomenon.

Abstract: Canonical theories of bureaucracy demonstrate the need for enhanced monitoring in government hierarchies. I argue that intensive top-down monitoring may reduce the productivity of bureaucrats by frightening them away from the informal practices that they would otherwise rely on when completing daily tasks. Utilizing a unique dataset of sub-provincial inspections in China's recent anti-corruption campaign, I identify this "chilling effect" by exploiting variation in the timing of inspections from 2012 to 2017. I show that these anti-corruption activities lower the area of land development projects proposed by bureaucrats. Causal mediation analyses with investigation data and original measures of corruption potential reveal that these effects are unlikely driven by reduction of actual corruption. Extension analyses suggest similar consequences on revenue collection and environmental regulation. Although scholars of state-building equate low corruption with effective bureaucracy, these findings present a paradox where intensive state-led efforts to lower corruption may further undermine bureaucrats' productivity.

Abstract: Capacity building efforts in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are indispensable for the achievement of both individual and collective ocean-related 2030 agenda priorities for sustainable development. Knowledge of the individual capacity building and research infrastructure requirements in SIDS is necessary for national and international efforts to be effective in supporting SIDS to address nationally-identified sustainable development priorities. Here, we present an assessment of human resources and institutional capacities in SIDS United Nations (UN) Member States to help formulate and implement durable, relevant, and effective capacity development responses to the most urgent marine issues of concern for SIDS. The assessment highlights that there is only limited, if any, up-to-date information publicly available on human resources and research capacities in SIDS. A reasonable course of action in the future should, therefore, be the collection and compilation of data on educational, institutional, and human resources, as well as research capacities and infrastructures in SIDS into a publicly available database. This database, supported by continued, long-term international, national, and regional collaborations, will lay the foundation to provide accurate and up-to-date information on research capacities and requirements in SIDS, thereby informing strategic science and policy targets towards achieving the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) within the next decade.

Abstract: This paper examines the structures of capitalism in Southeast Asia. Following the lead of Gordon Redding and others, it argues that parallel to varieties of capitalism elsewhere, there are distinctive features to the Southeast Asian business system, but that institutions play a relatively large role compared to firm specific resources or industry structures. Historically, with the exception of Thailand all the countries in the region are former colonies. All including Thailand share a distinctive style of nationalism, and partly as a result of this, all are governed by states that claim to be strong and lay wide claims but whose capacities are low. Typical features of the region, particularly the roles of large business groups and the Chinese minority, also can be interpreted as a result of this history. One of the outcomes of the analysis is an extension of the varieties of capitalism approach along the dimensions of state capacity and state direction, and of the approach to the internationalizing firm along the dimensions of dynamic capacity and control of subsidiaries. A further outcome is a questioning of the traditional picture of indigenous Southeast Asian business people as lacking in entrepreneurial skills, or more broadly of Southeast Asian nations as lacking in entrepreneurial values. Rather, the past history of these countries has resulted in a set of structures that militate against successful entrepreneurial activity.

Abstract: Objectives Diabetic eye disease is a leading cause of blindness but can be mitigated by regular eye assessment. A framework of issues, developed from the literature of barriers to eye assessment, was used to structure an examination of perceptions of a new model of care for diabetic retinopathy from the perspective of staff using the model, and health professionals referring patients to the new service. Design Multimethod: interviews and focus groups, and a separate survey. Setting A new clinic based on an integrated model of care was established at a hospital in outer metropolitan Sydney, Australia in 2017. Funded jointly by Centre for Eye Health (CFEH) and the hospital, the clinic was equipped and staffed by optometrists who work alongside the ophthalmologists in the existing hospital eye clinic. Participants Five (of seven) hospital staff working in the clinic (ophthalmologists and administrative officers) or referring to it from other departments (endocrinologists); nine optometrists from CFEH who developed or worked in the clinic; 10 community-based optometrists as potential referrers. Results The new clinic was considered to have addressed known barriers to eye assessment, including access, assistance for patients unable/unwilling to organise eye checks and efficient management of human resources. The clinic optimised known drivers of this model of care: providing clear scope of practice and protocols for shared care between optometrists and ophthalmologists, good communication between referrers and eye professionals and a collegial approach promoting interprofessional trust. Remaining areas of concern were few referrals from general practitioners, fewer referrals from hospital endocrinologists than expected and issues with stretched administrative capacity. There were also perceived mismatches between the priorities of hospital management and aims of the clinic. Conclusions The new model was considered to have addressed many of the barriers to assessment. While there remain issues with the model, there were also unexpected benefits.

Abstract: For Tasmanians accessing Government services has traditionally required visits to various Lead Agency locations, as service delivery was fragmented and bureaucratic. The Tasmanian Government adopted a customer-focused approach implementing 'Service Tasmania' a One-Stop-Shop service delivery concept. This paper investigates what led to the success of this public service reform and in particular what change management practices were applied during the change effort. Ten common factors of successful change have been identified in the literature; these are explored determining their relevance throughout this initiative. Data were collected with semi-structured interviews conducted with 63 staff plus senior management. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach and open coding was applied during the first pass through the data to reach the initial codes identifying critical terms and generic key issues. Findings confirm that several management interventions were necessary to address resistance and conflict issues and keep the government reform project on track.

Abstract: This report examines the conditions of appointment and termination of departmental secretaries in the APS and considers the impact of these conditions on: the secretaries themselves; the potential pool from which secretaries are drawn, and the likely continuing influence on the way in which the APS operates. The report is based on reviews of the literature on the appointments of departmental secretaries and of the legislative changes made in the last decades. It also draws from a series of interviews with 20 past and present secretaries. The interviews were conducted in October and December 1996, after a number of secretaries had been terminated by the new government but in most cases before the government paper on public service reform was released. The report is divided into two main sections. the first section analyses the changing conditions of service and tenure, the appointment and termination of secretaries and pay and conditions, the second section analyses the impact of the changes under three headings and explores the future implications.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how local government bodies in Nepal are empowered to play their constitutional roles and engage in activities to deliver public services at the doorsteps of the people effectively. The focus is on the institutionalisation of federalism, its implications for local governance, and capacity development of local authorities. Design/methodology/approach Ideas of decentralisation, governance and public management have been used to interpret findings based on qualitative research methods by key informant interviews, focus group discussions and personal observations conducted in five selected municipalities in Nepal. Findings The process of operationalising the power of local government bodies is more conventional and hierarchic. At the same time, the formulation and implementation of inclusive plans and budgeting are confined with certain formalities that do not necessarily allow citizens the space for voices. Federal government grants constrain fiscal jurisdiction and control over resource mobilisation. The mere preparation and administration of local government legislation and relevant by-laws have weakened the capacity of local government bodies. Originality/value From interpretation of first-hand data, this paper has identified the pitfalls of the federalisation process, the constraints deter the devolution of power to local bodies as well as the transformation of local governments into autonomous institutions in Nepal.

Abstract: Reform of the public service has not been just some management fad, nor is it even driven by purely management considerations. Fundamentally, public service reform, both in the last decade and in the future, is being driven by basic changes in our society, economy and technology which in turn influence what the public expects from government. The reforms of she last decade or so have concentrated on changing the management framework and culture. Future reforms are likely to impact more heavily on the responsibilities of the APS and what it actually does. However, the underlying rationale will continue to be to ensure the delivery of services which respond more effectively to the needs of the community.

Abstract: This study examines the role of resource abundance in the cross-country differences in the impacts of the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009. Using forecasts from the unobserved components model and exponential smoothing technique, we estimate the output levels a country would reach in 2009 and 2013 in the absence of the GFC, and compare these with the realised output levels. We find large variations in the output losses across 72 countries. The mineral-rich countries have been found to be in a strong position to survive any adverse shocks stemming from the GFC. Income per capita, trade openness, and institutional quality and government effectiveness are also found to be key factors determining the differences in output loss in the post-crisis period. These findings have strong implications for resource-rich countries such as Australia and are expected to shed new light on alternative policy designs and appropriate strategies to deal with any future economic crisis.

Abstract: This study examines whether the effectiveness of board subcommittees is associated with director attrition and the attraction of new directors to boards. Using a sample of firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, we find that nomination and remuneration committee effectiveness is inversely associated with director attrition and positively related to new external directors joining boards. The results suggest the contribution of these subcommittees to improve corporate governance by strengthening the board's human capital through recruitment and retention of suitable talent. Furthermore, the influence of subcommittee effectiveness on attrition (attraction) is more pronounced in firms experiencing higher levels of information asymmetry, weaker governance quality and poorer performance. The results are robust to tests with alternative variables, entropy balanced matching, and additional controls. Overall, our findings show that improved governance through effective subcommittees helps maintain and enhance the human capital of boards.

Abstract: Since the 1980s, globalization and its effects on development in Kenya have had mixed returns; key among them was an accelerated momentum to recognize citizen contribution to planning for their development and also citizen involvement in resource mobilization for development. In this regard, the country adopted policies which included decentralized development through the District Focus for Rural Development, introduction of cost-sharing in the Education and Health sector, among other initiatives. In the 1990s, the Kenya government implemented another wave of reform driven by global realities of concern for increased development funding matched with decreasing wage bill. Actions towards reducing the wage bill included public service staff reductions and payroll cleansing especially in local authorities. One of the key lessons from these reform approaches was that, without elaborate stakeholder involvement and ownership of the development agenda, the reform initiatives were achieving negligible returns to development. Consequently, the next phase of reforms started in 2003 focused primarily on citizen engagement, public private sector partnerships and civil society active participation in reforms targeting the key pillars of public administration in Kenya, namely: (1) Institutional strengthening across the public sector (2) Governance, law and Order (3) Information management (4) Public Service accountability to citizens (5) Strengthening Public Sector Integrity (6) Political restructuring through new constitutional dispensation (7) Public Private sector congruence for development The experiences, successes and challenges realized in these new reform initiatives shall be the focus of my paper. In particular, I shall provide personal insights based on my experience as a public administrator, public officer, researcher, trainer and consultant in public administration, management and leadership. For over 20 years, I have lived the reform waves in Kenya and can witness how increased citizen participation in the governance of states must be the norm if countries are to develop faster and relevantly. The paper shall discuss different methods of citizen and stakeholder engagement that works and the challenges inherent; in addition the paper shall review Kenyan experience in involving private sector players to strengthen public service administration and management especially in the last decade.

Abstract: The issue of why so many young adolescents around the world are disengaging from school and making the choice to drop out is one of the most intractable, vexed, perplexing, and controversial issues confronting educators. Tackling it requires courage and a radical rethinking of school reform around issues of power, ownership of learning, and the relevance of schooling and curriculum for young lives. This means a heightened institutional capacity to "listen." This article describes an instance of a disadvantaged urban Australian government school that realized it had little alternative but to try new approaches; "old ways" were not working. The article describes an ensemble of school reform practices, philosophies, and strategies that give young adolescents genuine ownership of their learning. This school stands out as a beacon that school reform is possible, even for young adolescents from the most difficult of circumstances. However, such approaches look markedly different from where mainstream educational reform is taking us at the moment.

Abstract: Several recent works have emphasised new relations of hierarchy within international society, primarily involving the claim by certain Western states of the authority to intervene in particular territories in order to build state capacity and the institutions of sound liberal democratic governance. While several scholars have identified these new hierarchies, few have provided a satisfactory account of what informs their formation and reproduction. This article investigates why new hierarchies have emerged within international society, arguing that they are underpinned by a 'liberal social logic of risk', which simultaneously constructs liberal democracies as inherently peaceful and prosperous and non-liberal or weak states as inherently risky and dangerous. Confronted by new forms of debounded security risks, Western societies have sought to manage these risks via interventions in identified 'risky zones' aimed at building liberal political and economic institutions. This argument is illustrated by the example of Australia's new interventionist development agenda in the Asia-Pacific, notably its leading role in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). This interventionist agenda is, in effect, a new mechanism of regional risk management that informs new modes of hierarchical governance in the Asia-Pacific.

Abstract: Africa is on the verge of a mining boom. We review the environmental threats from African mining development, including habitat alteration, infrastructure expansion, human migration, bushmeat hunting, corruption, and weak governance. We illustrate these threats in Central Africa, which contains the vast Congo rainforest, and show that more than a quarter of 4,151 recorded mineral occurrences are concentrated in three regions of biological endemismthe Cameroon-Gabon Lowlands, Eastern DRC Lowlands, and Albertine Rift Mountainsand that most of these sites are currently unprotected. Threats are not uniform spatially, and much of the Congo Basin is devoid of mineral occurrences and may be spared from direct mining impacts. Some of the environmental impacts of African mining development could potentially be offset: mining set-asides could protect some wildlife habitats, whereas improving transportation networks could increase crop yields and spare land for conservation. Research and policy measures are needed to (1) understand the synergies between mining and other development activities, (2) improve environmental impact assessments, (3) devise mitigation and offsetting mechanisms, and (4) identify market choke points where lobbying can improve environmental practice. Without careful management, rapid mining expansion and its associated secondary effects will have severe impacts on African environments and biodiversity.

Abstract: We survey the recent economics and history literature on the Chinese state to investigate its role in China's long-term socioeconomic development. We highlight three insights. First, unlike in Europe, where interstate competition helped give rise to capitalist states with high capacity, the Chinese state emerged from a different historical context. Second, the 18th- and 19th-century Chinese state does not fit into the mould of a strong and extractive Oriental despotic state as once commonly believed. By conventional measures, early modern China had a weak state. Third, state building and centre-local relations are two useful dimensions to understand development and change in China's recent history and political economy. To adapt China to a changing world, Chinese state builders embarked on a long process of state building from the late-19th century through the Republican and Communist eras. Facilitated partly by regional decentralisation, the process now sees the Chinese state playing a substantially larger role in the economy and everyday life than any previous time in history.

Abstract: Water markets have featured prominently in the reallocation of water rights to restore freshwater ecosystem health. incentive-based water rights acquisition and transactions have emerged as a market-oriented policy approach to reallocate water resources from existing uses to enhance the provision, regulation, and sustainability of freshwater ecosystem services. This paper develops a conceptual framework to examine factors enabling and constraining successful policy reform and implementation in market-based environmental water allocation. This analysis distills and extends the findings and lessons of a September 2007 workshop in Brisbane, Australia on environmental water transactions. Two case studies were selected in water stressed basins - the Columbia (U.S.A) and Murray-Darling (Australia) Basins - where transactional approaches to environmental water allocation first emerged. The case studies draw upon practitioner perspectives and previous policy and economic analysis in two regions where shared political economic and physical conditions lend a strong analytical basis for comparison. A common set of policy and regulatory reforms has occurred in both cases - albeit in different forms and via distinct paths - to develop three enabling conditions: (1) establishment of rights to and limits on freshwater extraction and alteration; (2) recognition of the environment as a legitimate water use; and (3) authority to transfer existing water rights to an environmental purpose. However, these elements of policy reform are necessary but not sufficient for effective implementation; a second set of driving forces, barriers, and adaptations explains the ability to achieve larger scale ecological outcomes. These conditions include the physical, social and economic factors driving demand for environmental water allocation: administrative procedures, organizational development and institutional capacity to effect transfers; and adaptive mechanisms to overcome legal, cultural, economic, and environmental barriers. The case study analysis suggests that environmental water transactions can play an important role in establishing environmental water allocations, although water markets require ongoing institutional capacity and adaptive governance. The conceptual framework and empirical lessons generated through this cross-case comparison provide the basis for an expanded research agenda to evaluate the design and performance of market-oriented reforms as implementation experience accrues and new programs emerge in diverse ecological and political economic settings.

Abstract: Aims To explore and identify the core elements of the nurse executive role and the contribution these posts make to health service organisations in terms of quality and performance. Background With the ongoing global reform of health services and, in particular, currently in Australia, this commentary paper explores the available evidence that explains and describes the role that nursing leaders can and do play at executive level in enabling quality services in high performing health-care organisations. Evaluation While the overall literature is limited in relation to the role and function of nurse executives, there are strong and recurrent themes indicating that nurses by virtue of their professional background and experience can provide effective and influential input to executive boards. Executive nurses are well positioned to influence and lead professional governance, quality improvement, service transformation and change and shared governance. Conclusion At a time when the role of nursing executives may be questioned, the evidence supports the positive impact of highly skilled nursing executives in contributing to the implementation of effective health services. Successful health services should be engaging nurse executives who have the high level of expertise, education, the best leadership and management attributes to bring the art and science of nursing to produce outcomes for organisations. Implications for nursing management Nurse executives must remain alert to the ongoing challenges and potential questioning on the value that nurses can bring to an executive board. The framework of nursing executive influence and leadership through professional governance, quality improvement, service transformation and change and shared governance is one possible approach that nurse executives may wish to apply to articulate their contribution and value in remaining at the executive board table.

Abstract: The increasing global demand for critical minerals, driven by the energy transition and digitisation, can be a double-edged sword for resource-rich African countries (RRACs). While these countries possess abundant reserves of these minerals, they face a critical decision point. They must adapt their policies to leverage these resources for economic development in a rapidly changing landscape, at the same time balancing national interests with global call for decarbonisation. Simultaneously, the global shift towards renewable energy sources threatens to diminish the market for coal and gas resources, which are abundant in RRACs but underutilised. While this necessitates swift policy and strategic actions to facilitate resource utilisation for economic diversification, RRACs may find themselves in a race against time. Using insights from multi-stakeholder interviews and existing literature, this paper explores avenues for RRACs to industrialise and diversify their economies. The analysis underscores the significance of mineral and revenue utilisation; public-private collaboration; and regional strategies in investment, and supply and value chains for economic diversification in the context of energy transition.

Abstract: Terrorism is pervasive in Mali. The efforts by Mali to counter terrorism, however, have been inadequate. The lack of institutional capacity and the lack of a workable counterterrorism policy characterised by bad governance are identified as key inadequacies in the fight against terrorism in Mali. In view of these inadequacies, the article demonstrates the need for a continental approach to fight the threat of terrorism in Mali. But for the African Union (AU) to be effective in resolving the Malian impasse, its diplomatic, political, and military approaches have been discussed and critiqued. The article suggests the need to retool the security architecture of the AU - the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) - and particularly, to ensure the full operationalisation of the Common African Defence and Security Policy (CADSP) and the African Standby Force (ASF). Importantly, the AU must also have a counterterrorism fund dedicated to support the fight against terrorism in Mali and Africa as a whole.

Abstract: Of the variety of ways governments, organisations and artists are embedding art and culture within rural tourism strategy, public art trails have emerged as a popular form and approach. However, rural and remote local governments face challenges in realising possible benefits of arts tourism for their communities. This article takes remote northern Australia art tourism initiative, the Savannah Way Art Trail, as a case study to consider principles for successfully connecting public art trails with tourism in remote communities. Processes of delivering the Savannah Way Art Trail are framed and discussed under three themes: 1) local government capacity and relationships; 2) listening to locals; and 3) the 'art' of creating and managing remote art trails. These themes are considered as recommendations that can provide ways to enact cultural policy in practice in remote communities, and opportunities for extending the potential for art trails to reflect and benefit those communities.

Abstract: Purpose As custodians of takaful contributors' tabarru' (donation) funds, takaful operators are expected to fulfil a stewardship role propagated under the precepts of Islam. The purpose of this paper is to analyse takaful operators' stewardship, focusing on investment practices. Design/methodology/approach Structured interviews were conducted with senior investment staff from all of Malaysia's takaful operators. Questions, developed using Delphi-style techniques, allowed a five-point Likert scale response addressing specific issues revolving around seven dimensions of governance quality - using the Malaysian Rating Corporation's (MARC's) governance rating guidelines for Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). Interviewees' responses were assigned composite scores. Findings Malaysia's takaful operators score well on most prescribed governance quality dimensions, although performance varies between operators and across dimensions. Areas for improvement are identified, especially regarding disclosure of information and contributor involvement in takaful operators' management. Research limitations/implications - Predetermined questions restrict flexibility in obtaining takaful operators' information; however, end-of-interview, open-ended questions were asked to tap interviewee opinions on pertinent issues. A focus on takaful operators' governance quality and stewardship of investments means findings may not be representative of all operational aspects of their businesses. Practical implications - This study identifies governance quality guidelines which takaful operators may benchmark against and identifies where best to focus attempts to improve performance. These guidelines will also assist regulators assessing takaful operators' stewardship performance. Originality/value This study uses governance quality as an indicator of stewardship, a concept aligned with the precepts of Shariah. It covers the opinion of the takaful industry in a country with a comprehensive Islamic financial system, Malaysia, extending understanding of takaful operators' governance quality.

Abstract: In recent decades, the education of public administrators has been given renewed emphasis in public service reform. This poses an important question what should be in the curriculum? This is important because the content of the curriculum will help shape the public servants who have a significant influence on the quality of public service and public policy. This study attempts to explore the issue of curriculum design by reviewing and comparing the core curriculum of MPA programs in different countries. Using information from the website of 25 universities in 9 countries and applying content analysis, this study describes and compares the core components of the curriculum. Although there is much variation, two curriculum emphases emerge - programs that are skills-based and those that are knowledge-based. These emphases show some regionalism and present many challenges. It is necessary to think carefully about potential consequence of public administration education, and prudently choose to the content and the education:

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: How does globalization affect COVID-19 responses?

Abstract: Background The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vast differences in approaches to the control and containment of coronavirus across the world and has demonstrated the varied success of such approaches in minimizing the transmission of coronavirus. While previous studies have demonstrated high predictive power of incorporating air travel data and governmental policy responses in global disease transmission modelling, factors influencing the decision to implement travel and border restriction policies have attracted relatively less attention. This paper examines the role of globalization on the pace of adoption of international travel-related non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the coronavirus pandemic. This study aims to offer advice on how to improve the global planning, preparation, and coordination of actions and policy responses during future infectious disease outbreaks with empirical evidence. Methods and data We analyzed data on international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 of 185 countries from January to October 2020. We applied time-to-event analysis to examine the relationship between globalization and the timing of travel restrictions implementation. Results The results of our survival analysis suggest that, in general, more globalized countries, accounting for the country-specific timing of the virus outbreak and other factors, are more likely to adopt international travel restrictions policies. However, countries with high government effectiveness and globalization were more cautious in implementing travel restrictions, particularly if through formal political and trade policy integration. This finding is supported by a placebo analysis of domestic NPIs, where such a relationship is absent. Additionally, we find that globalized countries with high state capacity are more likely to have higher numbers of confirmed cases by the time a first restriction policy measure was taken. Conclusions The findings highlight the dynamic relationship between globalization and protectionism when governments respond to significant global events such as a public health crisis. We suggest that the observed caution of policy implementation by countries with high government efficiency and globalization is a by-product of commitment to existing trade agreements, a greater desire to 'learn from others' and also perhaps of 'confidence' in a government's ability to deal with a pandemic through its health system and state capacity. Our results suggest further research is warranted to explore whether global infectious disease forecasting could be improved by including the globalization index and in particular, the de jure economic and political, and de facto social dimensions of globalization, while accounting for the mediating role of government effectiveness. By acting as proxies for a countries' likelihood and speed of implementation for international travel restriction policies, such measures may predict the likely time delays in disease emergence and transmission across national borders.

Abstract: This article examines the Xi Jinping-era stability maintenance behemoth called "Safe China." Safe China is a regime of activities that integrates "public order" policing and surveillance with "social governance." It is linked to the Chinese Communist Party's "Overall National Security Outlook" and its main task is "political security." Our analysis of Safe China recognizes integration as its main animating principle. Three elements of Safe China-its ideological rationale, its on-the-ground public order and social governance mechanisms, and the party's absolute leadership over its operation at the grassroots-are conducive to this integration process. Ultimately, through Safe China, the party is seeking to modernize its own governance capacity and embed its leadership more fully into grassroots society, to ensure long-lasting "peace and safety," not only for the nation but for itself.

Abstract: Well-established research into different models of capitalism has not been applied well to developing countries. Changing global conditions, institutional differences, and path-dependent histories have forced late developing countries to create models of their own. By and large, however, these models have been less than successful in fostering economic development through technological upgrading. A comparison of skills upgrading in several fast-growing economies in Southeast Asia suggests that perhaps there is a new "State Coordinated, Liberal Market Economy" developmental model that can successfully lead to upgrading-driven economic development. This model combines elements from the Developmental State, Coordinated Market, and Liberal Market Economy models while differing significantly from each.

Abstract: Objective Small Island Developing States (SIDS) struggle with implementing multisectoral tobacco control measures, and health sector actors often lack capacity to forge multisectoral commitment. This study aims to explore the sources and dynamics of authority that can enable multisectoral collaboration despite the divergence of policy agendas in tobacco control. Methods We applied a qualitative, explorative case study design, with data collection and analysis guided by an analytical framework that identifies sources and dynamics of authority. Seventy interviews were conducted in Fiji and Vanuatu between 2018 and 2019. Results The key features shaping multisectoral coordination for tobacco control in Fiji and Vanuatu are the expert, institutional, capacity-based and legal authority that state and non-state actors have in tobacco governance. The amount of authority actors can secure from these sources was shown to be influenced by their performance (perceived or real), the discourse around tobacco control, the existing legal tools and their strategic alliances. SIDS vulnerabilities, arising from small size, isolation and developing economies, facilitate an economic growth discourse that reduces health sector actors' authority and empowers protobacco actors to drive tobacco governance. Conclusions Our results highlight the need for terms of engagement with the tobacco industry to enable governments to implement multisectoral tobacco control measures. Expanding assistance on tobacco control among government and civil society actors and increasing messaging about the impact of economic, trade and agricultural practices on health are essential to help SIDS implement the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

Abstract: This paper presents the local institutional and organizational development insights from a five-year ongoing interdisciplinary research project focused on advancing the implementation of sustainable urban water management. While it is broadly acknowledged that the inertia associated with administrative systems is possibly the most significant obstacle to advancing sustainable urban water management, contemporary research still largely prioritizes investigations at the technological level. This research is explicitly concerned with critically informing the design of methodologies for mobilizing and overcoming the administrative inertia of traditional urban water management practice. The results of fourteen in-depth case studies of local government organizations across Metropolitan Sydney primarily reveal that (i) the political institutionalization of environmental concern and (ii) the commitment to local leadership and organizational learning are key corporate attributes for enabling sustainable management. A typology of five organizational development phases has been proposed as both a heuristic and capacity benchmarking tool for urban water strategists, policy makers, and decision makers that are focused on improving the level of local implementation of sustainable urban water management activity. While this investigation has focused on local government, these findings do provide guideposts for assessing the development needs of future capacity building programs across a range of different institutional contexts.

Abstract: The integration of urban water cycle management with urban planning and design is referred to as 'Water Sensitive Urban Design' or 'WSUD' in Australia; one of the key elements of WSUD is the management of urban stormwater. In early 2006, the Victorian Government released the Yarra River Action Plan, which allocated $20 million towards tackling urban stormwater pollution. To help ensure this money is allocated in an equitable and transparent manner across all metropolitan local governments a multi-criteria assessment tool has been developed. This paper presents an overview of the multi-criteria assessment tool developed and adopted for selecting WSUD projects that are eligible for funding through Melbourne Water's Stormwater Program. This tool considers three types of indicators: environmental, engagement (engagement with stakeholders and local government capacity building) and financial. Within each category, a series of indicators of different weightings are applied to score a project. Where initial concept designs do not meet the Program criteria, additional work is undertaken to refine and improve the project. The tool and its use are illustrated with a case study.

Abstract: This article evaluates the Brown-effect 'real' and 'potential' on public services production in the UK. It is observed, rather unsurprisingly, that Gordon Brown's approach to public services reform is a logical extension of the New Labour modernisation project and represents the extension of new public management (NPM) methods articulated in the populist rhetoric of 'choice', 'personalisation' and 'user' engagement. It is argued, however, that while the adoption of NPM was an important phase in the modernisation of Britain's public services, it is simply unequal to the challenge of public service provision in an era of networked governance. This is because it privileges the role of technocrats, takes the politics out of public policy deliberation and its market orientation is at odds with the concept of public service. In consequence, the success of public service reform rests on the development of representative as well as technocratic networks which can meet the demands of both representative democracy and the efficient delivery of public goods. A set of recommendations are advanced for these purposes rooted in a 'maximalist' ('deep democratisation') conception of public value.

Abstract: One of the major global challenges that most affect the world economies are geopolitical risks triggered by tensions arising from exploiting natural resources. This paper attempts to study the influences of global governance indicators (voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, the rule of law, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and control of corruption) on natural resource rents in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Middle East & North Africa (MENA). We apply a new panel quantile estimation technique to panel data from 62 countries from 1996 to 2021. The results show, in general, in both MENA and SSA economies, there is a negative perception of the quality of governance. This is due to several factors, such as the absence of popular participation and transparency in decision-making, political instability, violence and terrorism, low government efficacy, low-quality regulation, lack of the rule of law, and high corruption in these regions. Thus, governance quality could be the driver of geopolitical risks in resource-rich economies. This study adds to the literature on geopolitical risk by assessing the impact of the perceived quality of governance on natural resource income in the MENA and SSA regions. Furthermore, it is the first study to compare two regions, with many countries, regarding the effects of global governance indicators on natural resource rents. In addition, it has been empirically demonstrated that the deterioration of the quality of government is associated with increased revenues from the exploitation of natural resources, which increases the likelihood of geopolitical tensions. Higher quality and more effective governance require less complex, more transparent, and less contradictory regulations, reducing the likelihood of geopolitical tensions. Practical and policy implications are drawn from the findings to help the MENA and SSA economies overcome geopolitical risks.

Abstract: Using firm-level data from 23 developed markets, we document a positive association between overall firm-level governance quality and the informativeness of earnings announcements measured by abnormal stock return variance. This finding is robust after controlling for the potential endogeneity of firm-level corporate governance. Further analyses reveal that firms with strong governance show little evidence of earnings management, appoint Big 4 auditing firms, and attract analyst following, implying a positive link between strong corporate governance and the information quality of earnings announcements. Finally, there is some evidence that the relation between firm-level governance and market reactions around the announcements exists only in countries characterized by a transparent information environment and strong legal investor protection.

Abstract: This paper provides a quantitative analysis of stakeholder perceptions regarding the governance of the UN climate change negotiations on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+). Governance quality and legitimacy were evaluated by means of an online survey conducted in 2011, using a normative framework of principles, criteria and indicators. The paper concentrates on national-level stakeholders active in REDD+ in Nepal, and their perceptions of governance quality, with a discussion, given the focus of this special volume, that emphasizes inclusiveness, equality and resources (indicators of interest representation) and democracy, agreement and dispute settlement (indicators of decision-making). Respondents were selected from state (i.e. governmental) and non-state (i.e. civil society) interests from a range of sectors active in REDD+ at the national level. The results show that survey respondents generally found REDD+ to be inclusive, but did not consider that there was the necessary capacity, or resources, for meaningful participation. A concluding section reviews the framework applied, and comments on the nature of multi-stakeholder relations in contemporary global governance, and REDD+ specifically.

Abstract: BackgroundIndigenous young people worldwide possess unique protective factors that support wellbeing. However, they experience mental illness at higher rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. Digital mental health (dMH) resources can increase access to structured, timely, and culturally tailored mental health interventions by reducing structural and attitudinal barriers to accessing treatment. The involvement of Indigenous young people in dMH resource development is recommended, however, no guidelines exist on how this can best be facilitated.MethodsA scoping review examining processes to involve Indigenous young people in developing or evaluating dMH interventions was conducted. Studies reported between 1990 and 2023 involving Indigenous young people aged 12-24 years, originating from Canada, the USA, New Zealand, and Australia, in the development or evaluation of dMH interventions were eligible for inclusion. Following a three-step search process, four electronic databases were searched. Data were extracted, synthesized, and described under three categories: dMH intervention attributes, study design, and alignment with research best practice. Best practice recommendations for Indigenous research and participatory design principles derived from the literature were identified and synthesised. Included studies were assessed against these recommendations. Consultation with two Senior Indigenous Research Officers ensured Indigenous worldviews informed analysis.ResultsTwenty-four studies describing eleven dMH interventions met inclusion criteria. Studies included formative, design, pilot, and efficacy studies. Overall, most included studies demonstrated a high degree of Indigenous governance, capacity building, and community benefit. All studies adapted their research processes to ensure that local community protocols were followed and most aligned these within an Indigenous research paradigm. Formal agreements regarding existing and created intellectual property and implementation evaluations were rare. Outcomes were the primary focus of reporting, with limited detailed descriptions of governance and decision-making processes or strategies for managing predictable tensions between co-design stakeholders.ConclusionsThis study identified recommendations for undertaking participatory design with Indigenous young people and evaluated the current literature against these criteria. Common gaps were evident in the reporting of study processes. Consistent, in-depth reporting is needed to allow assessment of approaches for this hard-to-reach population. An emergent framework, informed by our findings, for guiding the involvement of Indigenous young people in the design and evaluation of dMH tools is presented.

Abstract: Social mobilization has long been considered a major characteristic of Chinese life and, more recently, a key aspect of China's state capacity. The existing literature on social mobilization in the country, however, is characterized by studies of pre-1978 China, many of which are scattered and fragmentary. This problem has not only resulted in misjudging the vital role of social mobilization as a process of change and an analytical construct, but has also overlooked the work of other researchers, especially those in China, studying a wide range of aspects of socio-economic and socio-political activities in present-day China. As a result, the research literature has not kept pace with the profound changes occurring in the country, providing no adequate theoretical foundation and capability for analyzing and theorizing the dynamics at work in contemporary China. This analytical article seeks to critically review the current state of knowledge relating to social mobilization in China and the main theoretical problems in the literature, paying special attention to the missing links between different perspectives. Resume Depuis longtemps, la mobilisation sociale est consideree comme l'une des principales caracteristiques de la vie chinoise et plus recemment, comme l'une des principales capacites de l'Etat chinois.

Abstract: We examine the impact of options trading on audit pricing for a sample of US firms over the period from 2004 to 2021. We find that options trading is significantly and negatively related to audit fees, indicating that firms characterized by higher options trading incur lower audit fees. Auditors spend a lower number of days auditing firms with higher options trading and firms with higher options trading experience lower probabilities of lawsuits, and misstatements, and lower likelihood of material weaknesses and auditor opinion on internal controls. The impact of options trading on audit fees is stronger when the auditor is located further away from the audited firm, for firms with non-specialized auditors, higher information asymmetry problems, poorer earnings and lower governance quality. Overall, our findings underscore the significance of options trading in improving a firm's information environment and reducing litigation risk, resulting in lower audit fees.

Abstract: Small island developing states (SIDS) are among the most vulnerable in the world to the impacts of climate change. SIDS have prioritised adaptation to climate change as it is widely accepted that some climate change is inevitable. Given the high cost of adaptation and the financial constraints faced by SIDS, many have pursued international adaptation financing to meet adaptation costs and ease domestic constraints. This paper analyses international adaptation financing commitments to SIDS across multiple regions between 2010 and 2014. It has three aims. First, it identifies trends in this financing from Members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to SIDS. Second, using a multivariate regression model, it identifies the determinants of this financing to SIDS, compared to other developing countries. Third, it elicits the perspectives of policy-makers in SIDS on their experience with international adaptation financing to date. This study finds that (1) the allocation of funding and donor commitments to SIDS is highly skewed, (2) whether a country is classified as a SIDS is a determinant of the amount of adaptation financing it can expect to receive-other determinants include population, per capita income, governance quality and vulnerability, depending on how it is conceptualised and measured, and (3) SIDS are dissatisfied with the current levels of international adaptation financing and their experience with accessing it. This paper concludes that, while international adaptation flows have not been sufficient, SIDS have not been disadvantaged in their access to such financing over the period, compared to other developing countries.

Abstract: As literature on the 'shadow state' shows, the voluntary sector has long served as a necessary conduit through which states orchestrate the governance of various populations. However, relatively little is known about the active role that voluntary organisations play in shaping and mobilising the capacities of the state to advance their own projects and interests. We draw out aspects of post-structural theories of the state, and particularly assemblage thinking, that provide the conceptual and analytical tools with which to explore how voluntary organisations may exceed their common positioning as co-opted by, and subservient to, the state. Through empirical research on homelessness policy development in Australia, we show how locally embedded voluntary organisations in Australia and the United States acted strategically and engaged transnationally - through material practices and multi-sited labours - to create opportunities to shape formal state agenda at national and sub-national levels. The activities and influence of these voluntary organisations are illustrative of the assembled nature of state capacity.

Abstract: Information on deaths by age, sex, and cause are primary inputs for health policy and epidemiological research. Currently, most developing countries lack efficient death registration systems that generate these data on a routine and timely basis. The global community is promoting initiatives to establish and strengthen national mortality statistics programs across the developing world. Building human, technical, and institutional capacity to operate these programs are essential elements for the program. In Indonesia, the government has established a national Sample Registration System (SRS) covering a population of 9 million and is looking toward further scaling up of operations of the mortality statistics program in conjunction with expansion of the national Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems. This article reports the theoretical and practical perspectives gained from experiences in developing human capacity in the Indonesian context. These perspectives are described in terms of the institutional, personnel, and functional components of the program for collection, compilation, analysis, and utilisation of mortality and cause of death data. The article also describes the challenges and potential solutions for implementing capacity building activities at national and subnational level. In conclusion, the need for and availability of training resources are discussed, including the potential for involvement of public health academia and international collaborations within a research framework on program management, quality evaluation, and data utilisation. Adequate attention to capacity building is essential to ensure the success and sustainability of national mortality statistics programs. (C) 2019 Atlantis Press International B.V.

Abstract: This study examines the role of governance in transitioning from middle-to high-income status in 20 countries. All the growth models indicate that the rule of law plays a significant role. Significant interactions among government effectiveness were observed in the post-transition period. A significant effect of political stability and corruption control and a significant interaction effect of government effectiveness were also observed in the transition to high income, using extended Cox regression. The probit regression revealed that the interaction of low government effectiveness, low insurance, heavy reliance on agriculture, high fertility rates, high inflation, limited foreign investment and excessive public debt posed obstacles to achieving high-income status. The weak rule of law, corruption control and regulatory quality also affected the failure of the 42 upper-middle-income countries to reach a high-income level.

Abstract: Information on cause-specific mortality from civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems is essential for health policy and epidemiological research. Currently, there are critical gaps in the international availability of timely and reliable mortality data, which limits planned progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This article describes an evidence-based strategic approach for strengthening mortality data from CRVS systems. National mortality data availability scores from the Global Burden of Disease study were used to group countries into those with adequate, partial or negligible mortality data. These were further categorised by geographical region and population size, which showed that there were shortcomings in availability of mortality data in approximately two-thirds of all countries. Existing frameworks for evaluating design and functional status of mortality components of CRVS systems were reviewed to identify themes and topics for assessment. Detailed national programme assessments can be used to investigate systemic issues that are likely to affect death reporting, cause of death ascertainment and data management. Assessment findings can guide interventions to strengthen system performance. The strategic national approach should be customised according to data availability and population size and supported by human and institutional capacity building. Countries with larger populations should use an incremental sampling approach to strengthen CRVS systems and use interim data for mortality estimation. Periodic data quality evaluation is required to monitor system performance and scale up interventions. A comprehensive implementation and operations research programme should be concurrently launched to evaluate the feasibility, success and sustainability of system strengthening activities.

Abstract: Background: Telephone triage and advice services (TTAS) are increasingly being implemented around the world. These services allow people to speak to a nurse or general practitioner over the telephone and receive assessment and healthcare advice. There is an existing body of research on the topic of TTAS, however the diffuseness of the evidence base makes it difficult to identify key lessons that are consistent across the literature. Systematic reviews represent the highest level of evidence synthesis. We aimed to undertake an overview of such reviews to determine the scope, consistency and generalisability of findings in relation to the governance, safety and quality of TTAS. Methods: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for English language systematic reviews focused on key governance, quality and safety findings related to telephone based triage and advice services, published since 1990. The search was undertaken by three researchers who reached consensus on all included systematic reviews. An appraisal of the methodological quality of the systematic reviews was independently undertaken by two researchers using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. Results: Ten systematic reviews from a potential 291 results were selected for inclusion. TTAS was examined either alone, or as part of a primary care service model or intervention designed to improve primary care. Evidence of TTAS performance was reported across nine key indicators - access, appropriateness, compliance, patient satisfaction, cost, safety, health service utilisation, physician workload and clinical outcomes. Patient satisfaction with TTAS was generally high and there is some consistency of evidence of the ability of TTAS to reduce clinical workload. Measures of the safety of TTAS tended to show that there is no major difference between TTAS and traditional care. Conclusions: Taken as a whole, current evidence does not provide definitive answers to questions about the quality of care provided, access and equity of the service, its costs and outcomes. The available evidence also suggests that there are many interactional factors (e.g., relationship with other health service providers) which can impact on measures of performance, and also affect the external validity of the research findings.

Abstract: This paper investigates non-financial reporting in non-profit organisations. Specifically, it examines the extent to which UK higher education institutions (HEIs) make voluntary disclosures relating to risk management practices, and investigates whether composite governance quality index and senior management team characteristics can influence such risk disclosures. Using a sample of UK HEIs over a number of years and drawing insights from neo-institutional theory, our findings are three-fold. First, our baseline findings contribute to the literature by showing that the level of risk disclosure among HEIs in the UK is relatively low, especially when compared to the findings of prior studies that have been conducted on similar-sized publicly traded corporations. Second, we contribute to the literature by providing timely evidence on the impact of governance quality on risk disclosure. In particular, our evidence contributes to the existing literature by demonstrating that better-governed HEIs tend to engage in higher risk disclosures than their poorly-governed counterparts. Finally, our study contributes to the extant literature by providing new evidence that offers support for the "shared" governance model among UK HEIs. Specifically, our findings show that the positive governance quality-risk disclosure relationship is moderated/explained largely by the characteristics of the senior management team. Our findings are robust to controlling for endogeneities and alternative estimation techniques, with major implications for non-financial reporting.

Abstract: Pakistan's power sector has undergone significant reforms since 1994 to improve technical and financial performance. This study aims to measure the post-reform efficiency dynamics of electricity distribution utilities from 2015 to 2019 by taking Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) as a case study. The study also assesses the role of consumers' self-confidence in a particular business environment to participate as investors in the electric utility sector. The total factor productivity index and PLS-SEM approach were applied to validate the framework empirically. Results from the former show negative growth, as all index components remained negative except for efficiency change. It has been concluded that the standard of governance improves the business environment of the utility sector, which does not adequately describe the industrial performance of Pakistan's utility sector. Moreover, consumer self-confidence (e.g., information acquisition confidence and social outcome confidence) significantly mediates between the business environment and industrial output. Thus, consumer self-confidence is a prerequisite to maximizing industrial growth in the utility sector. Practitioners should launch a policy framework to enhance consumer self-confidence in the local context and, as a result, enhance the electric utility sector's industrial growth.

Abstract: Food systems and the communities they support are increasingly challenged by climate change and the need to arrest escalating threats through mitigation and adaptation. To ensure climate change mitigation strategies can be implemented effectively and to support substantial gains in greenhouse gas emissions reduction, it is, therefore, valuable to understand where climate-smart strategies might be used for best effect. We assessed mariculture in 171 coastal countries for vulnerabilities to climate change (12 indicators) and opportunities to deliver climate mitigation outcomes (nine indicators). We identified Northern America and Europe as having comparatively lower regional vulnerability and higher opportunity for impact on climate mitigation. Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway and the United States of America were identified as well-positioned to advance strategies linked to mariculture. However, the nature of vulnerabilities and opportunities within and between all regions and countries varied, due to the formation of existing mariculture, human development factors and governance capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that global discussion will be valuable to motivating climate-smart approaches associated with mariculture, but to ensure these solutions contribute to a resilient future, for industry, ecosystems and communities, local adaptation will be needed to address constraints and to leverage local prospects.This article is part of the theme issue 'Nurturing resilient marine ecosystems'.

Abstract: A well-functioning revenue system is a necessary condition for strong, sustained and inclusive economic development. However, the revenue systems in some developing countries have fundamental shortcomings. Using Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment data, this article provides a summary of the revenue raising capabilities across 58 developing countries. Tax reforms or tax system changes need to be made mindful of that current capacity. The optimal choice of tax regime may be different when administrative capacity is low. The increasing globalisation of economic activity adds a further layer of complexity that developing countries need to manage in building and maintaining their revenue systems. Finally, any proposals to change the revenue system in a developing country need to recognise that, like developed countries, tax reforms are highly political endeavours.

Abstract: This paper causally links petroleum dependence to political instability in developing countries through the three core characteristics of the rentier state?weak institutional capacity, a distributive political economy, and elite capture and predation. Traditional rentier state theory, centered primarily on the experiences of authoritarian, middle-income countries, holds that oil-rich regimes use their rents to secure political stability. By contrast, this paper argues that rentier practices can fuel rather than inhibit civil unrest in institutionally weaker developing countries. The causal pathway is demonstrated with field research-based process tracing of the case of TimorLeste. There, the apparently benevolent distribution of petroleum rents has secured some dimensions of peace but has also activated new vectors of political instability. Moreover, the predatory capture by political?economic elites of an expanding rent share provokes societal grievance and potential instability on another front. Weak institutional capacity makes the state less able to deal with these elements of domestic unrest. A major implication of this research is that even where the other factors known to interact with oil wealth in fueling conflict are scarce, petroleum dependence itself could contribute to political instability as a result of the rentier effects it puts in motion.

Abstract: Improving the energy efficiency of economies is the core of promoting global sustainable development. At present, improving energy efficiency is a common problem faced by all countries. In this paper, the Three-stage DEA model improved by radial slack based measure (SBM) model is used to evaluate the energy efficiency and influencing factors of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) members. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes of energy efficiency of each country are further explored by the Malmquist index model. The empirical analysis shows that the energy efficiency of China, Japan, and Australia are all 1, which is at the forefront of efficiency, while the energy efficiency of Vietnam is the lowest, which is 0.136. China's technological progress change index is 1.013, leading other countries. The results of the study are helpful to understand the trend of energy efficiency changes in various countries, to transform their energy efficiency advantages into the common advantages of each member state, and to improve the comprehensive governance capacity of energy efficiency of each country.

Abstract: Private nature reserves created by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are increasing, and their growing number and extent means that they can potentially contribute to biodiversity goals at a global scale. However, the success of these reserves depends on the legal, economic and institutional conditions framing their creation and management. We explored these conditions, and the opportunities and challenges facing conservation organizations in managing private nature reserves, across several countries, with an emphasis on Australia. Results from 17 semi-structured interviews with representatives of private conservation organizations indicated that while private reserves may enhance the conservation estate, challenges remain. Legal frameworks, especially tenure and economic laws, vary across and within countries, presenting conservation organizations with significant opportunities or constraints to owning and/or managing private nature reserves. Many acquired land without strategic acquisition procedures and secured funding for property acquisition but not management, affecting the long-term maintenance of properties. Other typical problems were tied to the institutional capacity of the organizations. Greater planning within organizations, especially financial planning, is required and NGOs must understand opportunities and constraints present in legislative frameworks at the outset. Organizations must establish their expertise gaps and address them. To this end, partnerships between organizations and/or with government can prove critical.

Abstract: Natural resource governance regimes are increasingly engaging various actors at multiple levels to address sustainability challenges. In this context, as a governance strategy, decentralisation - or the transfer of power from central to local authorities - is expected to improve service delivery, accountability, and participation. The paper examines whether decentralisation in wildlife refuge politics in Taiwan delivers these outcomes; what factors influence local governments' capacities and powers to manage Chiku wildlife refuge in Taiwan; and what accountability mechanisms decentralisation policies enable. Multiple levels of governance are resistant to decentralisation, due to lack of ability and resources, evolving incentive structures, and conflicting regulations in a fragmented jurisdictional context. According to the findings, local authorities are becoming less engaged, agencies involved lack coordination, and accountability mechanisms are inadequate. The potential benefits of decentralisation are therefore hard to achieve.

Abstract: Both government and international donor agencies now promote the use of tourism to alleviate poverty. The Botswana government has embraced tourism as a meaningful and sustainable economic activity and diversification opportunity, which now ranks second after mining in its contribution to the country's gross domestic product. The study reported in this paper investigates perceptions of stakeholders on the opportunities that would be created for the poor by opening up Botswana's forest reserves for ecotourism. Data was collected through mixed methods involving in-depth interviews with government departments, traditional leaders, quasi-government organisations and the Hospitality and Tourism Association of Botswana. Focus group discussions were also held with village development committees, Chobe Enclave Conservation Trust (CECT) and Kasane, Lesoma and Pandematenga Trust (KALEPA) members, and a consultative national workshop of stakeholders was also held. The findings indicate that opening up forest reserves for ecotourism has the potential to alleviate poverty among the disadvantaged groups living adjacent to forest reserves through direct (employment, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)), secondary (linkages/partnerships) and dynamic effects (sustainable livelihoods). The study concludes by cautioning that whilst pro-poor tourism may yield short- and medium-term benefits, in keeping with sustainability objectives, participants in the programme need to be mindful of forestry encroachment and come up with strategies to ensure the sustainability of the Botswana forest reserves.

Abstract: Understanding popular attitudes to climate change can be important in developing effective climate adaptation responses. However, in the Pacific region, which is at the forefront of impacts of a changing climate, little attention has been given to popular perceptions of climate change. This paper presents the findings of a climate change module in the first Pacific Attitudes Survey (PAS), conducted in Samoa from December 2020 to January 2021. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of Samoans of voting age (n = 1319), the PAS gauges the views of ordinary Samoans towards climate change, including perceptions of the urgency of climate change action, perceptions of the effects of climate change in Samoa, and of individual or institutional capacity to act on climate change. Findings reveal that while most respondents believe that climate change was an urgent problem that needs to be addressed, a significant minority thought it will "never be necessary" to address climate change. This study also found level of education to be a significant factor in climate beliefs. Respondents who had higher education levels were more likely to rate climate change as an urgent problem. Those identifying climate change as an urgent problem that needs to be addressed were significantly more likely to agree that climate change was affecting Samoa in general and their own personal lives. We also found a significant association between perceptions that climate change was an "urgent problem that needs to be addressed", and willingness to permanently migrate for work.

Abstract: In this paper I analyze investors' reactions to changes in the expense ratios of equity mutual funds. I show that investment flows' response to fees cannot be fully explained by looking at investors' performance sensitivity. While performance sensitivity monotonically increases with past performance, price sensitivity does not: investors who buy top past performers seem to be "distracted" by the fund's previous return and pay relatively little attention to the expense ratios. Moreover price sensitivity increases with fund visibility while performance sensitivity decreases, and while looking at data from 1986 to 2006 no discernible trend can be observed in the average performance sensitivity, price sensitivity strongly increases due to the dramatic increase in the availability of mutual funds' information for retail investors. Finally I show that investment companies strategically time their repricing decisions in order to exploit time variations in price and performance sensitivities, and that fund governance quality affects the degree to which investment companies engage in this opportunistic behavior.

Abstract: In the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) in 1997, some observers pronounced the demise of the developmental state. This view has recently been challenged by scholars who argue that rather than the demise of the developmental state, the role of the state has been reconfigured in the post-AFC period to meet new economic challenges and social demands. The provision of more inclusive social protection by the state is now a significant consideration. This paper will examine the role of the state in social protection in India with reference to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) which was introduced through an Act of Parliament in 2005. There are two distinguishing features of MGNREGS: it guarantees employment as a legal right, and through the provision for mandatory social audits by the beneficiaries of the scheme, it promises accountability from below. However, it is arguable whether the state has demonstrated a capacity to deliver effectively on its rights-based programme This chapter raises the central question: What does the implementation of MGNREGS reveal about the capacity of the state to provide social protection and accountability in contemporary India? The discussion cautions against viewing the state as a homogenous entity.

Abstract: This study investigates how research data contributes to non-academic impacts using a secondary analysis of high-scoring impact case studies from the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF). A content analysis was conducted to identify patterns, linking research data and impact. The most prevalent type of research data-driven impact related to "practice" (45%), which included changing how professionals operate, changing organizational culture and improving workplace productivity or outcomes. The second most common category was "government impacts", including reducing government service costs and enhancing government effectiveness or efficiency. Impacts from research data were developed most frequently through "improved institutional processes or methods" (40%) and developing impact via pre-analyzed or curated information in reports (32%), followed by "analytic software or methods" (26%). The analysis found that research data on their own rarely generate impacts. Instead they require analysis, curation, product development or other forms of significant intervention to leverage broader non-academic impacts.

Abstract: Within European Cohesion Policy, some regions manifest chronic problems with absorbing structural funds, probably due to inadequate administrative capacity. Despite the continuous assistance to improve capacity and the accumulation of learning and experience, poor performances still persist in some territories, rendering the initial explanation partial. By collecting (reports' analysis and field research), consolidating (grounded theory), and mapping (system dynamics) two Italian regions with contrasting absorption performance, this study investigates how regional authorities may be trapped in systemic decision-making structures that prioritize short-term outcomes perpetuating low absorption rates. Within a multilevel-governance context, we suggest that these decision-making traps stem from the discrepancy between European and local policy-makers' mental models; although European policies aim to promote timely absorption, sometimes they fail to acknowledge local authorities' actual agenda and may unintentionally prompt regions to overemphasize short term funds' expenditure instead of improving administrative capacity in the long term.

Abstract: This paper critically examines the inadequacies of sentencing practice in relation to a number of aspects of offender psychology. It Is argued that sentencers are inadequately informed in regard to the two major goals of sentencing: deterrence and rehabilitation. Without conducting thorough evaluations of the effectiveness of sentencing, including an analysis of the experience of offenders, it is likely that ''sentencing in the dark'' will continue. The literature on the perspectives and beliefs of offenders suggests that although offenders may plead guilty in the hope of achieving a lower sentence, in many cases there is likely to be a lack of genuine remorse and therefore the sentencing process will not effectively engage the offender. Similarly, the literature on deterrence suggests that offenders underestimate their chances of getting caught, and this is likely to diminish the intended deterrent effect of sentencing. It is argued that the current arrangement suits both sentencers and offenders as bureaucratic efficiency is served and sentences are ''discounted''. It is suggested that psychology has much to offer the criminal justice system by critically evaluating the likely impact of various sentencing strategies and pointing out conflicts in sentencing practice. The first step, it is argued, should be an attempt to disentangle the confusion of sentencing and treatment that often places both offenders and treatment staff in conflict and compromises the integrity of treatment programs.

Abstract: Using the hand-collected data of 800 Vietnamese non-financial firms from 2008 to 2018, this study constructs a comprehensive corporate governance index in alignment with the corporate governance code of best practices in Vietnam. We provide strong evidence that corporate governance quality restrains earnings management, measured by both the absolute and signed discretionary accruals and the real earnings management. In particular, the negative association between corporate governance quality and earnings management is more profound in private firms (non-SOEs), firms with high foreign ownership and low concentrated ownership, and high growth firms compared to their peers. The observed results are robust to alternative measures of discretionary accruals, total accruals andreal earnings management. Furthermore, the results are corroborated using instrumental variables, firm fixed effects and propensity score matching methods to address potential reverse causality and sample selection bias.

Abstract: Market-based instruments (MBIs) are promoted as economically efficient, targeted solutions to otherwise intractable environmental policy problems with additional potential to improve the livelihood security of ecosystem service providers. This paper argues that the effectiveness of MBIs (and the likelihood therefore of sustained environmental and social outcomes) depends on a number of often unacknowledged assumptions about the distribution of benefits arising from ecosystem service provision, the rights and duties associated with resource access, and the fitness for purpose of various policy instruments. These assumptions are illustrated and discussed using The Benefit Flows and Property Rights Matrix. It is argued that the legitimacy of MBIs depends both on the demonstrability of distinct public benefit and of acceptance among the wider community that private resource users ought to be compensated in some way for the provision of that benefit. Effective provision of ecosystem services through a market-mechanism thereafter depends on a range of additional conditions including inter-changeability of supply, scalability, lack of corroboration, adequate information, financial capacity, clarity of property rights, clarity of resource access-related duties and institutional capacity. Meeting these conditions is not simply a matter of appropriate incentive design but of political decision-making, moral judgement and social learning. Failure to recognise these conditions potentially undermines the effectiveness not only of MBIs but of alternative policy measures taken contemporaneously with MBIs such as community-based natural resource management.

Abstract: Background Two international Conventions from the International Labor Organization (ILO; C162 Asbestos Convention) and the UN (Basel Convention) offer governments guidelines for achieving a total asbestos ban policy, but the long-term effect of these Conventions on policy implementation, and the role of government effectiveness, remains unknown. We aimed to investigate associations between government ratification of the ILO and UN international Conventions, government effectiveness, and implementation of a national total asbestos ban. Methods We obtained data for year of a national asbestos ban, year of ratification of one or both international Conventions, and World Bank government effectiveness scores for 108 countries that ever used asbestos. We did a survival analysis for countries with data in the follow-up period (March 22, 1989, to Feb 2, 2018) to assess whether ratification of the international Conventions and greater government effectiveness were associated with time of implementation of a national total asbestos ban. Findings Of 108 countries with data for asbestos consumption, nine were excluded because they implemented an asbestos ban before 1989. Therefore, 99 countries were included in the survival analysis. 26 countries ratified both international Conventions and 73 ratified either one or no Convention. Countries that ratified both Conventions had a shorter time to adoption of a total asbestos ban (mean 8.9 [SD 6.4] years) than did countries that ratified one or no Conventions (16.9 [6.1] years). After controlling for government effectiveness, countries that ratified both Conventions had a significantly higher conditional probability of banning asbestos than did those ratifying one or no Convention (hazard ratio [HR] 41.8, 95% CI 4.5-383.3; p=0.0010). For every 1 point increment in government effectiveness, the percentage change in HR for persistent asbestos consumption significantly increased by 127% (95% CI 13-354; p=0.021). Interpretation This study confirms that adoption of both the C162 Asbestos Convention and the Basel Convention facilitates countries in moving towards a total asbestos ban. The effect was reinforced by government effectiveness. Both international programmes and new agreements towards total asbestos bans and government commitments are needed.

Abstract: A fragmented and segmented social protection system can create barriers for labour migration and be socially divisive. A review of the literature on Europe's integration of its social insurance system demonstrates the preconditions for developing an integrated social insurance system. These include political determination, social agreement by the contributors, administrative capacity and financial management ability. In this article, the author explains that there has been an ongoing process of gradual unification of the social insurance system in China. However, this ongoing process has not been able to achieve a universal system for both the rural and urban populations. A recent push towards further unification has been problematic. Not only have difficulties arisen from an unwillingness to implement policies, as often discussed by critics; they are also embedded in a more profound fragmentation of ideas and interests, and in institutional constraints. The author argues that a new, non-contributory basic pension, together with lowered transaction costs between contributory subsystems, may be a more realistic way forwards.

Abstract: Given the increasing importance of constitutional modification in Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Africa, Europe, and Australia, it is imperative to study systemically the conditions under which formal constitutional amendments are likely to fail. In this paper, the authors isolate conditions whereby the instrumental objectives of participants in the politics of constitutional modification threaten to overload the institutional capacity of the amending process. The proximate cause of amendment process overload is indeterminacy regarding the redistributive impact of the proposed change. Redistributive indeterminacy is a function of a rigid amending process, an institutional structure that encourages a large number of constitutional players and amendments which provide broad scope for judicial interpretation. The authors isolate two critical factors: the intensity of mass and elite preferences surrounding constitutional proposals and the structure of the amending process itself. They next trace these factors back to institutional variables to create a model to explain and predict constitutional failure in a range of contexts. Finally, they apply the model to highly visible recent constitutional failures in the United States and Canada.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The stabilizing state: State capitalism as a response to financial globalization in one-party regimes

Abstract: One of the most important developments in the modern global economy is financial globalization. This has raised threats to the stability of political regimes in two ways: (1) by enhancing the possibility of a financial crisis that could cause political turmoil; and (2) by easing access to foreign sources of financing for opposition political groups. I argue that state capitalism - defined as state-owned publicly listed corporations - is greater among one-party regimes as a way to address these dual threats. One-party regimes have both the motivation and a greater institutional capacity for addressing these threats in comparison to other regimes. Tests are conducted on 607 firms in 1996 and 856 firms in 2008 across seven East Asian economies, and are supplemented with case studies of Malaysia and South Korea. The evidence suggests that financial globalization is contributing to the rise of the state as a counter reaction.

Abstract: The legal framework for mine closure and rehabilitation of new and former mine sites in South Africa, including legacy abandoned sites, is comprehensive. This paper discusses legislative provisions for mine site rehabilitation and closure in South Africa with reference to established international expectations. Overall, while the South African legislative framework for mine closure and rehabilitation generally conforms with international expectations for best practice, the system is extremely complex and unwieldy. Many individual laws, regulations, and guidelines and their corresponding ministries applicable to mine closure planning and management in South Africa has created a complicated interconnected raft of provisions and expectations. It is an open question whether the most recent amendments (December 2014), have untangled or rather added to the complexities. This historical complexity along with identified governance capacity constraints (financial, technical and experience based) likely explains why implementation of the legislative framework has fallen short of mine closure expectations and mandates. As South Africa is a jurisdiction on the African continent with much experience in mining, there are many lessons that are applicable to emerging countries in the region who wish to attract the benefits of the extractives industries and minimize their potential negative consequences.

Abstract: Evaluating agency theory and optimal contracting theory views of corporate philanthropy, we find that as corporate giving increases, shareholders reduce their valuation of firm cash holdings. Dividend increases following the 2003 Tax Reform Act are associated with reduced corporate giving. Using a natural experiment, we find that corporate giving is positively (negatively) associated with CEO charity preferences (CEO shareholdings and corporate governance quality). Evidence from CEO-affiliated charity donations, market reactions to insider-affiliated donations, its relation to CEO compensation, and firm contributions to director-affiliated charities indicates that corporate donations advance CEO interests and suggests misuses of corporate resources that reduce firm value.

Abstract: Regions of high biodiversity often coincide with regions of poverty and conservation can imply economic and social costs for poor resident populations. Environmental compensation is considered a tool to reduce socio-environmental conflict, improve the equity of conservation and promote sustainable development. The intricacies of specific socio-ecological systems may determine how compensation payments are interpreted locally to produce outcomes. This research examines the social perceptions of an ecological fiscal transfer which intends to compensate the local public administration for the substantial costs of conservation in a hotspot of biological and social diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. In this context we explore whether financial compensation (1) influences local perceptions of the conservation regime, (2) contributes towards the reconciliation of human-conservation conflicts and (3) triggers any meaningful socio-economic improvement that would counter the local costs of conservation. Results show that environmental compensation is not widely recognised as effectively benefiting the community. Local authorities consider compensation insufficient to enact a sustainable development agenda. Environmental compensation could play an important role in a policy mix for socially equitable conservation by being explicitly linked to community benefits, especially to fostering local livelihoods. The collaboration of actors operating across multiple governance levels may improve the institutional capacity of local actors to produce effective outcomes.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: A Perturbed Peace: Applying Complexity Theory to UN Peacekeeping

Abstract: This article explores the application of complexity theory to UN peacekeeping. To date, peacekeeping has been dominated by linear models of change, assuming that conflict settings can be addressed by elite-driven peace processes, gradual improvements to state institutional capacity, and development programming. However, this article argues that complexity theory offers a far more accurate and useful lens through which to view the work of peacekeeping: conflict settings represent complex, interdependent socio-political systems with emergent qualities giving them the capacity to self-organize via feedback loops and other adaptive activity. Self-organization means such systems are highly resistant to attempts to change behaviour via top-down or input-output approaches. In fact, peacekeeping itself is endogenous to the systems it is trying to change, often displaying the same kinds of self-organization typical of complex systems elsewhere. Drawing on experience working and conducting fieldwork in the UN peacekeping mission in Democratic Republic of the Congo, this article argues that UN peacekeeping operations should view themselves as actors within the complex conflict ecosystem, looking to enable transformational change from within, rather than impose liberal Western models from without.

Abstract: This study offers new insights into the largest threats to natural and mixed World Heritage sites in developed countries as considered by their management. In addition to this, the capacity of the management to deal with threats is examined. An Ordered Probit model is used that distinguishes three groups of threats and four categories of adaptive capacity of the management. Data originate from the 2014 UNESCO Periodic Report II for sites in economically advanced countries (Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea) linked to the World Heritage Site database. Estimation results reveal that the probability of a major threat to World Heritage sites is perceived to be highest in the category of climate change and extreme weather events, followed by local conditions affecting the physical structure (temperature, rain, dust). Sites in tropical climates are perceived as significantly more threatened, as are those earlier listed as in danger. The likelihood of perceiving a major threat is highest in Turkey, Italy, Norway and North America. Threats related to climate change are those the management has the lowest capacity to deal with when other important aspects are controlled for. Large and natural areas have a higher perceived administrative capacity to deal with threats than others.

Abstract: This paper explores the changing nature of North/South relations in contemporary climate change governance. Focusing on the United Nations Collaborative Programme to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the paper presents a theoretical framework, through which stakeholder perceptions of REDD+ governance quality and institutional legitimacy can be evaluated. This is tested by means of a small-n survey of state and non-state participants from both the developed and developing countries, including the Asia-Pacific region. The survey results reveal generally higher ratings for REDD+ amongst Southern participants than in the North. A number of caveats are placed on the interpretation of data, and some conclusions drawn regarding contemporary climate governance and the emergence of a possible 'South/North Divide', challenging traditional notions of global power politics.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of key elements contributing towards current and future prospects for governance in two MPAs in the Pacific Region of Guatemala. The paper follows the Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) empirical framework through the use of economic, interpretative, knowledge, legal and participative incentives that assess the effectiveness of governance. The first MPA is the Multiple Use Area of Monterrico that is governed through a co-management approach by the Centre of Conservation Studies of the University of San Carlos de Guatemala (CECON-USAC), whilst the second is Guatemala's only privately-owned marine protected area, La Chorrera-Manchon Guamuchal Reserve. The results highlight that the differences in the way they are governed have significantly shaped the effectiveness of governance. In the case of Monterrico, the limited state capacity and cross-jurisdictional coordination among stakeholders has resulted in weak economic and legal incentives, where efforts have failed to develop the necessary participatory approach to management. As a result, environmental degradation and increasing urban development is apparent, which have proven difficult to manage by the park management authority. Conversely, La Chorrera-Manch on Guamuchal has developed a governance approach based on local community involvement, which has proven successful for conservation and management initiatives for the reserve. Management is characterized by strong leadership, which has proven to be the underlying difference in both MPAs. However, the fate of the reserve is uncertain, as there is no long-term planning for success. Future prospects for effective governance are recommended, where efforts should primarily foster state involvement and political will.

Abstract: This article explores the child protection actors, processes and child maltreatment issues in a regional Local Government Unit in the Philippines. Utilising a qualitative case study design, it engages with 14 young people with histories of child maltreatment and 13 key child protection actors, exploring their views and experiences of child protection actions, processes and outcomes. The findings highlight informal community-based actors, including neighbours, family, friends and non-government organisations in initial responses to child maltreatment, compared to formal child protection actors, who respond to severe maltreatment utilising a legal framework. Actors are constrained by limited government capacity and community reach, revealing misalignment between formal child protection activities and breadth of risks for children. Non-government organisations assist child protection efforts through the provision of residential care. Policy recommendations include strengthening relationships between formal actors and communities, expanding early intervention activities, and developing the capacity of community-based child protection actors.

Abstract: BackgroundOne Health approach advocates realizing the best health and harmonious symbiosis of human, animal and natural environment through cross-border, multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation. The good governance model is the leading factor for the performance of One Health governance. In order to tackle the complex problems in the One Health governance at the global level, the variation of One Health governance in different countries was analyzed by a set of indicators within the One Health system.MethodThe capacity of One Health governance was assessed after establishment of a set of indicators for the One Health governance index (OHGI) following the methodology of the global One Health index. The data to calculate OHGI was collected from various database sources, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and official health-related institutions of various countries. Eight indicators (including 19 sub-indicators) were employed in the OHGI system to comprehensively evaluate the capacity of One Health governance in 146 countries of the world.ResultsAmong the 146 countries scored in the OHGI system, the average score was 34.11, with a median score of 31.49, ranged from 8.50 to 70.28. Most countries with higher OHGI scores come from Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific and North America, while countries with the lower OHGI scores are almost from sub-Saharan Africa. Six countries scored more than 65 points, including Australia, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, the United States of America and Finland, indicating that these countries are relatively mature in most aspects of One Health governance. However, there were some developing countries with OHGI scored lower than 15. Therefore, the gap between countries with higher OHGI scores and those with lower OHGI scores is more than 60.ConclusionsGood governance on One Health is an important indicator to measure One Health's governance capacity. The political stability, the level of rule of law and economic conditions in different regions are significantly correlated with the One Health governance capacity. Actions need to be taken urgently to close the gap of One Health governance between different regions.

Abstract: Tropical protected areas have variable success in protecting their biodiversity. Many are experiencing biodiversity declines because of pressures such as logging, fire and hunting in their immediate surroundings, and inadequate protection inside the reserves. Here we assess how the national socio-economic context in which protected areas are embedded correlates with temporal trends in the condition of their biodiversity. Focussing on 60 protected areas arrayed across the world's major tropical regions, we examine the correlation between the biodiversity 'health' of protected areas and indices of human population size, wealth, governance quality, the environmental ranking of their respective nation, and national emphasis on reserve protection. We hypothesize that, after controlling for variability in socio-economic context, a country's emphasis on implementing high-protection reserves reduces the likelihood of biodiversity decline in its protected areas. We find that, after accounting for spatial non-independence and general socio-economic context, the best predictor of biodiversity trends within a tropical protected area is the country's overall emphasis on reserve quality, as measured by the proportion of IUCN Category I-IV reserves in nations' protected-area networks. This result suggests that national-level policies can have an important influence on the fate of biodiversity in tropical protected areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Climate change and water security have become the most challenging global issues of this era, especially for developing countries like Pakistan. Amid many hindrances, poor governance has been identified as one of the most pressing reasons for ineffective action to tackle multifaceted and integrative climate-water issues in Pakistan. This article, therefore, applied a systematic literature review methodology to examine the current climate-water governance archetype, including key areas, major elements, critical gaps, and potential strategy in Pakistan. This study found that key climate-water governance areas in Pakistan are: river basin and watershed management, agriculture and irrigation management, urban and domestic water issues, floods, droughts and disaster management, groundwater management, and transboundary management. Moreover, it is revealed that the major governance elements are political commitment and leadership, policy formulation and regulation, institutional capacity and coordination, stakeholder engagement, and resource management, technology, and infrastructure development. The article also discusses how Pakistan has not effectively employed most of the identified governance elements to tackle its climate-water problems, lacking mostly in political, policy, institutional, coordination, and infrastructure aspects. In conclusion, a four-dimensional governance strategy, encompassing leadership, policy, institutions, and stakeholders is proposed to improve water sector resilience and adaptation to combat climate change in Pakistan.

Abstract: Economic instruments for conservation are invoked as a strategy to achieve the dual goals of maintaining healthy ecosystems and improving human well-being. The outcomes of such instruments are highly variable and there has been limited analysis of their social outcomes. Economic instruments for conservation can create opportunity and political leverage for minority groups or reinforce pre-existing power relationships and reproduce socio-economic inequalities. This research examines the equity implications of a government scheme from Brazil known as an ecological fiscal transfer, looking at how institutional arrangements and local power dynamics influence the application of revenue to achieve social outcomes. A case study from the Atlantic forest explores whether the application of revenue reflects the interests of a broad community base and avoids elite capture, or if decision-making processes are engineered by local power actors to further specific interests. Results demonstrate how poor local institutional capacity limits the effective governance of the revenue, leading to limited positive social outcomes. Furthermore, incentives offered by the mechanism stimulate conservation activity which implies high costs for the rural poor. The application of a framework of good governance guides the development of recommendations for improving the social equity of ecological fiscal transfer policies. These findings reinforce the importance of the design of EFTS applied in regions of poverty, if they are to promote socially equitable conservation.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Why did Divisions of General Practice implement some Access to Allied Psychological Services mental health initiatives and not others?

Abstract: Objective The Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) programs implemented through Divisions of General Practice (now Medicare Locals) enables general practitioners (GPs) to refer consumers with high-prevalence mental disorders for up to 12 individual and/or group sessions of evidence-based mental health care. The great strength of ATAPS is its ability to target vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations. Several initiatives have been introduced that focus on particular at-risk populations. This study aimed to determine the factors that had influenced Divisions' decisions to implement the various Tier 2 initiatives. Methods An online survey was sent to all Divisions. The survey contained mostly multiple choice questions and sought to determine which factors had influenced their decision-making. Results The most common factors influencing the decision to implement an initiative were the perception of local need and whether there was an existing service model that made it easier to add in new programs. The most commonly cited factors for not implementing were related to resources and administrative capacity. Conclusions This research provides valuable insights into the issues that primary care organisations face when implementing new programs; the lessons learnt here could be useful when considering the implementation of other new primary care programs. What is known about the topic? Previous evaluations of ATAPS have shed light on some of the factors that act as barriers to the implementation of new mental health initiatives by Divisions operating in primary care, but there is nothing known about why Divisions choose to implement some programs over others. Previous research suggests that barriers' to change, as reported by organisations, may be constructions that are used to make sense of a situation and that the real impediment to change are intra-organisational factors such as the self-identity of organisations. What does this paper add? This paper reports on a survey that was undertaken with Divisions regarding the reasons they chose to implement particular mental health initiatives. The paper provides insight into the barriers that Divisions perceived when implementing new mental health programs. They were primarily cited as funding and resource barriers. The findings also provide further indirect evidence of the role of the self-identity of organisations in change. What are the implications for practitioners? The study has some implications for government policy development both locally and internationally. For instance, it is likely that primary care organisations such as Divisions, especially smaller ones, require support in terms of increased funding and resources if new mental health initiatives are to be successful. Mandating the delivering of initiatives also contributes to their successful uptake. It is likely that as primary care organisations become more experienced with implementing new mental health programs, the perceived barriers will reduce and implementation will occur with more ease.

Abstract: Global and human development and freedoms increasingly thrive on robust and policy-orientated research and related activities. Yet, the African research landscape faces a myr-iad of challenges which have resulted in a very unequal continent in terms of research and research capacity. The prevailing research inequities and challenges in Africa are even more pronounced in the social sciences, humanities, arts, and related fields (SSHA). Here, the strengths and impact of scholarship in SSHA fields are often overshadowed by deficits and apparent preferential investment in research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related fields. In response, the African Academy of Sciences commissioned a study in 2020 to generate evidence on the SSHA research support landscape in Africa. This paper summarizes findings from literature review, key informant interviews, a bibliomet-ric analysis, a survey with a sample of 670 respondents from SSHA communities in Africa, and a series of focus group discussions.

Abstract: The paper aims to identify pivotal predictors of cryptocurrency legal status in a sample of 134 countries, which includes jurisdictions where cryptocurrencies are legal as well as implicitly or explicitly banned. By applying the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for logit models and sparse group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to 26 candidate predictors, we find that higher values of voice and accountability index, capturing governance quality, increase the likelihood of free cryptocurrency circulation, whereas an enhanced access to electricity, conducive to intense cryptocurrency min-ing, produces the opposite effect. The latter may arise from the fact that regulators perceive an increased access to electricity as an early warning signal of excessive and, thus, speculative cryptocurrency activities in the future, thereby imposing preemptive regulatory restrictions. A battery of robustness checks confirm the relevance of voice and accountability index as well as access to electricity, also revealing digital adoption index, which promotes cryptocurrency legality, as their closest contender in terms of variable importance. Governments need to take into account the identified factors when shaping their regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. (c) 2020 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Security sector reform (SSR) policy has, for the better part of a decade, been viewed as instrumental to the larger international project of improving and strengthening the capacity' of post-conflict and fragile' states. The current policy approach, which represents a merging of security and development agendas in the post-Cold War era, is based on the premise that fragmented, ineffective, poorly managed and politicised state security institutions threaten political stability and undermine poverty reduction and sustainable development goals. The objective of this article is to examine aspects of what has been described as the SSR policy-practice gap' that arose in the course of implementing SSR policy in Timor-Leste by analysing the systemic basis of the gap. An analytical framework that untangles the relationship between SSR policy objectives, targets and outcomes is presented in concert with a discussion of the social and political circumstances that confronted international organisations and donor countries when they sought to implement SSR policy in Timor-Leste. By using the analytical framework to assess the policy coherence between SSR objectives and the SSR programme contained in UN Security Council Resolution 1704, the ubiquitous disconnect between SSR Gospel and Reality' is pulled more sharply into focus.

Abstract: The financial crisis that erupted in East Asia in mid-1997 has renewed the long-standing debate concerning the relationship between financial liberalization and financial crises, effectively dividing this debate into two opposing camps. On one side stand those who view the crisis as the result of insufficient financial liberalization and the legacies of an economic model in which the state plays an active role in the allocation of economic resources to strategically designated ends. On the other side stand those who identify excessive financial liberalization and increased exposure to volatile capital flows as the primary cause of the crisis. This paper argues that the question around which the current debate centres - of whether too little or too much financial liberalization was to blame for the crisis - is particularly unfruitful, as it overlooks the fact that there is move than one path to liberalization. A more fruitful question to pose is what kind of liberalization can deliver the benefits of access to the opportunities of the 'global' marketplace whilst still maintaining the domestic foundations for economic growth and stability? The paper seeks to sited some preliminary light on this question through a comparative analysis of financial liberalization in Korea and Taiwan, and the way in which variations in their approaches determined their relative resiliency during the recent turmoil.

Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which Malaysia's most recent public service reform has improved service delivery and governmental performance. It also endeavors to identify critical success factors that explain reform performance and draw lessons based on the Malaysian experience. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a case study approach and draws on data from both primary and secondary sources. Besides a thorough review of official documents and existing literature, the author conducted 20 individual interviews with key informants representing government officials, academics and civil society organizations. Findings - The study shows that despite some pitfalls and misgivings, the Government Transformation Program (GTP) has produced concrete improvements in service delivery areas where previous reforms failed. One of the factors that underpin GTP's relative success is the detailed performance management framework, which helped foster inter-agency collaboration and enforce accountability for results at various levels. Practical implications - The GTP success highlights the significance of adapting reform content to local situations especially when reforms are based on external models; sanctions from the highest political office; a dedicated unit to drive the implementation and an effective performance management framework through which individuals and agencies would be held to account for results achieved. Originality/value - Despite many and varied reform initiatives attempted in the past, cases of successful reform are rare, especially in developing countries. Little is known on what makes a reform work, a gap exacerbated by notable absence of systematic research on this topic. The paper contributes to address this by reviewing Malaysia's innovative approach to reform and the insights that the Malaysian experience offers.

Abstract: Background Evidence has revealed that nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were effective in attenuating the spread of COVID-19. However, policymakers have encountered difficulty in identifying the most effective policies under different circumstances. This study investigated the relative effectiveness of different NPIs and vaccination in prolonging COVID-19 case doubling time (DT). Methods The study sample consisted of observations from 137 countries during 1 January 2020 to 13 June 2021. DT was calculated on a daily basis per country. Data were retrieved from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, World Development Indicators, and Worldwide Governance Indicators. To capture policy intervention dynamics, we combined a random-effect growth-curve model with non-standard interrupted time series analysis. We also evaluated the association of policy measures with DT for different outbreak stages and levels of government effectiveness. Results: Vaccine rollouts, workplace closures, and school closures were relatively effective. For each day that these measures were implemented, the DT increased by 1.96% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.63 to 3.29; P = 0.004), 1.41% (95% CI = 0.88 to 1.95%; P < 0.001) and 1.38% (95% CI = 0.95 to 1.81%; P < 0.001), respectively. Workplace and school closures were positively associated with DT at all stages; however, the associations weakened in later stages, where vaccine rollouts appeared to be most effective in prolonging DT (95% CI = 1.51% to 3.04%; P < 0.05). For countries with a high level of government effectiveness, most of the containment measures evaluated were effective; vaccine rollouts had the greatest effect size. For countries with medium or low levels of government effectiveness, only the closure of workplaces was consistently associated with prolonged DT. Conclusions The effectiveness of vaccine rollouts outweighed that of NPIs, especially in the later outbreak stages. However, vaccination was not associated with prolonged case DT in countries with lower levels of government effectiveness, probably due to low vaccine coverage. Among the NPIs examined, workplace closures were highly effective across all outbreak stages and levels of government effectiveness. Our findings suggest that mass vaccination is critical to reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially in countries where NPIs are less effective.

Abstract: Research on the social licence to operate (SLO) has traditionally focused on local communities directly affected by mining operations. There has been a lack of systematic research exploring attitudes to mining among the public at large. Based on a national survey (N = 1091) of Finns' attitudes towards mining conducted in 2016, we test a theoretical model using path analysis to examine the factors affecting the social licence to operate (SLO) of mining in Finland. The aim is to shed light on the factors affecting SLO at national level in Finland and to add to the growing body of research seeking to understand the mining industry's SLO at national level in diverse social, economic and political settings. The results show that among the Finnish public the factors having the greatest influence on the mining SLO (directly or indirectly) are balance of benefits over impacts, governance capacity, procedural fairness, distributive fairness, resource nationalism and trust in the mining industry. Our findings support the crucial role of trust for SLO, but additionally highlight the importance of balance over benefits. The results suggest that building trust and SLO requires more than just the actions of either the industry or governments alone - a social licence requires joint efforts.

Abstract: There is a considerable evidence showing that many states in the Global South are very weak, and therefore struggle to carry out basic responsibilities of statehood. While a handful of studies have examined problems associated with state weakness, there is a paucity of scholarly literature that thoroughly explores its empirical implications on regional security. It is on this note that this article draws on the contemporary developments in the Lake Chad region to elucidate the nodes that connect state weakness and regional security instability. It argues that any state that cannot efficaciously control its borders, promptly respond to security emergencies and demonstrate substantial institutional capacity in addressing citizens' needs is vulnerable to create regional insecurity, especially when the neighbouring states share similar attributes. The article concludes that an alternative approach to ensuring lasting regional security in such regions, especially in the present Lake Chad region, is deliberate commitment to state-building.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI), institutional quality and human development) in host countries from 2002 to 2019, using the Human Development Index [HDI] as the measure of human development. This study utilized a panel dataset of 143 countries, including both developed and developing economies, over a 17-year period. Additionally, the study employed a GMM (generalized method of moments) estimator to address unobservable heterogeneity and simultaneity. This study reveals a significant positive relationship between FDI and human development, with a stronger effect observed in developing countries compared to in developed countries. Notably, the impact of FDI-HDI nexus is larger in countries with moderately high-quality institutions, irrespective of their income level. Furthermore, good governance plays a crucial role in enhancing human development, as developing economies with high governance quality experience a greater impact of FDI on HDI compared to other countries. The findings of this study suggest that attracting FDI can be beneficial for enhancing the HDI, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the study highlights governance as a moderating factor in the relationship between FDI and HDI. Improving governance quality can enhance the positive impact of FDI on human development in host countries, especially in developing countries.

Abstract: Objective We sought to test hypotheses regarding the principal correlates of child-health performance among African nations based on previous evidence collected at finer spatial scales. Design Retrospective, cross-sectional study. Setting All countries in Africa, excluding small-island nations. Primary and secondary outcome measures We defined a composite child-health indicator for each country comprising the incidence of stunting, deaths from respiratory disease, deaths from diarrhoeal disease, deaths from other infectious disease and deaths from injuries for children aged under 5 years. We also compiled national-level data for Africa to test the effects of country-level water quality, air pollution, food supply, breast feeding, environmental performance, per capita wealth, healthcare investment, population density and governance quality on the child-health indicator. Results Across nations, child health was lowest when water quality, improved sanitation, air quality and environmental performance were lowest. There was also an important decline in child health as household size (a proxy for population density) increased. The remaining variables had only weak effects, but in the directions we hypothesised. Conclusions These results emphasise the importance of continued investment in clean water and sanitation services, measures to improve air quality and efforts to restrict further environmental degradation, to promote the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3 target to '... end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5' and Goal 6 to '... ensure access to water and sanitation for all' by 2030.

Abstract: There is a growing need to develop and implement new forms of governance that respond to the increasing complexity of decision making and balance the roles of government and local citizens. Localism is (re)emerging as an alternative to traditional top-down' governance strategies which are criticised for their failure to adequately respond to the diversity of community needs. This article uses two case studies to explore how localism works in practice, the Tasmanian Drought Support Network and the Tasmanian Forest Agreement. Four dimensions of adaptive governance are used to critically identify the benefits and limitations of localism as a governance approach, exploring the approaches capacity for social and economic entrepreneurship, governance quality and the utilisation and enhancement of individual capacities. These empirical findings will help policy makers and community members better understand localism and guide the development of theory around localism and its future practice.

Abstract: We study the impact of internal corporate governance on performance during the current financial crisis for a comprehensive cross-country sample of 4046 publicly traded non-financial firms from the U.S. and 22 developed countries. Using a broad-based index of corporate governance quality, we find that well governed firms do not outperform poorly governed firms. We explore three potential explanations for the lack of significant impact of corporate governance quality on performance. First, we examine whether cross-country differences in institutional development have an impact on the effect of corporate governance on performance. Second, we investigate whether a narrowing down of the informationally efficient segment of the stock markets during the crisis can explain the results. We do not find support for either of these conjectures. Finally, we examine whether stock markets generally became less efficient in incorporating firm-specific information into stock prices during the crisis. Our empirical evidence is consistent with the latter view that during the crisis stock markets in developed countries became less efficient in incorporating firm-specific information into prices.

Abstract: Indicator-based frameworks for assessing the sustainability of commercial fisheries have become well-established in the consumer sector. Within fisheries management, there are only a few jurisdictions, notably Australia, where sustainability frameworks are regularly used across the full spectrum of management functions, including planning, decision making, and evaluation. In Canada, a "sustainable fisheries framework" has been proposed but implementation has been limited to date. The Canadian Fisheries Research Network (CFRN), a six-year collaboration between Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the commercial fishing industry, and academic institutions, included as one of its major outputs the development of a comprehensive framework-based approach to evaluate the sustainability of commercial fisheries in Canada. Although most fisheries sustainability frameworks focus on the ecological domain, the CFRN explicitly recognized the social, economic, and institutional domains as having equal importance in a holistic treatment of sustainability. Following an iterative research and development process, a subgroup within the CFRN produced a novel sustainability indicator framework that combines a hierarchical subject matter structure consisting of domains, dimensions, and elements with a formula approach to developing indicators that utilizes a system of variables, or attributes. These two aspects of the sustainability indicator framework are linked in a way that helps to enforce comprehensive and routine methods for identifying objectives and relating those to specific indicators. The careful balancing of scope and depth makes for a powerful tool that can be used across a range of fisheries management contexts within Canada and in other jurisdictions that have a similar governance structure and high degree of institutional capacity. We present a detailed account of how the sustainability indicator framework was developed, the logic of its construction, and its potential application in fisheries management.

Abstract: Co-production is currently promoted by governments as a response to public service reform in conditions of austerity and, within a neoliberal ideology, to compel individual and collective responsibility. While co-production is intuitively attractive in its appeal to community collectivism and provision of locally appropriate services, there is a lack of reflection on the actual capacity of rural communities to become co-producers. This study considers co-production as a form of participation requiring attributes of volunteering and social involvement. It applies a model of formal participation with 5 levels from attendance at community events to organising new services, in order to assess the potential for service co-production by rural older people in 6 Scottish settlements. We find that rural older people are already heavily participating in community activities but with lower numbers taking part in the activities that require higher levels of commitment. It is the most well 'resourced' in terms of personal characteristics such as education that are most likely to participate. There are few older people who are willing to help their community that are not already involved in formal participation. Overall, findings suggest there is a very small potential pool of non-involved rural older residents who are willing to participate at high levels of commitment (co-production). Further research is now needed to build on these findings, and particularly to explore what it is that will encourage those already involved at some level to step up to co-production.

Abstract: The ability of urban centres in developing countries to rapidly transition to sustainable practises will be critical for human health and environmental sustainability as the world progresses into the twenty-first century. Sustain ability transitions in the urban water sector in developing countries have received limited scholarly attention, with very few studies demonstrating methodologies offering potential for promoting and enabling "leapfrog" transitions. This paper presents an adapted transition management process which demonstrates the importance of establishing a future vision and strategic agenda for promoting a leapfrogging trajectory. Utilising the case study of the urban water sector in Port Vila, Vanuatu, empirical evidence draws from transition management workshops, supported by in-depth interviews and mediated participation. Results suggest that the desire in Vanuatu is for the development of a sustainable urban water future, and that there is untapped latent energy which can be better utilised to assist in guiding the direction of change and promoting sustainable alternatives. The paper concludes by providing critical insights into enabling leapfrogging in other developing contexts highlighting the importance of targeted institutional capacity development, the role of purchaser provider relationships between governments and international development banks, and the potential for visions to stimulate leapfrogging trajectories.

Abstract: Tropical countries are important to conservation because of the threats to the high levels of biodiversity there, but research on conservation science in these mostly developing countries has traditionally been written by foreigners. This disconnect could have serious implications for the practice of conservation, as local scientists can be more effective than foreigners in interacting with practitioners or pushing forward conservation action themselves. These scientists' careers are strengthened by participation in the international literature, and their knowledge about conservation's success in their country provides necessary feedback to the theoretical literature. We assess the past and current status of geographic diversity in the international conservation literature, over 30 years and in comparison to other fields, as well as present acceptance rate data from prominent journals, broken down by the country of corresponding authorship. While the proportion of articles in all fields contributed by low and medium income countries increases over time, the percentage of conservation articles contributed by corresponding authors from low income countries is actually declining. Manuscripts by authors from low income countries were less than half as likely to be published as those from high income countries. We present a list of specific policies that journals can implement to reverse these trends, such as having regional editors, providing editing assistance, waiving fees, and seeking locally focused studies from which globally relevant strategies and lessons can be drawn. We also stress that long-term the problem can best be addressed by funding educational institutions that develop young researchers in the tropics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Water-management practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta have predominantly focused on structural development (e.g., dykes) to support rice-based agricultural production. Given the existing conventional approach, however, many of these efforts have been rendered ineffective . This study adopts the policy transfer concept to investigate how the participatory approach is introduced into the local institutional system, and how it shapes the construction, operation and management of the North Vam Nao scheme. Results suggest that this allowed stakeholders to engage collaboratively in these processes.

Abstract: In the last 30 years, environmental challenges in the Asia-Pacific have gone from sitting at the margins of political discourse to featuring prominently in academic and policy debates about institutional capacity, economic sustainability and regional futures. Those challenges are extensive: they include loss of biodiversity and species, land degradation and deforestation, water pollution and scarcity, drought, wildlife smuggling, ozone depletion, other forms of atmospheric pollution, and climate change. This article explores regional responses to environmental challenges through a global governance lens. It examines the ways in which vertical and intergovernmental arrangements have been supplemented by institutions and networks that reflect horizontal and transnational approaches. It reveals that this has been an uneven process, with coherence and fragmentation equally represented. In its focus on the two key subregions of Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia, it shows how environmental cooperation has been implicated in a crisis of regionalism and caught up in states' efforts to demonstrate that governance can still be effective in the absence of binding multilateral agreements.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The historical sociology of the state and the state of historical sociology in international relations

Abstract: With the current concern to critique neorealism, international relations (IR) theorists are looking to a variety of new perspectives as a way forward. Various authors have taken a specific interest in Weberian historical sociology (WHS), outlined in the works of Michael Mann and others. Nevertheless, there is currently only a rudimentary understanding of the approach within IR, and perhaps even less understanding of how it can be applied to LR. There is also a growing perception that the approach is inherently realist. This article seeks to redress this. It begins by laying out the basic WHS approach by identifying six general principles or traits. Special emphasis is given to recent developments in WHS's theory of state autonomy, which takes the approach beyond neorealism. Having considered how this approach overlaps with the concerns of various IR theorists, notably Linklater, Halliday and others, it proceeds to examine how the approach can take IR beyond neorealism, by applying it to understanding: international economic change through a historical examination of tariff protectionism and free trade; the international politics of states, war and revolution; and international systems change (namely European industrialization). It concludes with a possible historical sociology research agenda for the study of IR.

Abstract: "Political will" is oft-cited as the major obstacle to government's anti-corruption efforts. Notwithstanding, there is remarkably little systematic analysis of the concept, with some scholars describing it as the slipperiest concept in the policy lexicon, whereas others are calling for its empirical relevance. This paper tries to unpack the black box of political will by making it an empirically relevant concept drawing on evidence from two Asian countries; Singapore and Bangladesh. Four key indicators based on the works of earlier scholars are used including origin of the initiative; comprehension and extent of analysis; credible sanctions; and resource dedication and sustenance are used. The paper also uses Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, World Bank's World Governance Indicators (Control of Corruption and Government Effectiveness), and Political, Economic and Risk Consultancy's annual survey in Asia, as outcome measures. Based on the empirical evidence from the two countries, the paper shows that political will indeed has a positive influence on government's anti-corruption efforts. Although political will may not be sufficient, it is a necessary condition to fight corruption, and that the difference between the positions of Singapore and Bangladesh on various global corruption league tables may be attributed to political will.

Abstract: According to the theory of environmental governance, we try to uncover the impact of governance quality on environmental protection by employing cross-country level data for 164 countries during the period of 2002-2019 via GMM estimation. The baseline estimation indicates that better governance would benefit for the environmental protection, which is credibility when we conducted robustness tests by changing measurements of governance, environmental performance and setting new sub-samples. In addition, we also query that whether the governance's positive impact on environmental protection varies among different countries, supporting that the industrial structure, economic growth, urbanization, trade openness, digital economy as well as the characteristic of left-wing ideology would weaken the governance's positive impact on environmental protection. Similarly, while there exist extreme weather events such as earthquakes, epidemics, floods, and storms, the governance quality's positive impact on environmental performance would be lower. Finally, better quality of governance can lead to a better environmental performance by improving the energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy.

Abstract: The demand for renewable energy is growing worldwide due to environmental degradation. However, in poor countries, the use of renewable energy may be impeded by the level of poverty and income inequality. Therefore, this paper studies the income inequality impact on renewable energy demand in seven South Asian economies by using the balanced panel data from 1996 to 2018. The study employs generalized methods of moments (GMM) estimation technique followed by other econometric approaches to check the robustness of findings. The renewable energy demand function includes economic growth, carbon emissions, and government effectiveness as control variables. The study has found the adverse effects of income inequality, economic growth, and carbon emissions on renewable energy demand. Government effectiveness also drives renewable energy use. The findings are robust and reliable concerning panel data methods used in the analysis. These findings bear important policies for a sustainable environment in South Asian economies.

Abstract: Background: Workplace violence prevalence has attracted significant attention within the international nursing literature. Little attention to non-mental health settings and a lack of evaluation rigor have been identified within review literature. Objectives: To examine the effects of a workplace violence training program in relation to risk assessment and management practices, de-escalation skills, breakaway techniques, and confidence levels, within an acute hospital setting. Design: A quasi-experimental study of nurses using pretest-posttest measurements of educational objectives and confidence levels, with two week follow-up. Setting: A 440 bed metropolitan tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants: Nurses working in specialties identified as a 'high risk' for violence. Method: A pre-post-test design was used with participants attending a one day workshop. The workshop evaluation comprised the use of two validated questionnaires: the Continuing Professional Development Reaction questionnaire, and the Confidence in Coping with Patient Aggression Instrument. Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. The paired t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of changes in the clinical behaviour intention and confidence scores from pre-to post-intervention. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated to determine the extent of the significant results. Results: Seventy-eight participants completed both pre- and post-workshop evaluation questionnaires. Statistically significant increases in behaviour intention scores were found in fourteen of the fifteen constructs relating to the three broad workshop objectives, and confidence ratings, with medium to large effect sizes observed in some constructs. A significant increase in overall confidence in coping with patient aggression was also found post-test with large effect size. Conclusions: Positive results were observed from the workplace violence training. Training needs to be complimented by a multi-faceted organisational approach which includes governance, quality and review processes.

Abstract: Background: The Rwanda Human Resources for Health Program (HRH Program) is a 7-year (2012-2019) health professional training initiative led by the Government of Rwanda with the goals of training a large, diverse, and competent health workforce and strengthening the capacity of academic institutions in Rwanda. Methods: The data for this organizational case study was collected through official reports from the Rwanda Ministry of Health (MoH) and 22 participating US academic institutions, databases from the MoH and the College of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS) in Rwanda, and surveys completed by the co-authors. Results: In the first 5 years of the HRH Program, a consortium of US academic institutions has deployed an average of 99 visiting faculty per year to support 22 training programs, which are on track to graduate almost 4600 students by 2019. The HRH Program has also built capacity within the CMHS by promoting the recruitment of Rwandan faculty and the establishment of additional partnerships and collaborations with the US academic institutions. Conclusion: The milestones achieved by the HRH Program have been substantial although some challenges persist. These challenges include adequately supporting the visiting faculty; pairing them with Rwandan faculty (twinning); ensuring strong communication and coordination among stakeholders; addressing mismatches in priorities between donors and implementers; the execution of a sustainability strategy; and the decision by one of the donors not to renew funding beyond March 2017. Over the next 2 academic years, it is critical for the sustainability of the 22 training programs supported by the HRH Program that the health-related Schools at the CMHS significantly scale up recruitment of new Rwandan faculty. The HRH Program can serve as a model for other training initiatives implemented in countries affected by a severe shortage of health professionals.

Abstract: Fisheries governance systems designed to regulate fishing are often described as being highly diverse across countries. However, there is little systematic work that directly examines and describes the (dis)similarities across such systems, and how socio-political and economic contexts drive such variation at a global scale. In this paper, we use 68 indicators from a novel dataset to examine the fisheries governance systems in place to constrain overfishing in national waters across 142 countries. We found that countries cluster in just two distinct governance groups which display different traits to constrain overfishing. Where one group takes a tougher stance on aspects regarding access to its fisheries resources, the other is more focused on gathering fisheries information and publicizing the data. The 10 greatest differences between groups relate to the gathering of information and monitoring of their fisheries, the effectiveness of compliance systems and the existence of policies around sustainability. On these key differences, one group consistently displays more far-reaching governance traits. The overall governance capacity of a country and the national socio-economic importance of fisheries are identified as potential drivers of this variation. Despite their differences, the two groups show substantial overlap for many indicators, particularly those that are inexpensive, but also for certain costly policies. These patterns prompt hypotheses of policy transfer or convergence across fisheries governance systems, most notably regarding 'low-hanging fruit' policies.

Abstract: Assessment of the quality of governance has so far relied on socioeconomic statistics and expert opinions, while largely neglecting citizens' perceptions. Using Asia Barometer 2008 data, this paper examines the factors affecting citizens' satisfaction with their government in six Asian-Pacific countries: America, Australia, China, India, Japan, and Russia. I found citizen satisfaction with the public services they receive, such as education, healthcare, and public safety, matters most in their assessment of government performance. Individual satisfaction with income, job, and housing also matters. The respondent will disapprove government performance if he or she thinks corruption is serious in government, or elected officials stop caring about citizens once voting is finished. In terms of macro variables, economic condition of a country seems to matters significantly. Especially, if a country's economy is growing fast, citizens are much more likely to be satisfied with government performance. Large within-country variations exist in countries such as China and India, where citizens of different cities or regions may give rather different assessments of government, suggesting many contextual variables not captured by this study. Lastly, citizens' satisfaction with government performance seems to be highly divergent from international organizations' evaluation of governance quality, such as the World Bank Governance Index. This raises both methodological and normative issues regarding the proper approaches to measuring good governance.

Abstract: An unprecedented number of firms announced CEO salary reductions at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. We document that the total compensation for these CEOs did not actually decrease but was instead restructured, leading to a marked increase in opaque components of compensation. These adjustments align with the managerial power view of executive pay setting, whereby heightened stakeholder outrage prompts greater camouflaging of compensation to avoid scrutiny. We further show that this pattern of compensation adjustments predominantly occurred in firms with powerful CEOs, weak institutional investor monitoring, and poorer governance quality.

Abstract: This paper examines the effect of female directors on corporate debt maturity structures. We find that firms with a higher ratio of female directors tend to have a larger proportion of short-maturity debt. This effect is more pronounced with female independent directors and is insignificant with female inside directors. These findings remain robust under propensity score matching and instrumental variable approaches to address potential endogeneity concerns. Furthermore, we find that our results are driven primarily by firms with weak governance quality and low financial constraints. We also find that the effect does not differ between high- and low-leveraged firms, and there is a negative relation between female directors and likelihood of overinvestment. This evidence suggests that female directors view short-term debt as a monitoring device.

Here, we employ a systematic literature review to map the nature of inquiry and institutional context of pest management science in 65 low- and middle-income countries published from 2010 to 2020. Despite large inter-country variability, any given country generates an average of 5.9 publications per annum (range 0-45.9) and individual nations such as Brazil, Kenya, Benin, Vietnam, and Turkey engage extensively in regional cooperation. International development partners are prominent scientific actors in West Africa but are commonly outpaced by national institutions and foreign academia in other regions. Transnational institutions such as the CGIAR represent a 1.4-fold higher share of studies on host plant resistance but lag in public interest science disciplines such as biological control. Despite high levels of scientific abstraction, research conducted jointly with development partners shows real yet marginal improvements in incorporating the multiple (social-ecological) layers of the farming system. Added emphasis on integrative system-level approaches and agroecological or biodiversity-driven measures can extend the reach of science to unlock transformative change.

Abstract: In 2005, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mongolia initiated the process of developing its Health Sector Strategic Master Plan (HSSMP), using a wide-ranging consultative process, driven by the MoH, and requiring participation from all levels of health facilities, other ministries, donor agencies and NGOs. Among other objectives, the MoH sought to coordinate the disparate inputs from key donors through the HSSMP, aligning them with the Plan's structure. This research explores the extent to which the HSSMP process served as a mechanism for effective aid coordination while promoting ownership and capacity building and the lessons learned for the wider international development community. The study is based on document review, key-informant interviews and authors' experience and participation in the MoH planning processes. The HSSMP process improved alignment and harmonisation. It enabled a better local understanding of the benefits of aid coordination, and the recognition that aid coordination as not only a mere administrative task, but a strategic step towards comprehensive management of both domestic and external resources. The process was not challenge free; the fractious political environment, the frequent turnover of key MoH staff, the resistance of some donors towards MoH scrutiny over their programmes and the dismantling of the central coordination and return of seconded staff following completion of the HSSMP, has slowed the pace of reform. Despite the challenges, the approach resulted in positive outcomes in the areas of ownership and better aid coordination, with HSSMP development emphasising ownership and capacity building. This contrasted with the usual outcomes focus, and neglect of the capacity building learning processes and structural and policy changes needed to ensure sustainable change. The largest and most influential programmes in the health sector are now largely aligned with HSSMP strategies, enabling the MoH to utilize these opportunities to optimise the HSSMP outcomes. The lessons for Ministries of Health in similar Post-Soviet countries-or other emerging economies where government capacity and local policy processes are relatively strong-are clear: the development of solid governance and technical infrastructure in terms of planning and evaluation provide a solid structure for donor coordination and insure against local political change.

Abstract: Introduction The 2023 World Health Assembly resolution 76.18 committed the World Health Organization to the coordination of drowning prevention efforts, including those of United Nations (UN) agencies. Here, we aim to map drowning prevention linkages across UN Agency agendas, make recommendations to guide global strategies and inform the development of the Global Alliance and a Global Strategy for drowning prevention.Methods We applied a qualitative multimethod approach, including document review, key informant interviews, an interagency workshop and international conference panel discussion, to refine data and create our recommendations. We developed a framework to identify intersections between health and sustainable development agendas and applied it to map intersections and opportunities for the integration of drowning prevention across relevant UN Agency agendas.Results Our framework categorised intersections for drowning prevention in UN Agendas according to potential for (a) shared understandings of problems and solutions, (b) shared capacities, guidelines and resources and (c) shared governance and strategic pathways, noting that some factors overlap. We present our Position, Add, Reach and Reframe approach to outlining opportunities for the integration of drowning prevention in health and sustainable development agendas. Our results emphasise the importance of establishing approaches to the Global Alliance and Global Strategy that ensure high-level political advocacy is converted into solutions for affected communities. We recommend using research to inform effective action, building capacity and best practices, and promoting evaluation frameworks to incentivise and verify progress.Conclusion Our study identifies opportunities to expand drowning prevention efforts and to build Member State capacity to reduce drowning risk through evidence-informed measures that address vulnerabilities, exposures, hazards and build population-level resilience to drowning. Our framework for identifying opportunities for integration of drowning prevention across a multisectoral set of agendas offers a research and policy toolkit that may prove useful for other policy areas.

Abstract: Since the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, there has been much discussion about whether the international community has moved into a new post-Westphalian era, where states increasingly recognize certain shared norms that guide what they ought to do in responding to infectious disease outbreaks. In this article I identify this new obligation as the 'duty to report', and examine competing accounts on the degree to which states appreciate this new obligation are considered by examining state behaviour during the H5N1 human infectious outbreaks in East Asia (since 2004). The article examines reporting behaviour for H5N1 human infectious cases in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam from 2004 to 2010. The findings lend strong support to the claim that East Asian states have come to accept and comply with the duty to report infectious disease outbreaks and that the assertions of sovereignty in response to global health governance frameworks have not systematically inhibited reporting compliance.

Abstract: Global seafood sourcing networks are expanding to meet demand. To describe contemporary fishery expansion patterns, we analyzed the worldwide exploitation of sea cucumber (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) traded via Hong Kong for consumers in China. In just 15 years (1996-2011), the sea cucumber sourcing network expanded from 35 to 83 countries; sea cucumber fisheries serving the Chinese market now operate within countries cumulatively spanning over 90% of the world's tropical coastlines. The emergence of such fisheries in nations where they were previously absent could not be explained either by their national governance capacity or by their distance from Hong Kong. Surging imports from these new fisheries have compensated for declines in long-standing fisheries elsewhere. The case of commercial sea cucumber trade for the Chinese market exemplifies a new global extraction phenomenon that we call contagious resource exploitation - a fast-moving system resembling a disease epidemic, where long-distance transport expedites large-scale expansion followed by diffusive local spread into neighboring areas. Multi-level and multi-scale decision making is urgently needed to control and mitigate the effects of contagious exploitation.

Abstract: Political dynamics across scales are often overlooked in the design, implementation and evaluation of environmental governance. We provide new evidence to explain how interactions between international organizations and national governments shape environmental governance and outcomes for 238 World Heritage ecosystems, on the basis of a new intervention-response-outcome typology. We analyse interactions between the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and 102 national governments responsible for implementing ecosystem protection under the World Heritage Convention between 1972 and 2019. We combine data on the reporting, deliberation and certification of individual ecosystem-level threats, with data on national governance quality, economic complexity and key stakeholder perspectives. We find that the extent of threatened ecosystems is seriously underestimated and that efforts to formally certify threatened ecosystems are often resisted by national governments. A range of responses to international intervention, including both productive and counterproductive responses, generates material impacts at the ecosystem level. Counterproductive responses occur in nations dependent on limited high-value natural resource industries, irrespective of overall level of economic development. We identify new political approaches to improve environmental governance, including how to overcome the problem of regulatory capture. Our findings inform how we can better anticipate and account for political dynamics in environmental governance. Interaction between international organizations and national governments over 238 World Heritage ecosystems shows patterns of productive and counterproductive dynamics, which yield lessons to improve environmental governance.

Abstract: Focusing on the toughest-ever environmental policy in China, this paper investigates the causal evidence of how environmental regulations influence listed firms' capital structure dynamics. The difference-in-difference estimation findings showed that the speed of leverage adjustment of highly polluting firms significantly declined after the implementation of tightened environmental regulations, compared with that of low -polluting firms. The dynamics of this impact turned out to be significant instantly after the policy shock and persisted for at least two years. Furthermore, the negative impact of environmental regulations on the speed of leverage adjustment by highly polluting firms was much weaker for firms with better corporate governance capacity and stronger for firms with higher information asymmetry. This study also identified that the possible channel of these main findings is that the cost of the debt and equity of highly polluting firms significantly increased after the implementation of the environmental regulations. Additional findings suggested that the tightened environmental regulations mitigated the speed of leverage adjustment of highly polluting firms because they increased these firms' adjustment costs. All main empirical findings passed a variety of endogeneity tests, including propensity score matching difference-in-difference and the inclusion of province fixed effects. These findings were also consistent across a battery of robustness tests, such as an alternative indicator of highly polluting industries, an alternative estimator of the speed of leverage adjustment, the extension of the sample period, and placebo tests with falsified event dates.(c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Abstract: Governance has many dimensions - corporate governance pertains to the firm's management whilst sovereign-governance pertains to the firm's exposure to sovereign risk, corruption, and poor regulation. We show that both are important drivers of firm value and this has serious implications for the increasing number of Chinese firms choosing to cross-list in the USA. Whilst the legal bonding hypothesis argues that firms from poor-corporate governance environments can signal their quality by issuing stock in the USA it is silent on the role of sovereign-governance. Thus, we use a sample of cross-listed firms from 48 countries between 1996 and 2008 and find that the home-country's sovereign-governance quality, but not its corporate governance quality (as proxied by the Anti-director Rights Index) continue to influence the market values of cross-listed firms. Furthermore, cross-listed firms from strong-governance countries have higher market values than non-cross-listed firms or firms from weak governance countries. These results highlight the importance of distinguishing between the myriad types of governance when analysing the bonding hypothesis and the drivers of cross-listed stocks' valuations, and emphasize the continued importance of sovereign-governance for cross-listed firms.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the pervasive impacts on global fishery resources caused by stressors such as overfishing and climate change could dramatically increase the likelihood of fishery conflict. However, existing projections do not consider wider economic, social, or political trends when assessing the likelihood of, and influences on, future conflict trajectories. In this paper, we build four future fishery conflict scenarios by considering multiple fishery conflict drivers derived from an expert workshop, a longitudinal database of international fishery conflict, secondary data on conflict driver trends, and regional expert reviews. The scenarios take place between the years 2030 and 2060 in the North-East Atlantic ("scramble for the Atlantic''), the East China Sea ("the remodeled empire''), the coast of West Africa ("oceanic decolonization''), and the Arctic ("polar renaissance''). The scenarios explore the implications of ongoing trends in conflict-prone regions of the world and function as accessible, science-based communication tools that can help foster anticipatory governance capacity in the pursuit of future ocean security.

Abstract: Few studies have explored the influence of horizontal (i.e., among group) inequalities on terrorism, yet it seems plausible that these inequalities may be relevant. Employing data from the Global Terrorism Database and Ethnologue, this article examines the effect of ethnic economic inequality on domestic terrorism for 130 countries over the period 2001 to 2018. We present evidence that higher degrees of ethnic inequality lead to higher numbers of terrorist attacks as well as a higher number of people killed or injured. This positive association between ethnic inequality and terrorism is robust to alternative measures of ethnic inequality, omission of influential countries and regions, the inclusion and exclusion of controls, and alternative estimation strategies. In contrast, countries with high degree of political freedom and high governance quality tend to suffer less from terrorism. Promoting economic equality among ethnic groups, therefore, has the potential to reduce the risk of domestic terrorism. We propose that a critical step towards promoting this equality is to enhance social inclusion. The benefits of increasing social inclusion extend beyond simply reducing the incidence of terrorism and inter-racial violence; creating a socially inclusive society is a social justice imperative and the responsibility of policymakers, social institutions, civil society, and the private sector. It is also consistent with the notion of inclusive economic growth, as championed by organizations such as the OECD and the United Nations Development Program.

Abstract: Background: Recent complex and cross-boundary policy problems, such as climate change, pandemics, and financial crises, have recentred debates about state capacity, democratic discontent and the 'crisis of expertise'. These problems are contested and open to redefinition, misunderstanding, spin, and deception, challenging the ability of policymakers to locate, discriminate, comprehend, and respond to competing sources of knowledge and expertise. We argue that 'non-knowledge' is an under-explored aspect of responses to major policy crises.Key points: While discussed in recent work in sociology and other social sciences, non-knowledge has been given less explicit attention in policy studies, and is not fully captured by orthodox understandings of knowledge and evidence use. We outline three main forms of non-knowledge that challenge public agencies: amnesia, ignorance and misinformation. In each case, 'non-knowledge' is not simply the absence of policy-relevant knowledge. Amnesia refers to what is forgotten, reinvented or 'unlearned', while claims of ignorance involve obscuring or casting aside of relevant knowledge that could (or even should) be available. To be misinformed is to actively believe false or misleading information. In each instance, non-knowledge may have strategic value for policy actors or aid the pursuit of self-interest.Conclusions and implications: We demonstrate the relevance of non-knowledge through a brief case study, emerging from the inquiry into the COVID-19 hotel quarantine programme in the Australian state of Victoria. We argue that both amnesia and 'practical' forms of ignorance contributed to failures during the early part of the programme.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems are subject to a range of likely impacts from drivers of environmental change, including human-induced climate change that is warming sea surface temperatures, altering ocean chemistry and affecting run-off of land-based pollutants and sediments. Such transformations will challenge the adequacy of governance and management regimes for conserving marine biodiversity. Assessment of the fitness of current governance and management regimes to meet the challenges, including their adaptive capacity, can be established through an understanding of what is required for an effective response. We provide such a foundation by identifying governance and management requirements that would support the resilience of marine biodiversity and ecosystems and associated social-ecological systems. The requirements were established through an expert panel methodology in conjunction with an analysis of relevant literature. We explain the relevance of these requirements to marine biodiversity conservation in a changing climate under the following themes: systems understanding, networks and learning; values and world views; institutional forms; leadership and resources; engagement and decision making: cohesion and direction: and governance quality. Informing institutional and management design using these requirements will enable the development of regimes more suited to meeting the fundamental challenges that unanticipated, abrupt and turbulent change poses for the conservation of marine biodiversity and the resilience of associated social-ecological systems. Such a governance and management regime would be more effective in managing social-ecological resilience because it has the capacity and flexibility to deal with change, founded on learning, diversity and ethics.

Abstract: The worldwide movement toward digitisation in public service delivery presents a range of opportunities and risks. The potential benefits include improved efficiency, more consistent service delivery decisions and enhanced responsiveness to citizens' demand. The potential risks range from challenges in data use and privacy, to uneven service accessibility and the costly ICT investment required for digitisation. Researchers have begun to assess this important movement and its impacts. There remains a lack of in-depth understanding of digitisation of public service delivery in developing countries. We aim to address that gap by examining a fully online welfare-to-work programme in a developing country, that is Indonesia's Pre-employment Card Program. Using data collected from semi-structured interviews with policymakers and service providers, we found evidence that digitalisation contributed to the programme's efficiency and effectiveness via, for example, automated registration processes and quick and revisable rollout. Its implementation however was not without challenges such as a digital divide among users and some technical problems. Indonesia's experiences with this fully digital programme suggest that a developing country, despite limited financial and administrative capacity, can embark on the digitalisation journey to improve their public service provision, even during the time of crisis.

Abstract: This study examines how politician's career concerns affect the bank loans using a sample of bank branches at the county-level in China. We use politician tenure to measure an important dimension of the politician incentives to intervene in the local economy, which is determined by their career concerns about perceived promotion probability. We find that there is a curvilinear relationship between politician tenure and bank loans (i.e., reversed U-shape). We also construct a promotion pressure index and document a positive relationship between this promotion index and bank loans. These results are more significant for banks located in counties with underdeveloped institutions or weak government capacity, and those with political ties. These results support the view that politicians have strong incentives to utilize local banks to promote local economic growth if it is also consistent with their private goals, especially in the environment with significant government ownership in banking systems.

Abstract: Drawing upon recent fieldwork, we examine the paradoxical effects of the institutional transfer and capacity-building approach adopted by the ongoing regional intervention in post-conflict Solomon Islands. Taking the mission's substantial police-building component as our focus, we argue that this engagement has done little to extend the functional authority of the local police in rural Solomon Islands and has, moreover, induced unsustainable levels of dependency on external assistance. We also argue that this engagement has inadvertently reinforced lack of public confidence in the local police, thereby undermining its legitimacy. The privileging of institutional capacity building and failure to engage with community-based providers of policing and justice services in rural localities has resulted in the neglect of critical issues of legitimacy and the extension of administrative power which are integral to the larger state-building process. In considering how these shortcomings might be addressed, we explore contemporary nostalgia for older administrative systems that appeared capable of sustaining vertical linkages between central government and the rural periphery, as well as horizontal linkages between state and local legal orders. We sketch the diverse configurations of current policing and justice practices in rural areas and the strong desire for greater engagement between the different orders and providers. Through reference to a nascent community policing project, we canvas some alternative imaginings of how Solomon Islands institutions might be transformed to produce more effective and sustainable policing and justice outcomes for rural-based citizens and that can simultaneously advance the larger state-building agenda.

Abstract: We examine the governance transfer effect of corporate blockholders in a sample of 892 block acquisitions across 42 countries from 1990 to 2008. Using earnings management as a proxy for corporate governance outcome, we find that target firms' earnings management is aligned with that of block acquirers after acquisitions, implying that blockholders transfer their own governance quality to investee firms. We further identify three economic mechanisms that underlie the governance transfer effect, namely, monitoring effectiveness, monitoring cost, and monitoring environment. Our findings provide new insights into the governance role of blockholders. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to an emerging body of critique of communicative planning theory (CPT). The critiques in the paper are grounded in analysis of situated planning practice in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, where planners were 'feeling their way towards' democratising planning practice in line with the normative dimensions of CPT. Two critiques are offered. Both are fundamentally concerned with power and the tendency of CPT to operate as if the workings of power can be temporarily suspended through communicative planning practice to produce new consensual planning discourses. First, it is argued that CPT pays insufficient attention to the practical context of power in which planning is practised, thereby assuming away, rather than engaging with, the politics-laden and power-laden interests that infiltrate planning practice. Second, it is argued that CPT abstracts planners from their positioning in a nexus of power, knowledge, and rationality which validates expert forms of knowing/reasoning/valuing, and thus underestimates the challenges of asserting alternative forms. The paper concludes with a suggestion that any theory aiming at the democratisation of planning practice will need to depart from an orientation to consensus, a defining feature of CPT, and instead account for the irreducible nature of power and difference.

Abstract: Indigenous Australians have a growing capacity to extract monetary payments from mineral development on their traditional lands. Considerable controversy surrounds the possible use of these payments to fund services such as health, housing and education for the Indigenous groups concerned. Critics of such an approach argue that government should provide basic public services to all citizens, and that use of 'mining payments' for service provision denies Indigenous people specific compensation for the negative impacts of mining and an important opportunity to enhance their economic status. There is also a danger that government may reduce its existing spending on services, leaving Indigenous people no better off as a result of allowing mining to occur. This article argues that while there are certainly risks involved in using mining payments to fund services, Indigenous groups can generate substantial net benefits by doing so. Mining payments can leverage additional government spending; fund services at a level or of a sort that government will not provide; give Indigenous people greater control over service provision; and help develop Indigenous organisational skills and governance capacity. A strategic approach is required to minimise risk and maximise the available benefits, and the article identifies policy principles that can be applied to secure such an outcome.

Abstract: Asia-Pacific countries are experiencing rapid economic growth. Is this growth ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors-based and aligned growth? Therefore, this study investigates the connections between ESG indicators and economic growth in East Asia Pacific and South Asia. To achieve this aim, we employed the FMOLS, DOLS, and AMG models. While the AMG model highlights significant long-term positive effects of the environmental (EFs) and governance factors (GOVNF) on economic growth, the FMOLS and DOLS models emphasize the substantial influence of social factors (SOC) on economic growth. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of ESG factors and offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align strategies with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Notably, the GOVNF, with components like control of corruption, regulatory quality, rule of law, and government effectiveness, does not influence the GDP of developed nations, such as Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. However, its significance is evident in countries like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. This result might stem from the possibility that developed countries have historically addressed and resolved issues like corruption and the rule of law, while these elements remain crucial determinants for the economic growth of developing nations like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Empirical findings provide the region's policymakers with essential insights and a guide for implementing their economic growth policies ESG factor-based and aligned to the United Nations' SDGs. These targets will make the economic growth of the region's countries sustainable.

Abstract: Temporary migrant workers in Southeast Asia are subject to various abuses in recruitment, work and repatriation. A decade ago ASEAN governments committed to developing an Instrument governing migrant worker rights, but a series of deadlocks have stymied this agreement. Prevailing accounts explain this impasse as the consequence of incompatible national interests, norms of non-interference and consensus, a lack of institutional capacity and the limits of rights advocacy in ASEAN. Conversely, utilising a political economy framework, this article demonstrates this impasse in regional governance reflects societal-level conflicts among migrant workers, civil society organisations, business groups and state-based actors, generated by the latter's adoption of migrant labour as both a livelihood and development strategy.

Abstract: Sea level rise poses severe consequences for the economic stability, habitability, and existence of Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Recent legal developments have offered conflicting interpretations of the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention, but under the existing framework, Pacific SIDS are at the precipice of losing substantial territorial sovereignty and maritime entitlements. These losses have unprecedented and cascading impacts across sovereignty, governance capacity, and migration. To mitigate immediate impacts of sea level rise, strategies of physical adaptation, planned relocation, and a new rule of customary law are recommended for Pacific SIDS. Revisiting regimes crafted during periods of ecological stability will also be critical to effectively integrate climate change law with international systems. Broadly, there is an urgent need to address the growing impact of sea level rise on legal obligations under international law.

Abstract: Background: Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing is a problem for marine resource managers, leading to depletion of fish stocks and negative impacts on marine ecosystems. These problems are particularly evident in regions with weak governance. Countries responsible for sustainable natural resource management in the Southern Ocean have actively worked to reduce IUU fishing in the region over a period of 15 years, leading to a sequence of three distinct peaks of IUU fishing. Methodology/Principal Findings: We reviewed existing public records relating to IUU fishing in the Southern Ocean between 1995-2009 and related this information to the governance capacity of flag states responsible for IUU vessels. IUU operators used a number of methods to adapt to enforcement actions, resulting in reduced risks of detection, apprehension and sanctioning. They changed fishing locations, vessel names and flag states, and ports for offloading IUU catches. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of IUU vessels flagged to CCAMLR countries, and a significant decrease in the average governance index of flag states. Despite a decreasing trend of IUU fishing, further actions are hampered by the regional scope of CCAMLR and the governance capacity of responsible states. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study of long-term change in the modus operandi of IUU fishing fishing operators, illustrating that IUU operators can adapt to enforcement actions and that such dynamics may lead to new problems elsewhere, where countries have a limited capacity. This outsourcing of problems may have similarities to natural resource extraction in other sectors and in other regions. IUU fishing is the result of a number of factors, and effectively addressing this major challenge to sustainable marine resource extraction will likely require a stronger focus on governance. Highly mobile resource extractors with substantial funds are able to adapt to changing regulations by exploiting countries and regions with limited capacity.

Abstract: The challenges of COVID-19 have particularly invited closer attention to localised impacts and the extent that intergovernmental coordination, policy capacity, and local autonomy are implicated in the effectiveness of government responses to the pandemic. Drawing on our case study of the implementation of social safety nets in Jakarta, we explore the tensions between national-local government arising from decentralisation unfold as disjunctures between mode of governance and institutional capacity. We argue that the human factor, individuals negotiating and navigating complex and problematic systems and processes, points to human agency being central for success in the implementation, execution, and delivery of services.

Abstract: Local governments have a vital climate change adaptation role. However, major breakdowns in the ability of local governments to mainstream adaptation responses have been widely observed. Using a Systematic Quantitative Literature Review method, we assessed 131 original research articles published 2005-2020 to answer three key questions: What trends are evident in the global literature that explain adaptation mainstreaming efforts in municipal policy and practice? What factors are conceptualized as shaping adaptation mainstreaming in local government? Which elements can be considered key to advancing adaptation mainstreaming in municipal policy and practice?We find two overarching factors affect outcomes - authority to adapt and capacity to adapt. Authority to adapt refers to the authorizing environment - or mandate - from national or sub-national government, or from local government leaders, for adaptation action by a municipal administration. Capacity to adapt refers to access to resources, professional networks, and supportive organizational systems and culture, that enable local government adaptation. We find lack of support from local government elected leaders is the most frequently identified barrier to municipal adaptation. Yet, few empirical studies offer deep insight into the factors that inform and influence leadership support for municipal adaptation. Further, we find local government capacity to adapt is largely treated as a singular capacity, held constant throughout the policy cycle. We find limited exploration of the capacities vital to each stage of the policy cycle and the configuration of factors that support adaptation outcomes. We devise a conceptual framework explaining how issues of authority and capacity can interact and influence each other and what they encompass. Such a framework has broader utility for policy development and importantly for implementation at the local level.Key policy insightsMunicipal adaptation can be strengthened through expanded understanding of, and attention to, the factors that inform local leaders' decisions on adaptation, notably clustered around authority and capacity to adapt.Policymakers are encouraged to actively consider the differing capacities needed to progress adaptation through each stage of the policy cycle.Using an implementation lens to evaluate adaptation practice could support documentation of planning-to-implementation gaps and ways of bridging these gaps for enhanced municipal adaptation outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate whether development aid stimulates growth in transition economies, paying particular attention to the possibility of spatial spillovers arising from aid. We find that common borders and a shared historical and political heritage result in a complex set of associations between aid and growth. Aid has a positive impact on growth in the recipient country. However, the impact of aid also spills over to affect other nations. Aid appears to create positive spillovers through improved total factor productivity and possibly currency appreciation. At the same time, aid depletes human capital through emigration and it particularly adversely affects democracy and governance quality in other transition economies. On balance, aid generates net adverse growth spillovers in transition economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In a world of open-ended access to social media, the ability of governments to control information is slipping away. It is plausible in countries with limited Internet access for citizens to remain ignorant of the true amount of corruption. We built a cross-country panel of 124 developing nations to analyze the effect of Internet usage on perceptions of corruption from 1996 to 2009. We find that, ceteris paribus, the information citizens receive from the World Wide Web leads to deteriorating views of the state of corruption in their country. Greater perceptions of government effectiveness are unsurprisingly found to negatively and significantly decrease perceptions of corruption within countries.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether or not private benefits of control by managers and large shareholders influence the financing cost of firms. Evidence shows that lending banks demand a significantly higher loan spread, higher fees, shorter loan maturity, smaller loan size, stricter covenants, and greater collateral on firms with greater private benefits of control. Results are stronger for firms with weak corporate governance quality, supporting the agency cost viewpoint. Such evidence implies that banks consider higher private benefits of control as a type of agency problem when they make lending decisions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Scholars recommend country (or region) specific energy security indices capable of adequately considering local specificities in the absence of a 'universal' index. Such an index is not available for Nepal. Hence, this study is the first to develop the Energy Security Composite Index of Nepal (ESCOIN), applying a comprehensive indicator-based approach to quantify energy security (ES) of Nepal. We build upon the notion that a country is able to trade energy when it is energy secure. We quantify Nepal's energy security and qualitatively assess the prospect for regional power trade in South Asia. A long list of 77 indicators is compiled from an extensive review of international literature. Based on the context, applicability to Nepal, data availability and conditions of multicollinearity, this list of indicators is narrowed down to 21. Principal Component Analysis is then applied to evaluate the importance of the components for ESCOIN. Our results show that Nepal has consistently held a boundary position between "moderate" to "high" classes of ES in the last decade. We identify key reasons for this. First, the country's domestic sector is over-reliant on traditional fuels (dry-dung, firewood and agricultural residues). Second, Nepal faces a problem of suppressed demand in the absence of energy-intensive development activities in all productive sectors of the economy. Third, the growth in the energy demand is met only marginally by domestic hydropower and other renewables, and largely by increasing imports. Hence, we surmise a 'pseudo energy secure' state for Nepal. Although efforts are underway, electricity trade with China, Bangladesh and other South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries is economically difficult and technically challenging. Hence, cross-border electricity trading, particularly with India, can be seen as an opportunity for Nepal provided considerable infrastructural development occurs, institutional capacity is strengthened, and genuine political commitment and trust are sustained. Moreover, Nepal should focus on achieving self-sufficiency in energy through domestic hydropower and renewable sources and aim to stabilize energy consumption rather than being overly ambitious of exports, at least in the near future.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Coping with Multiple Stresses in Rural South Africa

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to investigate how local communities cope with and adapt to multiple stresses in rural semiarid South Africa. In semiarid regions water scarcity is one of a number of stresses that shape livelihood vulnerability. With climate change, it is predicted that rainfall in South Africa will become more uncertain and variable in the future, exposing more people to water insecurity. At the same time, the impacts of disease, a lack of institutional capacity, and limited livelihood opportunities can combine to limit adaptive capacity. Therefore, adaptation to changing climate should not be viewed in isolation but instead in the context of social, economic, and political conditions, all of which shape local community vulnerability and people's ability to cope with and adapt to change. This study uses a qualitative-quantitative-qualitative framework, including the use of a stated preference survey, to identify the drivers of agroecosystem change, to understand the capacity of households to cope with droughts, and to determine the ability of local institutions to respond to crises. The analysis suggests that the capacity of the agroecosystem to remain productive during droughts is decreasing, individual/household adaptive capacity remains low, and institutional capacity faces considerable barriers that prevent it from supporting households to adapt to multiple stresses. This research adds weight to the claim that vulnerability reflects multiple forces and processes, and that multiple stresses, that are agroecological, socioeconomic, and institutional in nature, need to be examined to understand vulnerability and to prevent maladaptation.

Abstract: We examine whether outside investors mimic insider trades by analyzing the daily transactions of foreign institutional investors (FII) in the Indian emerging market. We find that the value relevance of insiders' opportunistic buy trades is much higher in our context relative to that reported for developed markets. More importantly, we find that FII mimic opportunistic buy trades, which is more pronounced for firms that are informationally more opaque or have lower corporate governance quality. A long-short strategy based on FII's transactions after opportunistic trades generates an additional abnormal return of approximately 29% annually, compared to transactions based on routines trades.

Abstract: The premise of this article is that when comparing governance systems, a greater focus on the complexity of the environment facing nation states would provide a step forward. National regimes should not be compared in a vacuum but rather with respect to the governance challenges they are likely to face in an unpredictable world. It is necessary to recognize the adaptive complexity of the systems generating those challenges and yet how they also providing the ingredients for emergent solutions. It is argued that exploring interactive capacity rather than formal structures will provide a stronger indication of whether governance challenges are likely to be met. It is concluded that different types of national regimes could, in principle, deliver effective interactive governance capacity in different ways, but each can generate tipping points that could lead to failure.

Abstract: The Asia-Pacific region is recognised as an epicentre of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), of which 75% are zoonotic in nature. Vietnam is recognised as a potential hotspot for zoonotic EIDs. There is a growing recognition that progress towards global health security requires greater focus on collaboration between the human health and animal health sectors to control diseases at their animal source and prevent against human health impacts. Assessment of veterinary epidemiology capacity in Vietnam is paramount to strengthening the health security of Asia-Pacific. This study aims to evaluate the national capacity and needs of veterinary services in Vietnam in biosecurity, biosafety and One Health. A cross-sectional, convergent mixed-methods study was conducted between November 2020 and April 2021. An online questionnaire was administered to government-employed field veterinarians. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were performed using survey responses to understand capacity in the field. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with stakeholders in veterinary services including government, academia, research institutes, non-profit and international organisations. Coding and thematic analysis using a deductive approach was used for data collected from interviews to contextualise findings from the survey and understand institutional capacity. In total, 178 field veterinarians completed the online survey and 25 stakeholders were interviewed. The majority of participants had reported receiving training in biosecurity and biosafety, including use of personal protective equipment. Most respondents reported practicing good biosecurity measures (92%) and good biosafety measures (88%). Physical and socioeconomic barriers to practicing biosecurity were reported to be prevalent for smallholder farmers, which may suggest a gap in the capacity of veterinary services to provide cost-effective and practical biosecurity strategies. Seventy five percent of participants had never or rarely participated in One Health approaches in the field in the last 12 months and 69% reported further training as a high priority. There was a knowledge gap reported amongst district and commune-level veterinary staff about the need for, and awareness of multisectoral collaboration. Respondents that completed postgraduate qualifications in epidemiology or Field Epidemiology Training Programs (adjusted OR: 3.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 9.23, p = 0.046) and had longer job tenure between 10-12 years (OR: 10.38; 95% CI: 3.06, 35.15, p = <0.001) were more likely to have higher levels of experience in One Health. This study identified gaps in knowledge, attitudes and adoption of practices related to biosecurity, biosafety and One Health specifically in lower-level or less experienced veterinary staff without further training opportunities in epidemiology. These findings enable prioritisation of training, policy, and planning activities to further enhance the national capacity of veterinary services in Vietnam.

Abstract: Much has been written on the 2on intervention in Libya and its implications to the R2P principle, but we know less about the lived experience of protection in a context where the post-intervention responsibility for protecting civilians was quickly transferred to the interim authorities who had limited governance capacity. This has resulted in localised protection' where militias, tribal elders, and family members constitute the main actors providing protection to their respective communities. Although this is in line with the growing emphasis on local ownership underwriting UN and donor discourse, a troubling upshot of the localised protection is that it often disempowers, and at times subjects the protected to further insecurity and violence. The aim of this analysis is to explore this dynamic of protection and insecurity. I draw on feminist theorising of the masculine protection logic and argue that civilians in Libya negotiate multiple, gendered protection bargains that often produce perverse outcomes, by subjecting the `protected' to renewed or increased insecurities, rather than reducing them.

Abstract: This paper investigates the determinants of COVID-19 infection in the first 100 days of government actions. Using a debiased LASSO estimator, we explore how different measures of government nonpharmaceutical interventions affect new infections of COVID-19 for 37 lower and middle-income countries (LMCs). We find that closing schools, stay-at-home restrictions, and contact tracing reduce the growth of new infections, as do economic support to households and the number of health care workers. Notably, we find no significant effects of business closures. Finally, infections become higher in countries with greater income inequality, higher tourist inflows, poorly educated adults, and weak governance quality. We conclude that several policy interventions reduce infection rates for poorer countries. Further, economic and institutional factors are important; thereby justifying the use, and ultimately success, of economic support to households during the initial infection period.

Several strategies, in addition to security measures, are shown to significantly reduce the probability of politicians being attacked or killed: extended institutional and governance quality, democracy, voice and accountability, a well-functioning system of law and order, decentralization via the division of power and federalism, larger cabinet size and a stronger civil society. There is also support for a contagion effect.

Abstract: It has been well documented that cross-listing can improve firms' governance quality and reduce equity financing costs, which are crucial for firms' innovation activities. In this paper, we investigate the effect of cross-listing on the Hong Kong (HK) market on the innovation performance of Chinese mainland firms. We find that both innovation outputs and qualities increase significantly when Chinese mainland firms list their shares on the HK market. Concerning the channels through which cross-listing encourages innovation, we demonstrate that cross-listed firms can raise low-cost funds in the HK market, which facilitates their innovation activities. Moreover, the HK market generates more informative stock prices, which mitigate innovation information asymmetry and also encourage firms' innovation. In general, our paper sheds light on a new factor (cross-listing) that motivates firms to engage in innovation and highlights cross-listing's function in improving innovation.

Abstract: We show a link between levels of mass education in 1870 and corruption levels in 2010 for seventy-eight countries that remains strong when controlling for change in the level of education, GDP/capita, and democracy. A model for the causal mechanism between universal education and control of corruption is presented. Early introduction of universal education is linked to levels of economic equality and to efforts to increase state capacity. First, societies with more equal education gave citizens more opportunities and power for opposing corruption. Secondly, the need for increased state capacity was a strong motivation for the introduction of universal education in many countries. Strong states provided more education to their publics and such states were more common where economic disparities were initially smaller.

We assess three dimensions of institutional quality: economic freedom, democracy, and good governance. We also consider the impact of cultural differences. Possibly surprisingly, wetland values are lower in more market based economies and they are lower in cultures that are more indulgent and authoritarian. In contrast, improved government effectiveness increases wetland valuations. Understanding these important and varying effects of institutions and culture on wetland valuations is important for policy development and environmental preservation.

Abstract: The adoption of weak remedies, such as declarations or recommendations by the Bangladesh Supreme Court in litigations on state-induced forced slum evictions, significantly contributes to the tardy implementation of court orders. In this context, there is a growing global consensus on the structural injunction-a remedy that enables judges to monitor and bring about governmental compliance with judicial orders of social rights litigation. The Bangladesh Supreme Court faces several real and compelling challenges relating to its constitutional authority and institutional capacity that hinder remedial innovation. Through examining relevant constitutional provisions, judicial approach, and comparative examples, this article argues that the court has the capacity to overcome these constraints. Thus, it advocates judicial reform in Bangladesh to offset the state's often arbitrary interference with the basic necessity of housing of the slum dwellers.

Abstract: Workable financial mechanisms are essential to abate greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, which contributes a large proportion of total global emissions, must be avoided as an effective emissions-reduction tactic, and to alleviate biodiversity loss and poverty. However, incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) have had mixed and suboptimal success because of opportunity costs and administrative and technical issues, in particular, leakage, permanence, and additionality. We show that these latter concepts can be ambiguous, potentially contrived and in some cases, generate perverse outcomes. Encumbering avoided-deforestation projects with these administrative shackles risks massive increases in global deforestation and a concomitant loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services and emissions-reduction opportunities. We offer a solution built on a proven insurance-based hedging principle, a concept we call iREDD, that could indirectly address specific technical and administrative challenges, whether real or contrived. Project-specific iREDD insurance policies and premiums would be negotiated upfront using a simple assessment of risk based on governance quality, the integrity of management plans, liquidity, monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and political acceptability. iREDD acts as both an incentive for prudent forest management given the seller's potential financial windfall if forests are diligently managed, and guarantees not to disenfranchise the buyer.

Abstract: Our working hypothesis is that cross-cultural differences in tax compliance behavior have foundations in the institutions of tax administration and citizen assessment of the quality of governance. Tax compliance being a complex behavioral issue, its investigation requires use of a variety of methods and data sources. Results from artefactual field experiments conducted in countries with substantially different political histories and records of governance quality demonstrate that observed differences in tax compliance levels persist over alternative levels of enforcement. The experimental results are shown to be robust by replicating them for the same countries using survey response measures of tax compliance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In recent years, significant work has emerged exploring the relationship between tourism and mining. Generally, the relationship is considered to be negative, the result of crowding out of tourism during mining booms. However, the relationship is likely to be more complicated with mining affecting tourism both directly and indirectly. The indirect effects arise from the mediation role played by foreign direct investment (FDI), governance quality, trade and the real exchange rate. To verify this hypothesis, this article uses an unbalanced panel data set that covers 190 countries over the 2002-2017 period. A structural equation model is used to account for the mediating relationships. The results show a direct negative relationship between natural resource intensity and international tourist arrivals, as well as indirect positive relationship mediated by FDI partially offset by an indirect negative relationship mediated by governance.

Abstract: Water plays an important role in underpinning equitable, stable and productive societies and ecosystems. Hence, United Nations recognized ensuring water security as one (Goal 6) of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs). Many international river basins are likely to experience 'low water security' over the coming decades. Water security is rooted not only in the physical availability of freshwater resources relative to water demand, but also on social and economic factors (e.g. sound water planning and management approaches, institutional capacity to provide water services, sustainable economic policies). Until recently, advanced tools and methods are available for the assessment of water scarcity. However, quantitative and integrated-physical and socio-economic-approaches for spatial analysis of water security at global level are not available yet. In this study, we present a spatial multi-criteria analysis framework to provide a global assessment of water security. The selected indicators are based on Goal 6 of SDGs. The term 'security' is conceptualized as a function of 'availability', 'accessibility to services', 'safety and quality', and 'management'. The proposed global water security index (GWSI) is calculated by aggregating indicator values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using the ordered weighted average method, which allows for the exploration of the sensitivity of final maps to different attitudes of hypothetical policy makers. Our assessment suggests that countries of Africa, South Asia and Middle East experience very low water security. Other areas of high water scarcity, such as some parts of United States, Australia and Southern Europe, show better GWSI values, due to good performance of management, safety and quality, and accessibility.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between corporate carbon performance (CCP) and corporate cost of debt (COD) in Asia-Pacific countries. Using a sample of 3666 firm-year observations from 14 countries over the period 2003-2018, COD is found to be lower when a firm has higher carbon performance (CCP). We also find that CCP produces greater reductions in COD for firms in countries with weak governance quality. Thus, a country-level governance mechanism and debt markets are substitutes in addressing corporate carbon performance (CCP). The main results are robust after controlling for sample selection bias and endogeneity problems using alternative model specifications. The results are also robust after controlling for heterogeneity problems using sub-samples, accounting for the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), using an alternative COD measure, and controlling for potential simultaneous causality and for corporate governance variables.

Abstract: The lowland floodplains of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) experience prolonged dry seasons characterized by pronounced and common water scarcity, with water supplies increasingly offset with groundwater. Groundwater assessment is still at a very rudimentary stage in Laos, making it difficult to ensure that new water supplies are developed successfully and managed sustainably. The goal of this study is to apply a variety of field hydrogeophysical techniques to this problem and in the process help build and strengthen human and institutional capacity with various stakeholder groups from the government, the university, and the community. The study area focuses on a cross section of the Vientiane Plain (VP) in the Lower Mekong Basin in central Lao PDR to identify and characterize the hydrogeology and groundwater quality. The research collaboration has built and strengthened stakeholder capacity by developing and progressing the hydrogeologic field mapping of the VP. It has provided local undergraduate and postgraduate training opportunities using several different near-surface geophysical and hydrogeologic techniques, some previously untested in Lao PDR. At one of the survey sites, the geophysics has indicated the spatial extent of the shallow aquifer and in the process identified an extensive conductive zone, interpreted as more saline groundwater. Any groundwater development within this or similar zones is likely to be unsuitable as sources for drinking and irrigation water. Engagement with the local village authorities has supported local community members and government to expand groundwater development for rural water supplies. Access to groundwater as a reliable, safe, and secure resource provides an opportunity for strengthening the resilience of farmers to changing climatic conditions. Participatory research collaboration of this kind can positively enhance data and build capacity, which is a required precursor for improving knowledge and management of poorly understood groundwater resources.

Abstract: Objectives We quantified the contents of existing public health competency frameworks against the elements of the World Federation of Public Health Associations' Global Charter for the Public's Health. Methods We conducted a desktop analysis of eight public health competency frameworks publicly available on the internet. Using a pre-formed template, competency statements from each framework were mapped against the elements of the Global Charter-core public health services (Protection, Promotion and Prevention) and overarching enabling functions (Information, Governance, Capacity, and Advocacy). We then quantified coverage of the Charter's elements in each of the frameworks. Results We found that although the public health competency frameworks vary considerably in terms of coverage and focus, they all cover every element contained in the Global Charter. However, there were a number of areas of competency identified in some frameworks not explicitly referred to in the Charter including cultural safety, human rights and systems thinking. Conclusions The Global Charter provides a mechanism for comparing competency sets, checking public health curricula content, informing competency framework and curricula (re)design, and planning and monitoring workforce needs.

Abstract: Very few empirical studies have investigated programmes in which doctoral students act as peer facilitators in faculty writing groups. We report on the development of a centrally delivered doctoral student writing programme in which twenty student participants were mentored and provided with the resources to initiate their own faculty-based doctoral writing groups. Legitimate peripheral participation' was used as a conceptual lens to interpret the data collected during the establishment and evaluation of the programme. All student participants in the preparatory training course, which was developed in consultation with postgraduate students and research supervisors, went on to become doctoral writing peer facilitators of peer writing groups. Insights from seven of these showed how a well-structured and supportive programme harnessed the benefits of peer learning by bringing personal rewards to participants and building institutional capacity around doctoral research writing literacies.

Abstract: Community engagement and local governance are important components of health interventions aiming to empower local populations. Yet, there is limited evidence on how to effectively engage with communities and codevelop interventions, especially in Southeast Asian contexts. Despite rapid progress, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) still has high maternal and child mortality, with essential service coverage showing significant disparities across socioeconomic strata. Long-standing challenges in community health were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by poor trust between users and health providers. However, the pandemic also provided an opportunity to develop approaches for enhanced community engagement and local governance capacity to tackle health inequities. The Community Network Engagement for Essential Healthcare and COVID-19 Responses through Trust (CONNECT) Initiative, developed by the Lao PDR government, WHO and partners, has resulted in initial positive outcomes in community health such as increased vaccination uptake, facility births and trust in health providers. This case study describes the iterative, adaptive process by which the CONNECT Initiative was developed, and how the core components, key stakeholders, theory of change and evaluation framework evolved from grounded observations and hypotheses. Lessons learnt include (1) awareness of entry points and existing structures to strengthen local governance for health through mutually beneficial intersectoral collaboration; (2) building relationships and trust with an adaptive, grounds-up approach for sustainability and scalability. As a model which can be adapted to other settings, this case study provides evidence on how to engage with communities, strengthen local governance and codevelop interventions towards greater health equity.

Abstract: The state of governance in Bangladesh has a chequered history. The country's battle for independence, and its history of military dictatorships and dysfunctional democracy, have brought challenges in terms of establishing a sound system of governance. The five pillars of public governance have posed formidable obstacles to establishing and reforming key institutions, refining processes and strategies of management and guiding the country towards a more efficient and effective system. Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative accountability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, administrative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains. We argue that state institutions have been captured by members of a powerful nexus who have developed a symbiotic relationship with the state, affecting its institutional capacity to reduce corruption, strengthen transparency and accountability, and allow the judiciary and public bureaucracy to work professionally.

Abstract: Mining investment in Indonesia has been at a standstill for a decade. Clearly, international mining companies regard the country as a high risk destination for capital. Yet Indonesia is one of the most highly mineralised countries in the world and has expressed a desire to increase investment in the sector in the coming years. As a first step in this direction the government has introduced a new mineral and coal mining law to replace the highly regarded Contract of Work system. The government argues that this new law will reinvigorate mining investment in the country. This paper suggests that the new mining law will do little to improve the situation. Indeed, it is unlikely that Indonesia will become a preferred destination for mining investment in the foreseeable future. Poor regulatory architecture, endemic corruption, and a lack of institutional capacity continue to be of concern to investors. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study examines the association between corporate carbon performance (CCP) and firm risk using a sample of 9,212 firm-year observations from 13 countries in the Asia-Pacific region over the period 2002 -2021. We also examine the moderating role of the quality of country-level governance in the association between CCP and firm risk. We find that CCP is negatively associated with a firm 's total, idiosyncratic and systematic risk and that country-level governance quality accentuates the negative association between CCP and firm risk. We also find that country-level business culture, emissions trading schemes, climate change performance and attention to carbon emissions accentuate the negative association between CCP and firm risk. Given the growing demands from regulatory bodies for increased transparency on carbon performance, the insights gained from our research hold significant relevance for regulators, policy makers, investors, financial analysts, scholars and businesses.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Governing Ecosystem Carbon

Abstract: Governing carbon stored in natural and human-managed ecosystems is an emerging area in global climate politics. Many developed and developing countries are devising and implementing a range of reform programs that aim to reduce emissions and increase sequestration in the land use, land use change and forestry, and agricultural sectors. In developing countries, mitigation programs and projects on the ground have accelerated under the global program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The article applies a governmentality framework to analyze these policies and programs as forms of administrative, economic, and deliberative rationalities and associated technologies. What emerges in the analysis is that governing is conducted through common technologies including policy instruments and rules, stakeholder engagement processes, and the application of the same technical monitoring and carbon accounting methodologies. In the case of REDD+, there has been strong emphasis on the introduction of market and incentive approaches, but the major reforms have focused on government regulatory programs and building technical and administrative capacity. Importantly, this is allowing national and sub-national governments to extend their authority across all aspects of the reform agenda, which poses significant challenges for reducing forest loss in developing countries.

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of foreign bank presence on the Vietnamese banking sector. Using a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2005 to 2020, this study establishes a link between the presence of foreign banks and increased competitiveness in the Vietnamese market. As more foreign banks enter the local market, domestic banks tend to experience diminished profits and take on higher levels of risk. Local banks respond by increasing the riskiness of their loan portfolios, particularly through greater corporate credit issuance. The study further reveals that these impacts vary according to domestic banks' size, ownership structure, governance quality, and income diversification. Furthermore, the modes of foreign bank penetration also exhibit differential effects. The findings maintain validity through rigorous robustness checks employing various econometric methods and alternative variables. This research carries significant implications for policymakers, commercial banks, and stakeholders in the globalising banking system.

Abstract: Drawing insights from Aaron Wildavsky's studies of the craft of policy making and from the literature on pluralization in Chinese decision making, this article examines the role played by the biggest state-owned enterprise, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), in shaping the country's electricity policy in the early twenty-first century. Specifically, it discusses how and why SGCC was able to sell its ultra-high-voltage projects as a solution to shortages of electricity. The article argues that (a) central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are not mere passive receivers of policy directives from the party-state; (b) those with long-term strategic vision, human and financial resources, and institutional capacity can shape government policies to their liking as policy advocates; and yet (c) no one, including central SOEs, monopolizes this process in any given policy area; and thus policy outcomes reflect competition among players and their constant interaction with government policy makers.

Abstract: This paper examines the impact of institutions on regional financial development using a panel data model of 11 East Asian countries during 1996-2017. It divides the institutional factors into six economic factors and six legal-political factors. The analysis demonstrates that the legal-political institutional factors have a stronger impact on financial development than the economic institutional factors in East Asia. Improvement in institutional quality such as fiscal freedom, business freedom, control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality and rule of law can promote financial development. Improvements of these institutional factors facilitate the ability of enterprises to allocate resources and improve the strength of business operations, thereby reducing transaction costs and making the financial operating environment fairer and more efficient. With the improvement of institutional factors, financial development will have more opportunities to develop better. Institutional impacts are more pronounced in the financial development in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar than in the other countries such as China, Japan, Korea and Singapore.

Abstract: Increasing demands for energy to boost the Mekong economies have attracted the keen interest of riparian countries for hydropower development. This is evidenced by extensive investment in hydropower projects across the region over the last few decades. Drawing on interviews with key stakeholders, including officials from Ministry of Energy and Mines, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, private sector actors, civil society organisations and academics, as well as secondary data from public and policy resources, this paper aims to examine how the government of Laos' (GoL) decisions in hydropower development are influenced by regional energy dynamics, and how these shape the country's future energy development. The paper argues that the GoL's decisions on hydropower development are highly dilemmatic, given the current limited institutional capacity in hydropower governance and the accelerating evolution of alternative energy in neighbouring countries. While uncertainty in power markets is recognised, this places greater pressure on new hydropower projects as to how much power could be sufficiently produced and exported. The paper calls for GoL's policy considerations on the development and planning of alternative energy to secure the sustainable and equitable use of water resources as stipulated in the 1995 Mekong Agreement.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Does who I am and what I feel determine what I see (or say)? A meta-analytic systematic review exploring the influence of real and perceived bodily state on spatial perception of the external environment

Abstract: Background: Bodily state is theorised to play a role in perceptual scaling of the environment, whereby low bodily capacity shifts visuospatial perception, with distances appearing farther and hills steeper, and the opposite seen for high bodily capacity. This may play a protective role, where perceptual scaling discourages engaging with the environment when capacity is low. Methodology: Our protocol was pre-registered via Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/6zya5/) with all amendments to the protocol tracked. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the role of bodily state/capacity on spatial perception measures of the environment. Databases (Medline, PsychINFO, Scopus, Embase, and Emcare) and grey literature were searched systematically, inclusive to 26/8/21. All studies were assessed using a customised Risk of Bias form. Standard mean differences and 95% CIs were calculated via meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 8,034 studies were identified from the systematic search. Of these, 68 experiments (3,195 participants) met eligibility and were included in the review. These were grouped into the following categories: fatigue; pain; age; embodiment; body size/body paty size; glucose levels; fitness; and interoception, and interoceptive accuracy. We found low level evidence (limited studies, high risk of bias) for the effect of bodily state on spatial perception. There was consistent evidence that both glucose manipulations and age influence spatial perception of distances and hills in a hypothesised direction (lower capacity associated with increased distance and hill steepness). Mixed evidence exists for the influence of external loads, embodiment, body/body-part size manipulations, pain, and interoceptive accuracy. Evidence for fitness and/or fatigue influencing spatial perception was conflicting; notably, methodological flaws with fitness and fatigue paradigms and heterogenous spatial perception measures may underlie null/conflicting results. Conclusion: We found limited evidence for bodily state influencing spatial perception of the environment. That all studies had high risk of bias makes conclusions about reported effects reflecting actual perceptual shifts (vs merely reflecting experimental demands or error due to inadequate study design) pre-emptive. Rigorous evaluation is needed to determine whether reported effects reflect more than bias (e.g., experimental demands, inadequate blinding). Future work using reliable measures of spatial perception, comprehensive evaluation of relevant confounders, and methodologically robust (and experimentally confirmed) bodily state experimental paradigms is warranted.

Abstract: As data proceeds through different levels of an organisation from its capture to its processing and refinement, it is reported as information relevant to a particular application. Data can be adversely influenced during this conversion process which can result in sub-optimal decisions being made. The collection and handling of information for a water authority must therefore be organised. Asset management systems generally consist of three major constituents: inventory, programmed action, and optimisation. The institutional capacity needs of water authorities in developing countries require greater emphasis on the first of these two constituents. A pragmatic and simple-to-use Integrated Water-Asset Management System (IWAMS) has been developed comprising water meter, leakage control and incident management modules. A water audit and Water balance module facilitates the determination of the levels of unaccounted for water, as well as the unit cost of leakage. Water mains rehabilitation priorities can be established through the representation of various data collected in the form of a common severity rating that aids decision making.

Abstract: Aquaculture of bivalve shellfish and seaweed represents a global opportunity to simultaneously advance coastal ecosystem recovery and provide substantive benefits to humanity. To identify marine ecoregions with the greatest potential for development of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture to meet this opportunity, we conducted a global spatial analysis using key environmental (e.g., nutrient pollution status), socioeconomic (e.g., governance quality), and human health factors (e.g., wastewater treatment prevalence). We identify a substantial opportunity for strategic sector development, with the highest opportunity marine ecoregions for shellfish aquaculture centered on Oceania, North America, and portions of Asia, and the highest opportunity for seaweed aquaculture distributed throughout Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North and South America. This study provides insights into specific areas where governments, international development organizations, and investors should prioritize new efforts to drive changes in public policy, capacity-building, and business planning to realize the ecosystem and societal benefits of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture.

The main successes of the project turned out to be unanticipated: the project offered significant insights to NUOL'S ongoing assessment of its administrative capacity to manage university-based research. The flexibility of the network approach, combined with a structure that oriented the international network toward engaging with, and responding to, needs articulated by NUOL staff, proved crucial to the project's ability to respond to changing institutional needs in NUOL. The importance of paying careful attention to how projects can be structured so that they are responsive to Southern needs has been heightened by intensified pressure in Canadian universities to generate funds, while promoting excellence in research and training takes a backseat.

Abstract: A public health crisis is a "touchstone" for testing the ability and capacity of a national health system. In the current era, public health crises are presenting new systematic and cross-border characteristics and uncertainty. The essence of a system for public health crisis governance is the rules administering the stimulus-response chain. The health system generally emphasizes joint participation and communication between different subjects, which may lead to overlap and redundancy as well as a lack of auxiliary support for major public health crisis events. In the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, we track the responses, challenges, and implications of the temporary disruption of the health system and its response to this major public health crisis. We examine local governance capacity, performance in pandemic control, and the coordinated responses to COVID-19. Accordingly, we identify the challenges to the health system, including the imbalance in attention given to medical care versus health care, insufficient grassroots public health efforts and control capacity, and untimely information disclosure. It is strongly suggested that the government improve its cognitive ability and focus more attention on building and strengthening the emergency health system.

Abstract: There is no proper mechanism for monitoring the effectiveness of indigenous legislation and evaluating its application in the day-to-day practice of the public administration and society. This paper firstly identifies and conceptualises the variables of state capacity and, secondly, provides empirical advances that analyse state capacity under each variable to demonstrate in practice how those variables influence or determine the actual enjoyment of the indigenous peoples' rights in Malaysial. For the purposes of this analysis and from the literature review (14,45), this analysis has identified the following variables: (i) accountability; (ii) legal legitimacy; (iii) political will; and (iv) capacity building and resources. This paper however will focus on the first variable: state accountability. The analysis clearly illustrates the implementation gap in the public administration. With few exceptions, state bureaucracy reacts as a state capitalist or rent-seizing state towards new legislation or policy passed in favour of indigenous peoples and, in doing so, rejects the recognition of the indigenous peoples' rights.

Abstract: Mining and other economic activities are carried out on a particular territory and, thus, affect the natural and human environment in which they operate. As a consequence and in order to avoid future and eventual socioenvironmental conflicts, it is essential to guarantee that these human activities are conducted in a manner that respects both environment and society. One of the most powerful tools to achieve this balance between human activities and sustainable development is Land -Use Planning (LUP), understood as the institution charged with organizing human activities to achieve that balance. Bearing this in mind, the present article has three objectives: a) complement the literature on LUP by explaining the interconnection between LUP and the mining concessions regime, b) identify and analyze the main problems with the procedures for granting mining concessions in Peru, and c) propose the foundations for a future integrated system of mining concessions and LUP based on common principles and participatory mechanisms to reconcile tensions between the interests and values of all stakeholders, in addition to providing alternative solutions to the current problems with the mining concessions regime. To analyze the mining concessions regime and LUP a qualitative methodology is adopted, combining documentary analysis, review of official reports, and semi -structured interviews with key actors. Taking into consideration the stated objectives, this research concludes that: a) to achieve sustainable development and prevent the future emergence of conflicts, mining concessions must be granted based on territorial planning that the State (at the national, regional and local levels) should undertake prior to and in conjunction with civil society; b) the mining concession procedure lacks mechanisms of good governance, environmental sustainability and social justice; and c) as an alternative solution to these issues, this research suggests the creation of an integrated system of LUP and mining concessions, one that is binding, efficient, gradual, investor -friendly and intercultural.

Abstract: Since there is a general perception that the defence industry is more susceptible to corruption compared to other sectors, using a unique database provided by Transparency International (TI), we examine the role of firm level antecedents on firm level corruption risk in the defence industry. We find that larger firms have lower levels of firm level corruption risk. Managerial shareholding is associated with higher levels of corruption risk. Firms that voluntarily disclose more information regarding their corruption control systems tend to have lower levels of corruption risk. Finally, listed firms also have lower levels of firm level corruption risk. We find that the "listing effect" is stronger among firms in financially developed countries ostensibly due to the better scrutiny and monitoring by market participants. In our analysis, we control for country level variables such as a composite index of government effectiveness in controlling defence industry corruption.

Abstract: Background: Trade agreements in the 21st century have evolved to include provisions that affect domestic public policy and public health in signatory countries. There are growing calls for health professionals and public health advocates to pursue an active advisory role in trade negotiations in order to anticipate and prevent negative outcomes for health services and public health. Aim: This scoping review explored current literature to identify existing knowledge of the implications of trade agreements for the nursing workforce, nursing practice and public health using as an example the 2018 'Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership'. Design: Scoping review Data sources: Emerald Insight, Informit, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and a number of specialist Economics, International Trade and Business, and International Relations databases. Grey literature included national and international policy documents. Review method: Literature was selected according to extraction field criteria, supplemented by hand searching of relevant grey literature and snowballing references from the selected literature reference lists. Analysis was undertaken to identify key themes emerging from the literature. Review results: Six key themes relevant to nursing workforce, nursing practice or public health were 1. Lack of consultation with public health and health professionals in trade negotiations; 2. Implications of strengthened intellectual property provisions for equitable access to medicines (including biologics) and medical devices; 3. Threats to government capacity to regulate domestic policy for public health and health services through 'Investor State Dispute Settlement' provisions 4. Threats to government capacity to regulate domestic policy for public health and health services through 'Regulatory Coherence' 5. Potential limited benefits to communities and increased health inequities 6. Potential implications of increased temporary migration. Gaps were identified in the literature for implications for nursing practice and the nursing workforce from regulatory and labour provisions of trade agreements. Conclusions: The analysis of the literature reviewed is of international importance for the nursing workforce, nursing practice and public health. Policymakers must anticipate and respond to how the inclusion of labour or regulatory provisions in trade agreements will affect nursing practice and the nursing workforce, and how this may subsequently impact on the health of communities globally.

Through 56 interviews conducted with 38 informants, this study examines the actions and interactions of institutional actors at the local level to develop insights into how these actors shape the space of this segment of the labour market through, for example, the insertion into the global labour market chain, human resource sourcing, training and development. The paper concludes by arguing that the development of the international labour market for Chinese university graduates is contingent upon the agency role and attitude of key institutional actors. And its current situation indicates a fragmented and piecemeal development with limited government support, institutional capacity and individual motivation.

Abstract: Can green states exist in a non-Western context? Much research has been focused on environmental politics in advanced industrialized economies, and the associated institutions, policy, and resources available for environmental protection efforts. Outside this narrow context however, we know far less about the progress states have made in developing their national systems of environmental governance. This gap in our understanding is particularly evident when it comes to the post-Soviet context. Using a case study of Georgia, this analysis evaluates environmental governance capacity in a transition state drawing on a framework derived from the green state literature. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Georgia has faced considerable political and economic upheaval, and in the midst of it all, the country has embarked on an ambitious program of environmental reform. The findings suggest that while the basic internal foundations of a green state exist, including considerable policy and legislative development and solid environmental financing, key challenges remain. These are centered on an unstable institutional environment, and weak policy enforcement. However non-state actors such as NGOs and international organizations provide crucial support and are likely to remain essential in building and maintaining environmental capacity in the future.

Abstract: Climate change presents an enormous development challenge to urban slums or informal settlements in the developing world. While the social vulnerability of rural communities to climate change has been extensively studied in the Global South, little is known about their counterparts living in urban slums and informal settlements. Using Accra, Ghana as a case study, this paper examines the social, economic and institutional drivers of vulnerability to climate change in three slums or informal settlements. The study draws on a mixed method research project that integrates theories from social vulnerability and political ecology. Results demonstrate a low awareness about climate change with the drivers of vulnerability in slums being poor quality housing, poor infrastructure and service provision, low participation in adaptation decision-making, as well as weak institutional capacity. Our results underscore the need for genuine participatory adaptation planning which will assist in mapping the specific vulnerabilities of slums and help identify what appropriate interventions are needed to protect assets and rebuild the adaptive capacities of slum residents.

Abstract: A major challenge for tourism as a social and economic activity and as an academic study is the integration of multiple perspectives into coherent frameworks. This paper explores this challenge and argues that a social representations approach allows for the critical analysis of formal approaches to tourism planning. Special attention is given to tourism development and governance in Africa and other emerging destinations. A content/semiotic analysis was conducted to examine figures summarising tourism planning models presented in the academic and government planning literature. This revealed a dominant social representation of tourism planning in which destination residents play only a minor role and are typically excluded from tourism governance and external agents, from both the private and public sectors, and their views of tourist needs are dominant. Most planning models were narrowly focused, had limited evaluation of all tourism benefits and costs, paid little attention to non-economic factors and did not integrate into wider development processes. The paper argues that this social representation assumes the core objective of tourism planning is to enhance outcomes for tourists and tourism businesses rather than for destination residents. Measures to enhance local governance capacity are suggested, with examples from the health, education and tourism sectors.

Abstract: In the context of flood research, scholars and practitioners have recognised that Western-knowledge-driven engineering-based flood management techniques are insufficient for successful water use and management in urban design and planning practices, while ideas, practices, and knowledge from local people are essential. Traditional water knowledge (TWK) explains people's profound understanding of natural processes and the ecological dependencies of water systems and connections with their local water system and the land, beliefs, sense, and practices that are an integral part of their culture. However, the concept of traditional knowledge may differ from scientific knowledge, as it represents a different worldview perspective from a modern Westernised world. Considering Khulna City, Bangladesh, as a case, this paper investigates the salient challenges and opportunities to integrate TWK with present urban design and planning practices. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, including relevant government officials, NGO workers, researchers, urban professionals, and local elders. This study finds that TWK can contribute to urban design and planning practices by identifying helpful ecosystem services and site-specific information; by sharing strategies for surface water protection, open-space design, and rainwater harvesting; and encouraging design of spaces for psychological benefit, and ensuring sustainability and building flood resilience in an urban context. Furthermore, this research demonstrates how these elements relate to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, issues with knowledge transmission, the identification of the actual knowledge holders, poor governance, weak urban planning, minimal institutional capacity, and perceived cultural inferiority are significant challenges restricting the integration of TWK, despite its relevance to sustainability. This paper suggests that considering traditional water use and management is necessary to develop flood resilience in an urban context in a sustainable way.

Abstract: In this paper I analyze investors' reactions to changes in the expense ratios of equity mutual funds. I show that investment flows' response to fees cannot be fully explained by looking at investors' performance sensitivity. While performance sensitivity monotonically increases with past performance, price sensitivity does not: investors who buy top past performers seem to be "distracted" by the fund's previous return and pay relatively little attention to the expense ratios. Moreover price sensitivity increases with fund visibility while performance sensitivity decreases, and while looking at data from 1986 to 2006 no discernible trend can be observed in the average performance sensitivity, price sensitivity strongly increases due to the dramatic increase in the availability of mutual funds' information for retail investors. Finally I show that investment companies strategically time their repricing decisions in order to exploit time variations in price and performance sensitivities, and that fund governance quality affects the degree to which investment companies engage in this opportunistic behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the initial changes and continuing challenges that are faced by teachers and students due to the unexpected transition to online learning from the COVID-19 pandemic at Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia. For this, the authors applied a phenomenological-case-study design, collecting qualitative data from purposively selected Ph.D. students (n = 10) and teachers (n = 4), examiners (n = 2), as well as the postgraduate coordinator. The results indicate that the teachers experienced some difficulties in effectively using learning technologies. Moreover, the students were overburdened with increased accountability and excessive challenges. However, the institutional capacity to support was relatively minimal. Despite these odds, the study participants showed higher levels of willingness and completed the program successfully. The study participants reported moderate satisfaction with their personal and professional experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to remind universities and colleges about the essential skills that students need in this unpredictable world, for example, informed decision making, creative problem solving, and adaptability.

Abstract: Rhino poaching in South Africa and India's major range states have been remarkably similar over time. Organised criminal syndicates manage an illegal supply chain of rhino horns from poachers, middlemen and corrupt authorities to East Asian black-markets. In this paper, we use rhino poaching data from South Africa and India to examine the plausibility of transnational links and coordination in their supplies of rhino horns. We develop an innovative model of oligopolistic collusion in supply and find empirical evidence to support the theory, while controlling for rhino horn demand features, corruption, governance quality, and conservation policy. Furthermore, we propose an inventory management model of a criminal syndicate that controls the horn supply chain. The method retraces and forecasts black-market prices and has potential applicability in estimating supply or demand elasticities. This paper is the first to suggest an oligopolistic feature of the poaching industry. It highlights the need to reorient conservation policy to account for possible coordination of rhino horn supplies between range states.

Abstract: BackgroundPatients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are increasing worldwide. This is especially paramount in low and middle income countries in which ESRD patients are struggling to access specialist services e.g. hemodialysis (HD). Benchmarking analysis of the offered healthcare packages in several countries and comparison of the utilized alternative healthcare models for ESRD patients may be auspicious for institutional capacity-building in the existing healthcare facilities. Main aim of this study was to perform a benchmarking and evidence-informed gap analysis of the ESRD care provision in Iran and recognize the gaps that cause diversification in care quality for ESRD patients that hinder efforts for care quality improvement in the Iranian National Healthcare System.MethodsDimensions of the Australian Anglicare Southern Queensland Clinical and Care Governance Framework (ASQCGF) were utilized as corner stones of a comprehensive clinical care plan that is essential in responding to HD patients' needs in Iran. An extensive literature search was performed at the next stage to recognize the gold standard core elements. The ascertained components were assigned to the five separate dimensions of the ASQCGF and a preliminary draft (comprehensive package of care for HD patients) was prepared. A checklist was developed at a later stage which was sent to a panel of expert consisting professional healthcare providers in nephrology and hemodialysis wards for their opinions. A gap analysis was conducted to evaluate current care processes of the Iranian HD patients align with the elements of the gold standard framework.ResultsThe identified deficits were classified in five areas in accord with the elements of ASQCGF as follow: A) supply of resources, medical devices and equipment support B) recruitment and endorsement of clinics and general work force C) infection prevention and controlling procedures D) care effectiveness monitoring and quality improvement E) provision of safe environment for both HD patients and hospitals' staff.ConclusionsThe study findings revealed considerable gaps in providing quality HD services to the Iranian HD patients that herald their therapeutic unmet needs and the shift that is needed to narrow down the widening organizational failure which fuels the current disenchantment among the both healthcare providers and HD patients.

Abstract: Using publications in the Web of Science database (WoS), this study investigates the research collaboration on the top 95 most researched global river basins since 1900. The links of both the disciplines involved and the management issues studied between the biophysical, economic, societal, climatic and governance sub-systems of these river basins were examined. We found that research collaborations were dominated within the biophysical sub-system (65.3%) since the knowledge predevelopment period (1900-1983), with continuous increases (by 18.5%) during the rapid development (1984-2000) and the stabilisation (12.9% increase) (2001-2017). However, research collaborations related to the societal sub-system remained marginalised (varied at about 1%), while those related to the governance sub-system expanded in issues studied (32.8%) but were not supported by the core governance disciplines (3.4%). The key findings explained why global river basins are degraded from the perspective of knowledge development and they can assist the strategic planning and management of scientific research for improving governance capacity in modifying the relationship between human and nature on river basins in the Anthropocene. Tackling challenges in the Anthropocene requires transformation of the current pattern of knowledge development, a revolution in the governance of science.

Abstract: Community Forestry (CF) is recognized globally as a forest management regime with the potential to address deforestation and forest degradation, provide forest goods and services to local communities and contribute to climate change mitigation. Around 4% of Bhutan's forests are currently under CF management and these forests provide essential goods and services for local communities. However, the potential of CF in Bhutan to contribute to climate change mitigation is not well understood and has not been researched. In this study, we estimated the carbon stock and carbon sequestration of community forests in Bhutan by using data from the 2015 National Forest Inventory (NFI). The total biomass carbon in community forests was 130.3 Mg ha  1 (107.3-153.2) and the soil organic carbon was 52.8 Mg ha  1 (30.4-75.1). Carbon sequestration was 0.7 Mg ha  1 yr-1. Other attributes: basal area, stem density and tree height, were also determined to assess forest condition and the potential to increase carbon sequestration. The values for biomass carbon in Bhutan's community forests as well as the non-community forests (all other forests) were similar to those reported from Forest Resource Assessment and NFI for forests in Nepal and the Indian Himalayan states respectively. Disaggregation of data from 38 research studies across the Himalayan region indicated that biomass carbon in Bhutan's forests was significantly lower than that in well-stocked (nondegraded) forests in the Indian and Nepal Himalayas. It was also much lower than that in Bhutan's Forest Management Units, which were used as an indicator of the potential upper limit of biomass carbon in Bhutan's forest environment. Similarly, basal area, stem density and mean tree height were also lower in Bhutan's community forests than in well-stocked forests in other Himalayan countries. The Bhutan Government is currently exploring the potential to generate revenue from the sale of carbon sequestered in its forests. This study confirms that there is potential to increase carbon sequestration by improving management of existing forests. Currently, the 107,866 ha of community forests in Bhutan store about 19 million Mg of carbon. With improved management by Community Forest Management Groups, which have the institutional capacity to control local management outcomes, the carbon stock could likely be doubled (to 40 million Mg of carbon), thereby demonstrating the potential of Community Forestry to play an important role in climate change mitigation, while not jeopardizing the provision of day-to-day goods and services to local communities.

Abstract: I examine the impact of the transition to local democratic elections on vigilantism in Indonesia. Using an event study model, I find that the introduction of local elections led to an increase in vigilante conflict, consistent with most theory and qualitative evidence focussing on national level impacts. I determine that the effects are particularly noteworthy in long-established districts and that the impacts are positively associated with rising state-led violence in law enforcement, results that argue against the propositions that lack of state capacity leads to rising vigilantism and that vigilantism serves to substitute for the state's weak enforcement of law. Contrary to other research, I find no evidence of increased vigilantism in the run-up to direct local elections, and I establish that vigilante conflict appears to be short-lived after the initiation of local elections, a determination that helps to resolve another debate in the literature.

Abstract: There is growing concern over the conservation status of sharks and relatives exposed to fishing mortality. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999 adopted the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA), which provides nations with advice on adopting and implementing national plans. An assessment of global national and regional plans of action on sharks (NPOAs) found: most are out of date; limited use of specific, measurable and timebound objectives and activities; no outcome objectives; and few performance assessments. This makes most NPOAs inadequate for planning and assessing efficacy. Over 33% of the annual retained catch of sharks and relatives was from countries without NPOAs and less than 12% was from countries with current NPOAs. NPOAs identified fisheries management framework deficits, ecology knowledge gaps, institutional capacity and coordination shortfalls, and budget constraints as the largest obstacles to implementation and are improvement priorities. We recommend how to amend the IPOA to better support the adoption and effective design and implementation of NPOAs for evidence-informed conservation and management.

Abstract: It is widely agreed that recent decades have witnessed a power shift towards the emerging economies. Yet the magnitude of the power shift and its implications for the global economic order are much contested. For some, the diffusion of power has been changing the power relations between the global North and global South as well as within the global South. For others, the emerging economies do not pose a significant challenge to the global North's dominance in the global political economy as the latter continues to hold structural power advantages in technology, finance, and institutional capacity. This paper contributes to this debate by analysing the changing power relations in the field of development cooperation. As shown by recent work, Chinese development finance, combining a massive scale, global reach, and distinctive modalities, has reshaped the global landscape of development finance. This paper offers an interpretation of this transformation with a focus on power relations. It argues that Chinese development finance has not only decreased the ability of Western development finance institutions to influence policy agendas and preferences in the developing world, but also eroded the latter's power to shape the governance, norms, and modalities of development cooperation.

Abstract: This paper investigates remediation of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 material weaknesses (MWs). Prior research examines full remediation of all MWs or broad categories thereof. We build on these studies by investigating remediation of specific types of MW, thus measuring progress in improving controls made by companies that have not fully remediated all problems. Specifically, we investigate whether specific MW types differ in remediation likelihood and in the association of remediation with earnings quality. Results show that remediation rates of specific MW types vary, and that remediation of specific types is differentially associated with availability of company resources and corporate governance quality. We also find that remediation of some MW types is significantly associated with changes in abnormal accruals (e.g., entity-level problems in reconciliation and information technology, along with account-specific problems in revenue and tax). Finally, results show that problems remaining unremediated for two years are significantly associated with increased abnormal accruals, regardless of type.

Abstract: Within the context of ecological civilization, this study examines Pakistan's path toward green urbanization. This study's main driving force is Pakistan's rapidly urbanizing landscape, which makes it imperative to address environmental degradation and advance sustainable development. A paradigm change towards green urbanization is required because of the multiple environmental difficulties brought about by urbanization in Pakistan, such as pollution, resource depletion, and habitat loss. This study examines the current status of green urbanization in Pakistan through a thorough analysis using a mixed-methods methodology that combines quantitative data analysis with qualitative evaluations. The findings show that, although there are regional variations in the extent of implementation, there is a growing consciousness of and desire to implement eco-friendly policies and practices within urban areas. Goals for green urbanization are seriously hampered by issues including poor infrastructure, scarce resources, and institutional capacity limitations. However, there are encouraging indications of development such as programs supporting green building techniques, sustainable transportation, and renewable energy. Beyond the confines of academia, the research has implications that teach stakeholders, legislators, and urban planners about the necessity of incorporating ecological principles into urban development initiatives. Pakistan can reduce environmental risks, increase climate change resistance, and promote inclusive, sustainable cities for future generations by adopting green urbanization.

Abstract: Water trading has been proposed as an effective mechanism for delivering economic benefits within environmental limits. It represents one possibility for applying a dynamic allocation framework within which environmental river flows can be monitored and improved to support ecological, cultural, aesthetical and recreational values. Based on international experience, requirements for the successful implementation of water trading are assessed in the Aotearoa-New Zealand context. It is concluded that, if the environment is recognised as a water user, water trading has potential to promote sustainable water use but is associated with significant set-up and ongoing costs. A co-governance policy framework for water trading has not been agreed by iwi/hapu and the Crown based on Te Tiriti o Waitangi (1840). The institutional capacity required for development and implementation of trading is currently lacking, and the roles that government agencies and iwi/hapu would play are unclear. Market operational requirements relating to collection, collation and communication of hydrological data are only partially in place. Finally, New Zealand's flashy hydrology is not conducive to seasonal water trading and smaller catchments may contain insufficient users to constitute a functioning market. Water trading should therefore not be viewed as an easily implementable solution for improved freshwater management.

Abstract: An increasing number of countries are implementing strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to support the development of environmentally sustainable policies, plans and programs. However, some Global South countries are yet to legislate for SEA and research is needed to understand the contextual challenges to implementing SEA effectively in these jurisdictions. Here, we examine Mexico's first attempt at applying SEA to assess the potential impacts of urban development plans on a city-wide scale, including those on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Using stakeholder interviews and reflexive thematic analysis, we identify and discuss key factors to consider when formally implementing SEA in Mexico for it to achieve its intended objectives. We relate our findings to existing studies on SEA in Global South countries and discuss contextual challenges that may be shared by these jurisdictions, namely: limited knowledge and experience with SEA, low trust in public institutions, and limited institutional capacity of environmental agencies. We then provide recommendations for addressing these shared challenges, which may also prove useful for countries experiencing difficulties with the application of SEA.

Abstract: This paper uses systems analysis to examine the factors that influence leakage in Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) projects in tropical forest areas in developing countries. A causal loop diagram is used to identify some key intervention points for stakeholders to reduce the negative impacts of leakage. One of the most important intervention points identified is to provide livelihood alternatives to supplement the resources and the income that neighbouring small-scale landholders and communities must forego for the REDD initiative to be successful. The question remains, however, of how best to organise and distribute these resource allocations and payments to support the REDD project objectives. It is concluded that in many cases, developing countries with tropical forest coverage are unlikely to benefit from REDD in the foreseeable future, because of constraints related to economies of scale, but also because of political instability and lack of institutional capacity in many of these nations. Moreover, the risk remains that many of these developing countries will suffer from cross-border market leakage due to REDD projects conducted elsewhere, and that this will lead to negative local forest conservation and livelihood outcomes.

Abstract: We employ an extended Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model combined with the environmental Kuznets curve and machine learning algorithms, including ridge and lasso regression, to investigate the impact of institutions on carbon emissions in a sample of 22 European Union countries over 2002 to 2020. Splitting the sample into two: those with weak and strong institutions, we find that the results differ between the two groups. Our results suggest that changes in institutional quality have a limited impact on carbon emissions. Government effectiveness leads to an increase in emissions in the European Union countries with stronger institutions, whereas voice and accountability lead to a fall in emissions. In the group with weaker institutions, political stability and the control of corruption reduce carbon emissions. Our findings indicate that variables such as population density, urbanization and energy consumption are more important determinants of carbon emissions in the European Union compared to institutional governance. The results suggest the need for coordinated and consistent policies that are aligned with climate targets for the European Union as a whole.

Abstract: During recent decades capitalist forces have altered the geography of economic production and intensified the de-industrialisation of old industrial regions (OIRs). Various regional development prescriptions have followed including place-based concepts centred upon the stronger involvement of local and regional actors. Yet in promoting a shift beyond overly centralist responses, important questions remain about local institutional capacity, especially within OIRs given frequent attention to institutional paralysis and fragmentation. Although more fruitful evolutionary perspectives can be identified, ground level outcomes remain uncertain. This paper focuses on the Black Country OIRs within the English West Midlands where a transformational vision resulted from sub-regional joint working during the 2000s. Whilst acknowledging important external drivers, not least state support for new spaces of governance, a constructivist perspective is presented to more fully understand why a transformative collaborative approach emerged. Particular attention is given to the role of Black Country advocates in creating dilemmas, questioning traditions and challenging existing beliefs. Place-based development approaches therefore do emerge in a latent sense but must be actively constructed. Even then, substantial limitations exist stemming from continuing institutional influences.

Abstract: More than two decades have passed since the start of the worldwide market-oriented electricity sector reforms. The reforms have varied in terms of structure, market mechanisms, and regulation. However, the passage of time calls for taking stock of the performance of the reforms in developing countries. This paper surveys the empirical literature on electricity sector reforms and draws some conclusions with a view to the future. Overall, the reforms have tended to improve the technical efficiency of the sector. The macroeconomic benefits of reforms are less clear and remain difficult to identify. Also, the gains from the reforms have often not trickled down to consumers because of institutional and regulatory weaknesses. In order to achieve lasting benefits, reforms need to adopt measures that align their pursuit of economic efficiency with those of equity and provision of access. Reforms can deliver more economic benefits and alleviate poverty when the poor have access to electricity. New technologies and institutional capacity building can help improve the performance of reforms.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has swept the world, leaving behind a trail of free-falling economy, misery and death. The most vulnerable are the hardest hit-the elderly, those with chronic noncommunicable diseases and the poor and marginalised in society. The experience of various countries in handling the pandemic has shown that robustness of health system with surge capacity is critical to take the pandemic head-on. In the process important lessons for health systems have emerged. Countries with political leaders who led with a principled approach, while adopting an early and comprehensive strategy to contain the virus, have done better. Vulnerable populations should not be left to be further marginalised. To deal with the 'infodemic', communities should be engaged early. For successful handling of future challenges investment in public health is a must. National readiness and response capacity for epidemic control and disease surveillance need to be strengthened, leveraging modern technology. Institutional capacity building, pooling resources and harnessing innovations through partnerships would be key for mounting effective response now and in the future.

A key way that missions can use their administrative capacity to support economic recovery is developing effective technology use and acquisition strategies in host countries, which is a peacekeeping-wide policy goal outlined in the high-level Performance Peacekeeping report. Our paper introduces the theoretical channels through which missions' use of information communication technologies (ICTs) can support local economic development in post-conflict settings, making a theoretical argument that draws on both the literature on ICTs in peacekeeping and in economic development. We specify a Cobb-Douglas model that describes the potential impact of peacekeeping mission-led ICT investment on longer term economic development in combination with statistics on mission technology spending and internet use in host countries, providing a formal scaffold for our theoretical argument. Using this model and data in combination with a case study of the Central African Republic-based United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic mission, we argue that peacekeeping missions should use their purchasing power and stabilizing influence to attract value-added technology investment to support economic development.

Abstract: Bertrand Badie's thought opened up a number of new research avenues in the field of international relations, on topics ranging from diplomacy to power strategies to the effects of globalization. Yet one of the contributions of that thought remains relatively unexplored in international relations literature: the discussion surrounding the sociology of the state and contemporary statebuilding. This article examines that contribution by way of the dialectic between Weberian and Durkheimian approaches to the state-a dialogue between two founding fathers of sociology that is one of the cornerstones of the Badiean approach to international relations. Using an analytic framework based on Badian's work on statebuilding, this article attempts to demonstrate how the latter can be rooted either in Durhkeimian questions of social cohesion (the "social legitimacy" approach) or neo Weberian questions of state capacity (the "institutional" approach). This article also explores the limits of the neo-Weberian approach while noting the complexity of putting a Durkheimian approach into practice.

Abstract: The usual arguments for decentralization by its advocates are that it can achieve accountability, transparency, participation and democracy. In reaching these goals, however, proponents of decentralization reform have articulated concerns about whether government officials have sufficient capacity to implement decentralization policies, particularly at local level. This article asserts that in Cambodia, where decentralization has unfolded gradually since its adoption some 15years ago, lack of capacity is not the main problem. Decentralization is designed and implemented as part of the ruling political party's strategy to strengthen its grip at the sub-national level rather than as an exercise for improving accountability and democracy. Although decentralization is unlikely to lead to democratic gains, it does provide an opportunity for the rejuvenation of a patronage-based party in ways that could increase state capacity and improve development outcomes.

Abstract: Although environmental flow regime assessments are becoming increasingly holistic, they rarely provoke water managers to enact the adaptive water reallocation mechanisms required to secure environmental water for wetlands. The conditions that cause science-based environmental flow assessments to succeed or fail in informing the management of environmental water requirements remain unclear. To begin to resolve these conditions, we used process tracing to deconstruct the sequence of activities required to manage environmental water in four case studies of seasonally ponding wetlands in Mediterranean and Mesoamerican watersheds. We hypothesized that, when the flexibility and equitability of the socioeconomic system do not match the complexity of the biophysical system, this leads to a failure of managers to integrate scientific guidance in their allocation of environmental water. Diagnostic evidence gathered indicates that science-management partnerships are essential to align institutional flexibility and socioeconomic equitability with the system's ecohydrological complexity, and thus move from determination to reallocation of environmental water. These results confirm that institutions e.g., river basin organizations need to be supplemented by motivated actors with experience and skill to negotiate allocation and adaptive management of environmental water. These institutional-actor synergies are likely to be especially important in water scarce regions when the need to accommodate extreme hydrological conditions is not met by national governance capacity. We conclude by focusing on benefit sharing as a means to better describe the conditions for successful science-based environmental flow assessments that realize productive efficiency in environmental water allocation i.e., recognition of multiple values for both people and ecosystems.

Abstract: What determines cross-national variations in the extent of anti-government protests in Asia? Anti-government protests have surged across Asia in recent years, with many contributing to consequential political change. However, systematic cross-national comparison of the determinants of protests in Asia is still largely missing. This article fills this important gap by quantitatively examining the explanatory power of the three main theories of contentious politics-grievance, resource mobilization, and political process theories-in the Asian context with new data on anti-government protests in all 25 Asian states from 1990 to 2016. The analysis finds that urbanization, information and communication technology, and regional demonstration effects are the strong catalysts of anti-government protests in Asia, while repressive state capacity particularly dampens protests. The findings offer important insights into the dynamics of the anti-government protests that have become increasingly salient in Asian politics.

Abstract: Although climate change has been recognized as a "threat multiplier," its specific effects on conflict-affected areas remain underexplored. This study investigates the nexus between climate change and violent conflict within the "fragile geography" of Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province. Balochistan's increasingly fragmented security landscape and recurring natural disasters, notably the 2022 floods, provide a pertinent background for examining the interplay between climate change and violent conflict. A qualitative approach was employed, whereby interviews and group discussions were conducted in two Balochistan districts. The analysis revealed that weak institutional capacity, deep-rooted socioeconomic and political inequalities, and notably, "migration patterns" are critical variables influencing the dynamic interplay between climate change and violent conflict in the region. By analyzing the vulnerabilities inherent in Balochistan's diverse physiography, this study illuminates how climate change exacerbates violent conflict in a region already beset by instability, highlighting the urgent need for a more nuanced understanding to address these complex challenges.

Abstract: Veliger larvae of giant clams are demonstrable planktotrophs and provision of a particulate food source is generally accepted to improve hatchery production. However, the appropriateness of continuing to administer particulate food after larvae settle and develop as pediveligers is unclear. This study evaluated whether larval (age and size) and microalgal (species and cell density) factors influenced the capacity for pediveligers of Tridacna noae to ingest and digest cells from commercially available microalgae concentrates. Pediveligers at 6 and 10-days post-fertilisation were offered one of four microalgae species (Isochrysis sp., Pavlova sp., Tetraselmis sp., Thalassiosira weissflogii) at two cell densities (4000 and 8000 cells mL(-1)) and subsequently examined using epifluorescence microscopy. The appropriateness of continuing to administer microalgae as a food source was found to diminish as pediveligers approached metamorphosis, with negligible ingestion occurring at 10-days post-fertilisation. Earlier in development, at 6-days post-fertilisation, ingestion was significantly influenced by larval size, microalgae species, and microalgae cell density. Considering capacity for both ingestion and digestion, the Isochrysis sp. and Tetraselmis sp. microalgae concentrates had the greatest potential as a particulate food source for pediveligers of T. noae. The results of this study provide a basis for further refinement of giant clam hatchery procedures utilising microalgae concentrates as a larval food source.

Abstract: Government capacity and performance determine rise and fall of the country, as well as vital interests of all citizens. And it is these workers for government, government employees that have performed all kinds of government functions and organized various activities. Entering 21(st) century, New Public Service Theory was proposed, providing a set of valuable system and target model for administrative reforms, especially for the construction of service-oriented governments in many countries. Currently, China is endeavoring to construct a service-oriented government. Chinese citizens expect the government to function as a service provider, offering safeguard and service for legal activities to promote social progress. So it is of great significance to raise public satisfaction. And for above reasons, it is a necessity to probe into job satisfaction of government employees and public satisfaction. We should improve government employee management system based on "people-centered" principle, respect individual value and raise job satisfaction of government employees. Meanwhile, we should also strive for establishing Public Service Pledge System, conducting dynamic evaluation on the performance of government employees based on public satisfaction, and introducing government employee competition mechanism to raise public satisfaction.

Abstract: Disaster management planning is carried out widely around the world in different ways in developing and developed countries, but the implementation of such plans experiences challenges even in developed countries. This issue is discussed in the case of Bangladesh, a highly disaster-prone country where there is a strong institutional setup for disaster management. The National Plan for Disaster Management (NPDM 2016-2020) of Bangladesh was prepared by the author for the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and it is aligned with international frameworks including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). The plan's development process was inclusive, involving extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. While the planning process and the product itself were rigorous, its promulgation in terms of translating into implementation, institutional capacity building and uptake at different levels remains uncertain. While the plan has some key strengths, a number of constraints impede translation of the plan into action. Given Bangladesh's recent economic growth and progress in reducing disaster risk, there is the opportunity to implement NPDM 2016-2020, but this has gone unrealised, pointing to the need for a review that can identify how disaster management planning and implementation can flow seamlessly.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The use of fixed shelling percentage biases genotype selection in hybrid maize multi-environment yield trials

Abstract: Context or problem: Phenotyping is an integral part of plant breeding operations. In many cases the trait measured is not identical to the target trait for reasons of speed and or cost. This is a form of indirect selection, where correlation between the trait measured and the target phenotype influences the rate of genetic gain. Low correlations lead to slow rates of genetic gain. In sub-Saharan African maize breeding programs, maize grain yield in breeding experimental plots is measured as a field weight (FW), which includes the grain and cob. The weight of grain from each plot is estimated as a standard proportion of grain to total ear weight using a shelling percentage of 80 %. This approach assumes that there is no genetic, environment or genetic by environment interaction in shelling percentage which, if present, would contribute to slower rates of genetic gain for grain yield. Objective or research question: This study investigated the magnitude of genetic and environmental variation in shelling percentage and its impact on selection in six hybrid maize multi -environment yield trials in Ethiopia over two seasons. Methods: The data of shelled grain weight (SW) and cob weight (CW) from the trials were analyzed using a bivariate linear mixed model. Results: Genetic variances for both traits varied across the six testing sites ranging from 0.199 to 2.975 for SW and from 0.029 to 0.245 for CW. The genetic correlations between pairs of sites for SW and CW also varied, indicating the existence of genotype by environment interaction for these traits. Additionally, the bivariate regressions between FW and SW indicated there was substantial genetic deviation around the 80 % shelling response, and this relationship was impacted by environmental influences. Conclusion: The use of a constant relationship of 80 % shelling biases grain yield prediction in multi -environment hybrid maize yield trials and thus reduces the rate of genetic gain in maize breeding programs. Implications or significance: Taking into account the variations in the shelling percentage of the genotypes across sites in predicting grain yield from field weight improves the accuracy of genotype selection and the rate of genetic gain in maize breeding programs.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of two national-level studies of REDD+ governance values in Nepal and Papua New Guinea (PNG), using a hierarchical framework of principles, criteria, and indicators (PC&I), with evaluation at the indicator level. The research was conducted by means of an online survey to determine general perspectives on the governance quality of REDD+, as well as stakeholder workshops, in which participants were asked to rank indicators on the basis of perceived national significance. In the online survey, respondents in both countries identified inclusiveness and resources as the highest and lowest scoring governance values, while inclusiveness, resources, accountability, and transparency, were given priority, although their relative importance differed between countries given national circumstances. The reasons for the commonalities and differences of perceptions between these countries are discussed. The findings suggest that while a generic set of governance values may be usefully applied for determining the institutional legitimacy of REDD+, their relative importance is different. This leads to the conclusion that it may not be appropriate to use a simplified approach to REDD+ governance, focusing for example on safeguards, given different national priorities and contexts.

Abstract: This paper explains cross-market variations in the degree of return predictability using the extreme bounds analysis (EBA). The EBA addresses model uncertainty in identifying robust determinant(s) of cross-sectional return predictability. Additionally, the paper develops two profitable trading strategies based on return predictability evidence. The result reveals that among the 13 determinants of the cross-sectional variation of return predictability, only value of stock traded (a measure of liquidity) is found to have robust explanatory power by Leamer's (1985) EBA. However, Sala-i-Martin's (1997) EBA reports that value of stock traded, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, level of information and communication technology (ICT) development, governance quality, and corruption perception are robust determinants. We further find that a strategy of buying (selling) aggregate market portfolios of the countries with the highest positive (negative) return predictability statistic in the past 24 months generates statistically significant positive returns in the subsequent 3 to 12 months. In the individual country level, a trading rule of buying (selling) the respective country's aggregate market portfolio, when the return predictability statistic turns out positive (negative), outperforms the conventional buy-and-hold strategy for many countries.

Abstract: In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters. Some of the world's most earthquake-prone zones are also areas of high population density. The impact is magnified by vulnerability factors including non-enforcement of building codes, knowledge gaps, urban poverty and poor governance capacity to manage and reduce earthquake risks. Poor security of land tenure and property rights increases the vulnerability of people and affects their ability to respond to natural disasters. Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Incrementalism, housing supply and city-making from below: learning from Khulna, Bangladesh

Abstract: Incrementalism is a mode of self-help and continuing practice that is prevalent primarily in the Global South. It enables owner-builders to meet housing needs typically over an extended period of time as they can more conveniently manage the required resources. While (informal) tenure, materiality, and housing conditions have long been the focus of incremental housing scholarship, researchers are increasingly recognising the value of incrementalism's metabolic interplay with broader urban processes. This paper complements these later works by qualitatively examining four dominant incremental housing pathways in the urban fringes of Khulna, Bangladesh: absentee landholding, makeshift sheltering, speculative land disposal and informal brokerage. Empirical evidence suggests that a variety of actors, primarily motivated by land speculation, participate in these incremental housing pathways. While the implementation of the official plan for Khulna's peri-urban areas is delayed, I argue that these actors coproduce a complex housing market as well as a self-help city in which urban institutions play more passive and reactionary roles. The findings contribute to rethinking the self-organising logic of urban expansion in many Southern cities, which is often centred on urban land at the crossroads of institutional capacity deficit, speculative housing demand and supply, and informal-formal hybridity.

Abstract: Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly transmissible infectious disease killing millions of people yearly, particularly in low-income countries. TB is most likely to be transmitted in healthcare settings with poor infection control practices. Implementing TB infection prevention and control (TB-IPC) is pivotal to preventing TB transmission in healthcare settings. This study investigated diverse stakeholders' perspectives relating to barriers and strategies for TB-IPC in rural hospitals in Papua New Guinea.Methods Multiple qualitative case studies were conducted with 32 key stakeholders with experience in TB services. Data collection drew on three primary sources to triangulate data: semi-structured interviews, document reviews and field notes. The data were analyzed using hybrid deductive-inductive thematic analysis.Results Our results reveal that key stakeholders perceive multiple interdependent factors that affect TB-IPC practice. The key emerging themes include strategic planning for and prioritizing TB-IPC guidelines; governance, leadership and accountability at the provincial level; community attitudes towards TB control; institutional capacity to deliver TB care, healthcare workers' safety, and long-term partnership and integration of TB-IPC programmes into the broad IPC programme.Conclusions The evidence suggests that a multi-perspective approach is crucial for TB-IPC guidelines in healthcare institutions. Interventions focusing on addressing health systems strengthening may improve the implementation of TB-IPC guidelines.

Abstract: This paper investigates the views of multi-stakeholders on the governance quality of existing forest management strategies for red panda (Ailurus fulgens) protection in Nepal, focusing on forest governance in general, red panda conservation programmes and natural habitat protection in particular. The study deployed two surveys in August and September 2020. The first survey was conducted online for the stakeholders with internet access; for those without, it was conducted over the phone. While the results reveal almost similar perspectives among the stakeholders regarding the effectiveness of the red panda management approaches, they differ significantly between the online survey and telephonic survey, in terms of the relative scores given to these initiatives. In depth, follow-up interviews revealed that marginalised groups had little access to income generation from conservation activities and few capacity-building opportunities. These findings indicate that while management strategies for red panda conservation were generally considered effective by online survey participants which are generally more privileged, this is less effective for marginalised people. Local people, who are typically resource-poor and reliant on the forest, continue to endure inequitable resource distribution and benefit sharing. Consequently, greater attention should be paid to balancing the conservation needs and basic needs of forest-dependent communities through capacity building, income generation and alternative sources of livelihood.

Abstract: After decades of military rule, internal conflict, and international isolation, Myanmar has embarked on a course of institution building. In light of Myanmar's low rating on the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (World Bank Group), the nation faces an enormous challenge in developing public institutions that meet its needs and expectations. This challenge includes development of institutional capacity that will allow Myanmar to participate in international economic affairs. A step in this direction involves the creation of a securities exchange market mechanism. The current study considers the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Myanmar (SECM) to support securities regulation. It applies a novel organization level of analysis strategy that considers SECM as a 'pocket of effectiveness' (POE) in the context of a low-performing public institutional setting in terms of the good governance criteria of responsiveness, accountability, and transparency (RAT). While the study finds evidence of progress in building Myanmar's securities regulation, it also finds limits in RAT development that challenges the SECM's potential designation as a 'POE'. Based on feedback from proximate stakeholders in the daily work of the SECM, recommendations are offered for revised policies and practices in order to resolve them.

The breakdown analysis shows that most of the key components (control of corrup-tion, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and accountability) of institutional quality enhance the financial sector development. Our empirical results are robust across alternative measures of institutional quality, split-sample analysis, alternative instrument, and estimator.

Abstract: Party politics in Indonesia's current democratic regime takes place within the parameters of a heavily fragmented multi-party system. Factionalism exists in most parties, but the influence of factions on internal party dynamics is only weak to moderate. Where factions exist, they are usually driven by clientelism and patronage rather than the representation of social cleavages, ideological differences, or regional affiliations, although traces of programmatically infused factionalism do persist in some parties. The intensity of factional conflicts in Indonesia's young democracy has varied significantly over time and across different parties. While temporal variations are mostly related to changing institutional incentive structures, disparities between individual parties can be attributed to different organisational histories and structures as well as divergent levels of rootedness in social cleavage structures. It is noteworthy that several Indonesian parties have relatively deep roots in society and, in some cases, close links to long-established civil society organisations that preceded party formation. Given these constraints on more severe factionalism, damaging effects on governance have been fairly limited. The most debilitating effects of factionalism have been felt within the parties themselves, whereas government effectiveness and coalition formation has, ironically, sometimes benefitted from factional disputes.

Abstract: In recent years, China's central government has begun to articulate its adaptation policy and to identify measures to adapt the nation's agriculture to changing precipitation patterns, higher temperatures, and extreme events. These developments are occurring at a time when the agricultural sector is in flux: while the major grain cropsrice, wheat, and cornare still central to food security, many smallholder farmers have shifted away from land-intensive production to growing higher-value, labour-intensive horticultural products, such as fruit and vegetables. In addition, new forms of agriculture are emerging because of out-migration and land transfers. This review introduces the adaptation policy context for agricultural adaptation in China and reviews existing research on impacts and adaptation. It then discusses how well existing research and policy actually reflect the challenges of adapting China's farms to climate change. Four issues are discussed which together suggest that current science and policy very poorly reflect challenges on the ground: the framing of agriculture as a relatively homogeneous sector; the absence of any vulnerability assessments attuned to local contexts; a bias toward large-scale engineering solutions; and insufficient consideration of local government capacity.

Abstract: Fisheries provide nutrition and livelihoods for coastal populations, but many fisheries are fully or over-exploited and we lack an approach for analysing which factors affect management tool performance. We conducted a literature review of 390 studies to assess how fisheries characteristics affected management tool performance across both small-scale and large-scale fisheries. We defined success as increased or maintained abundance or biomass, reductions in fishing mortality or improvements in population status. Because the literature only covered a narrow set of biological factors, we also conducted an expert elicitation to create a typology of broader fishery characteristics, enabling conditions and design considerations that affect performance. The literature suggested that the most commonly used management tool in a region was often the most successful, although the scale of success varied. Management tools were more often deemed successful when used in combination, particularly pairings of tools that controlled fishing mortality or effort with spatial management. Examples of successful combinations were the use of catch limits with quotas and limited entry, and marine protected areas with effort restrictions. The most common factors associated with inadequate biological performance were structural' issues, including poor design or implementation. The expert-derived typologies revealed strong local leadership, high community involvement and governance capacity as common factors of success across management tool categories (i.e. input, output and technical measures), but the degree of importance varied. Our results are designed to inform selection of appropriate management tools based on empirical data and experience to increase the likelihood of successful fisheries management.

Abstract: In recent years, growing water insecurity in the Himalayan region has attracted new scientific research and fresh attention on policy. In this paper, we synthesize field research evidence from a sample of five Himalayan cities three in Nepal and two in the western Indian Himalayas on various forms of water insecurity and cities' responses to such challenges. We gathered evidence from a field research conducted in these cities between 2014 and 2018. We show how different types of Himalayan towns (mainly hilltop, foot hill, river side, touristic, and regional trading hub) are struggling to secure water for their residents and tourists, as well as for the wider urban economy. We found that even though the region receives significant amounts of precipitation in the form of snow and rainfall, it is facing increasing levels of water insecurity. Four of the five towns we studied are struggling to develop well-performing local institutions to manage water supply. Worse still, none of the cities have a robust system of water planning and governance to tackle the water challenges emerging from rapid urbanization and climate change. In the absence of a coordinated water planning agency, a complex mix of government, community, and private systems of water supply has emerged in the Himalayan towns across both Nepal and India. There is clearly a need for strengthening local governance capacity as well as down-scaling climate science to inform water planning at the city level.

Abstract: This paper traces the logic, goals and changed socio-ecological relations and water norms introduced by donorand state-led drinking water supply schemes to small urbanising settlements across the lower Himalayas of India and Nepal. While urban development and water planning tend to boundarise needs and interventions to city limits and city-dwellers, we adopt a hydro-social lens to trace the impacts and consequences of infrastructure and water as both travel through the landscape. Investments into water supply introduce new scales, spatialities and visions for urban development that actively peripheralise rural needs and interests, and introduce new dependencies for infrastructural maintenance that stretch the institutional and governance capacity of towns, such as around energy, finance, and expertise. We fmd that water supply projects give rise to new power differentials and development trajectories between more-powerful, typically urban and down-stream communities, and rural, up-stream source regions. Projects bring new potentials but also disrupt old relations and customs around water, resulting in the emergence of conflicts within and beyond towns as water availability and access opportunities change. Application of a hydro-social and urban metabolism focus to Himalayan waterscapes makes visible the environmental and societal trade-offs associated with resource provisioning to urban development centres.

Inland fisheries pose challenges, but also provide opportunities for biological assessments that differ from those encountered in large marine fisheries for which many of our assessment methods have been developed. These include the number and diversity of fisheries, high levels of ecological and environmental variation, and relative lack of institutional capacity for assessment. In addition, anthropogenic impacts on habitats, widespread presence of non-native species and the frequent use of enhancement and restoration measures such as stocking affect stock dynamics. This paper outlines various stock assessment and data collection approaches that can be adapted to a wide range of different inland fisheries and management challenges. Although this paper identifies challenges in assessment, it focuses on solutions that are practical, scalable and transferrable. A path forward is suggested in which biological assessment generates some of the critical information needed by fisheries managers to make effective decisions that benefit the resource and stakeholders.

Abstract: Identifying the robust determinants of corruption among cultural, economic, institutional, and geographical factors has proven difficult. From a policy perspective, it is important to know whether inherent, largely unchangeable attributes are responsible or if institutional and economic attributes are at work. Accounting for model uncertainty, we use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to analyze a comprehensive list of 36 potential corruption determinants across 123 countries (covering 87 percent of the world population). The BMA methodology sorts through all 68,719,476,736 possible model combinations (2(36)) in order to carve out the robust correlates. We then take a step toward alleviating endogeneity concerns in an Instrumental Variable BMA framework. Our results indicate that cultural factors are largely irrelevant, whereas particular economic and institutional characteristics matter. The rule of law emerges as the most persistent predictor with a posterior inclusion probability (PIP) in the true model of 1.00, whereas we find strong evidence for government effectiveness (PIP of 0.88), urbanization (0.85), and the share of women in parliament (0.80) as meaningful determinants of lower corruption levels. In developing countries, the extent of primary schooling enters as a powerful factor with a PIP of 1.00. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This study has the objective of examining how internal corporate governance mechanisms are related to earnings manipulation, measured by real-based earnings manipulation (REM) and accrual-based earnings manipulation (AEM). The internal corporate governance mechanisms discussed in this study signify two main kinds of board characteristics (board size and board independence) and three main kinds of ownership structure (institutional ownership, foreign ownership and business group affiliation). The study models were examined from eight countries selected from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. A total of 480 non-financial firms listed between 2012 and 2019 were examined. Based on panel data-based generalised methods of moments (GMM) estimation, the findings showed that institutional ownership in MENA nations limits the use of REM and AEM. Additionally, we found that larger boards are more likely to participate in REM practices. Board independence has a positive association with REM and AEM. The results also reveal that business group affiliation has a significant effect on both methods of earnings manipulation. Foreign ownership does not seem to significantly impact either of the two manipulation methods. Finally, these results help regulators and policymakers pursue reforms to enhance national governance quality in the MENA region.

Abstract: The concept of adaptive capacity is increasingly being applied to understand and predict people's ability to adapt to the emerging impacts of climate change. Despite its potential utility, the degree to which adaptive capacity is a reliable predictor of adaptation remains unclear; evidence for a causal relationship is insufficient and conflicting. To address this gap, we surveyed 231 reef tourism companies across eight countries in the Asia-Pacific that have been affected by severe climate disturbances between 2014 and 2019. We used a combination of descriptive and multivariate statistical approaches to explore the relationships between adaptive capacity, adaptive responses, and contextual conditions. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive operationalization of actor-specific adaptive capacity is not necessarily a reliable proxy for measuring potential adaptation to future climate change. The severity of impacts on individual operators was the major determinant of adaptive action. Adaptive action might therefore be adopted autonomously by the majority of microeconomic actors (when they are severely affected), irrespective of their a priori adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity was, however, a reliable proxy for the likelihood that an operator would take transformative action as their primary response to a climate disturbance; several of our indicators of adaptive capacity had a meaningful effect size, in particular those within the adaptive capacity domain of social organization. Policies focused on improving coordination and collaboration between industry, research, and government actors might therefore be more effective than alternatives in promoting long-term transformation of social-ecological systems. Adaptation confidence and government effectiveness were barriers to transformative action, and we provide some potential explanations. Further empirical research is needed to evaluate the generality of our findings in different contexts over space and time.

Abstract: This study explores the synergistic causal effects of remittance inflows, urbanization, and quality of governance on multidimensional food security in Pakistan using large-scale time-series data over the period of 1973-2019. We use a broad-spectrum approach to empirically estimate temporal symmetrical relationships. The analysis revealed that utilization of worker's remittance has a significant negative impact on multidimensional food security but not on food access. Urbanization growth was also found to be negative and had a significant effect on all dimensions of food security. On the other hand, we found an overall positive relationship of governance quality, agricultural share to GDP, and government development expenditures for food availability, access, utilization, and stability. The empirical analysis suggests that utilization of remittances in a developing country such as Pakistan has the potential to negatively influence food security by decreasing the area of cropland because of non-agricultural-induced investment. To deal with this problem, scholars should collaborate across multi-disciplinary boundaries and leverage the advantages of multidimensional research design to study the effects of capital inflows and various dimensions of food security. As policymakers and researchers become aware of these complex relationships, more can be done to understand the opportunities and risks for national, household, and individual food security and sustainable development.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Economic Reform and Corruption: Evidence from Panel Data

Abstract: The notion that economic reform can reduce corruption remains prevalent in the policy agenda of international financial institutions, especially of the World Bank. Economic reforms have, therefore, been carried out throughout various parts of the world to improve the performance of the economies. Using data from 94 low- and middle-income nations for the period 1996-2015, this study employs static and dynamic panel analysis to examine whether economic reform undertaken in accordance with the World Bank's reform programs negatively affects corruption. Our findings suggest that enhancing government effectiveness (i.e. independence of civil service from political pressure, provision of quality public services, effective policy formulation and the government's commitment to such policies) and improving public rights and civil liberties could be some of the most promising policies in terms of fighting corruption. The role of economic development and growth in real per capita income is also found to be significant in some of the specifications. However, the assertion that economic reform can reduce corruption is rejected in all the specifications. We rather find evidence that economic reforms negatively affect the ability of democracy to fight corruption, although on a slim margin. The central theme of the implications of our findings is that in combating corruption, social, institutional and legal means are far more important than economic means. The finding thus is compatible with the World Bank's effort in the later years to introduce governance and democracy as effective tool against corruption.

Abstract: We applied social network analysis to pig trader networks on the Kenya-Uganda border. Social network analysis is a recently developed tool, which is useful for understanding value chains and improving disease control policies. We interviewed a sample of 33 traders about their experiences with trade and African swine fever (ASF), analyzed the networks they generated in purchasing pigs and selling pork and their potential contribution to modulating dissemination of the ASF virus (ASFV). The majority of the traders were aware of clinical signs of ASF and the risk of trade transmitting ASFV. Most said they avoided buying pigs from ASF outbreak villages or sick pigs but their experiences also indicated that inadvertent purchase was relatively common. Traders had early knowledge of outbreaks since they were contacted by farmers who had heard rumours and wanted to sell their pigs to avoid the risk of them dying. Individual traders bought pigs in up to nine villages, and up to six traders operated in a village. Although each trade typically spanned less than 5 km, networks of the various traders, comprising movements of pigs from source villages to slaughter slabs/sites and retail outlets, and movement of pork to villages where it was consumed, linked up indirectly across the 100 km x 50 km study area and revealed several trade pathways across the Kenya-Uganda border. ASF could potentially spread across this area and beyond through sequential pig and pork transactions. Regulation of the pig and pork trade was minimal in practice. The risk of ASFV being spread by traders was compounded by their use of poorly constructed slaughter slabs/sites with open drainage, ineffective or non-existent meat inspection services, lack of provision for biosecurity in the value chain, and sales of pork to customers who were unaware of the risks to their own pigs from contact with ASF infected pork. More effective regulation is warranted. However, limitations on government capacity, together with the strong self-interest that established traders have in reducing the disruption and financial losses that outbreaks cause, highlight the importance of governments and traders co-developing an approach to ASF control. Formation of trader organizations or common interest groups warrants government support as an important step in engaging traders in developing and implementing effective approaches to reduce the risk of ASF outbreaks.

Abstract: Auctions are currently the dominant and most rapidly expanding form of support for renewable energy project deployment, capturing the interests of policy-makers and academics alike. This article provides a systematic review of the relatively recent but already abundant literature on auctions for renewable energy and proposes a future research agenda on the topic. Major themes, gaps in knowledge, and trends in the literature are highlighted. More research efforts will be needed on the institutional capacity and arrangements, coordination between auctions and other procedures and appropriate inclusion of auctions in policy mixes. The trade-offs between different criteria should be the focus of more rigorous and quantitative marginal analysis, identifying the extent to which improving a given criterion worsens another. The existence, causes and consequences of underbidding, the implications of the just energy transition for the performance of auctions and auction design, the marginal impact of the level of design elements and the interactions between design element choices in "design element packages" merit more attention. There should be a greater focus on the micro-level in the assessment of the success of auctions and auction design. At a methodological level, assessments of auctions with case studies should coexist with more quantitative studies on the topic, using a wide range of methodologies. However, the transferability of lessons on the functioning of design elements across different contexts will be necessarily limited. Finally, a plea is made to national governments and international institutions to facilitate the access to auction data.

Abstract: This study provides a first evaluation of different hatchery culture methods for the giant clam Tridacna noae. Three culture methods (intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive) using two tank designs (60 L and 277 L) were successful in producing 30-day old T. noae juveniles. There was no statistically significant interaction between tank design and culture method when considering cumulative survival (P = 0.89) or antero-posterior growth (P = 0.20), and the two tank designs did not influence cumulative survival (P = 0.78) or antero-posterior growth (P = 0.81). Differences in cumulative survival among the extensive (0.027 +/- 0.015%), semi-intensive (0.005 +/- 0.002%), and intensive (0.004 +/- 0.001%) culture methods were non-significant (P = 0.11). The mean antero-posterior measurements at 30 days post-fertilisation among intensive (583.57 +/- 12.71 mu m), semi-intensive (530.92 +/- 11.02 mu m), and extensive methods (541.67 +/- 10.95 mu m), were also non-significant (P = 0.05). Further analysis of survival among different developmental stages identified significantly greater survival of T. noae between the pediveliger and juvenile development stages within the extensive culture method. Our results show that extensive culture methods can achieve comparable hatchery production of T. noae to semi-intensive and intensive culture methods, which require additional managerial, infrastructural, and nutritional inputs.

Abstract: Protected areas have been gazetted to protect natural resources and biodiversity, but evaluations of effectiveness rarely include measures of species population change. We compiled annual site-level spending and elephant population data for 102 protected areas conserving either savannah (Loxodonta africana) or forest (Loxodonta cyclotis) elephants, which showed a median annual population decline of -0.78% across the protected areas. Site-level population change was strongly associated with funding and government effectiveness. Annual funding deficits occurred in 78% of the protected areas, and when comparing necessary levels of annual spend to stabilize elephant populations, we estimate a US$1.5 billion annual funding deficit across all the protected areas. While financial investment can improve elephant conservation outcomes, there is still a need to identify where and how to best finance elephant poaching interventions, requiring a global commitment to improve the socioeconomic impacts of protected areas on local communities and reduce ivory demand.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to extend the New Public Financial Management concept and the contingency model approach to an analysis of the determinants of the accrual-based International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) adoption process as a financial management reform in Sri Lanka, a developing country in Asia. Design/methodology/approach Based on the prior literature, this paper develops a framework to highlight the importance of accrual-based reforms in public sector accounting policies to enable better transparency and accountability. It shows the extent to which Sri Lankan public sector institutions have adopted IPSAS-based accounting standards and the limitations of adopting these standards in a developing country, using documentary analysis. Findings In developing countries, the public sector faces practical problems when adopting reforms due to limited institutional capacity, high political involvement and bureaucracy in decision making. This paper concludes that significant policy changes towards the adoption of international accounting standards have gained momentum over the last decade in Sri Lanka while the much larger economies in Asia are still studying this process. However, the prevailing political uncertainty in Sri Lanka has negatively impacted the implementation process. Originality/value Relatively little is known about the diffusion of, and the difficulties in, implementing accrual-based IPSAS in the Asian region. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by exploring the Sri Lankan experience. This could be applied by other developing countries in Asia, including the high-growth nations, for policy adoption and accounting harmonisation.

Abstract: Critical feminist reviews of gender mainstreaming suggest a widespread disillusionment with gender and development. The literature has been dominated, however, by accounts of gender mainstreaming in international development institutions and in Western countries. There is a shortage of studies on how developing countries conceptualize, design and manage gender mainstreaming in development policies and programs in specific political and economic contexts. This paper focuses on Indonesia which made gender mainstreaming a national policy while battling the impacts of the Asian economic crisis and experiencing a political transition from authoritarianism to democracy. This strategic moment created some opportunities and challenges for government, NGO, and international gender and development advocates to integrate gender into the national poverty reduction policy. An analysis of the policy drafts and interviews with key players in the policy process shows that gender expertise, institutional capacity, organizational resistance, and leadership at the national level were important factors. Broader political concerns such as the diminished standing of World Bank and the IMF in post-crisis Indonesia also played a role in the long-winded policy process that produced the Indonesia's National Poverty Reduction Strategy. One important lesson drawn from this case study is the need to indigenize gender mainstreaming, by building gender analysis capabilities in national women's machineries and forging stronger links with national and local gender-concerned NGOs and research institutions. Secondly, translating gender-aware poverty reduction policies into gender-responsive action remains a great challenge not only in Indonesia but elsewhere due to paucity of relevant gender-disaggregated data.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the extensive use of bans (temporary prohibitions or moratoriums) on resource exploitation activities by the government of Laos as an authoritarian environmental governance tool. We focus on bans enacted recently in three sectors: on the granting of land concessions in 2012, on the expansion of banana plantations in 2014, and on logging exports in 2016. Bans have long been used in Laos, particularly in the forestry sector, despite their considerable political risk and economic costs, the way they contradict state actors' promotion of these same activities as drivers of development, and their past ineffectiveness. Most cases in the environmental authoritarian literature explore authoritarian states with a strong capacity to employ top-down governance tools. We argue, in contrast, that the Lao government's repeated use of bans instead of other effective governing tools, such as more incremental, conditional, or incentive-based policies, reflects not strong state capacity but rather the limits to its implementing and enforcement capacity. The bans examined emerge from central-local divides, unregulated village land leasing, and failures to extract state revenues, and we interpret them as central-state efforts to consolidate and assert a more centralized, command-and-control authority over the country's land and resources.

Abstract: In the current stage of urbanization in China, urban construction has gradually shifted from incremental construction dominated by real estate to stock transformation based on improving urban quality. The evaluation of urban renewal projects is crucial for decision-making and resource allocation. However, there is no consensus on the evaluation indicators and methods. This study evaluates the current status of urban quality using the MABAC method based on numerical indicators. It evaluates the improvement of urban quality using the VIKOR method based on public satisfaction indicators. It is found that the comprehensive weights and subjective weights of the five first-level indicators in the evaluation index system of urban quality improvement in Shandong Province, namely blue-green space improvement, air cleanliness improvement, road traffic improvement, life service improvement, and governance capacity improvement, are quite different. The weight distribution of these indicators needs to be adjusted and optimized, especially for improving living services, as well as secondary indicators such as black and odorous water treatment, urban clean heating, the number of public vehicles per 10,000 people in the city, the 15 min living circle, the renovation of old residential areas, and the construction of urban intelligent management platforms. Based on the comprehensive evaluation results, an attempt is made to propose a more scientific evaluation index system, providing valuable references for urban renewal management.

Abstract: Background: Little is known about the influence of the site of research or publication on the impact of the research findings on clinical practice, particularly in developing countries. The International Clinical Epidemiology Network ( INCLEN) is dedicated to improving the quality of health research in the Developing World through institutional capacity building for evidence based medicine, and provided the opportunity to examine the likely impact of research location and journal location on physicians' practice in a number of the participating countries. Methods: Physicians from secondary and tertiary hospitals in six cities located in China, Thailand, India, Egypt and Kenya were enrolled in a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The primary outcome measures were scores on a Likert scale reflecting stated likelihood of changing clinical practice depending on the source of the research or its publication. Results: Overall, local research and publications were most likely to effect change in clinical practice, followed by North American, European and regional research/publications respectively, although there were significant variations between countries. The impact of local and regional research would be greater if the perceived research quality improved in those settings. Conclusion: Conducting high quality local research is likely to be an effective way of getting research findings into practice in developing countries.

Abstract: There is now widespread acceptance of the universal coverage approach, presented in the 2010 World Health Report. There are more and more voices for the benefit of creating a single national risk pool. Now, a body of literature is emerging on institutional design and organizational practice for universal coverage, related to management of the three health-financing functions: collection, pooling and purchasing. While all countries can move towards universal coverage, lower-income countries face particular challenges, including scarce resources and limited capacity. Recently, the Lao PDR has been preparing options for moving to a single national health insurance scheme. The aim is to combine four different social health protection schemes into a national health insurance authority (NHIA) with a single national fund- and risk-pool. This paper investigates the main institutional and organizational challenges related to the creation of the NHIA. The paper uses a qualitative approach, drawing on the World Health Organization's institutional and Organizational Assessment for Improving and Strengthening health financing (OASIS) conceptual framework for data analysis. Data were collected from a review of key health financing policy documents and from 17 semi-structured key informant interviews. Policy makers and advisors are confronting issues related to institutional arrangements, funding sources for the authority and government support for subsidies to the demand-side health financing schemes. Compulsory membership is proposed, but the means for covering the informal sector have not been resolved. While unification of existing schemes may be the basis for creating a single risk pool, challenges related to administrative capacity and cross-subsidies remain. The example of Lao PDR illustrates the need to include consideration of national context, the sequencing of reforms and the time-scale appropriate for achieving universal coverage.

Abstract: Managers are increasingly being asked to integrate climate change adaptation into public land management. The literature discusses a range of adaptation approaches, including managing for resistance, resilience, and transformation; but many strategies have not yet been widely tested. This study employed in-depth interviews and scenario-based focus groups in the Upper Gunnison Basin in Colorado to learn how public land managers envision future ecosystem change, and how they plan to utilize different management approaches in the context of climate adaptation. While many managers evoked the past in thinking about projected climate impacts and potential responses, most managers in this study acknowledged and even embraced (if reluctantly) that many ecosystems will experience regime shifts in the face of climate change. However, accepting that future ecosystems will be different from past ecosystems led managers in different directions regarding how to respond and the appropriate role of management intervention. Some felt management actions should assist and even guide ecosystems toward future conditions. Others were less confident in projections and argued against transformation. Finally, some suggested that resilience could provide a middle path, allowing managers to help ecosystems adapt to change without predicting future ecosystem states. Scalar challenges and institutional constraints also influenced how managers thought about adaptation. Lack of institutional capacity was believed to constrain adaptation at larger scales. Resistance, in particular, was considered impractical at almost any scale due to institutional constraints. Managers negotiated scalar challenges and institutional constraints by nesting different approaches both spatially and temporally.

Abstract: Globally, rural areas suffer from less infrastructure relative to urban areas. Political and development economists have mainly attributed this disparity in infrastructure distribution to governance. The literature has sufficiently discussed the role that rural-urban infrastructure inequality plays in development outcomes such as poverty. However, not much is known about the effect of the rural-urban infrastructure gap on the environment. To contribute to knowledge and policy discussions, we investigate the impact of rural-urban energy access (in)equality on environmental degradation and the role governance plays using data from 47 sub-Saharan African countries from 2000-2020. Evidence from the heteroskedasticity-based instrumental variable regression consistent with Driscoll and Kraay's estimation revealed that bridging rural-urban energy access inequality is associated with reduction in environmental degradation. We also documented that the direct effect of the governance-related variables used is mixed. The moderation and marginal effect estimates showed that improving governance quality conditions equality in rural-urban energy access to reduce environmental degradation. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that the implementation of rural electrification policies supported by a good governance system would play a crucial role in mitigating environmental degradation in developing countries.

Abstract: The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) strategy for improving information on the status and trends of capture fisheries (FAO Strategy STF) was endorsed by Member States and the UN General Assembly in 2003. Its overall objective is to provide a framework, strategy, and plan to improve knowledge and understanding of the status and trends of fisheries as a basis for policy-making and management, towards conservation and sustainable use of resources within ecosystems. The FAO supports the implementation of FAO Strategy STF in developing countries through a project known as FAO FishCode-STF, and an initiative funded by the World Bank entitled the "BigNumbers project". The BigNumbers project underscored the importance of small-scale fisheries and revealed that catches by and employment in this sector tend to be underreported. An inventory of data collection systems made under the FAO FishCode-STF project showed that small-scale fisheries are not well covered. Their dispersed nature, the weak institutional capacity in many developing countries, and the traditional methods used make routine data collection cumbersome. Innovative sampling strategies are required. The main priority is a sample frame for small-scale fisheries. Sustainable strategies are most likely to be found outside the sector through population and agricultural household censuses and inside the sector through the direct involvement of fishers.

Abstract: Lack of data inhibits informed decision-making and is a critical challenge in developing countries, many of which are under-resourced in financial, technical and institutional capacity to collect and analyse the required data. This limits the countries' ability to achieve development goals and keeps them dependent on the provision of external resources. Development initiatives often treat capacity building and research as two separate tracks of development. While efforts have been made in the health sector to combine these through project-based learning, this approach is relatively unexplored in the water sector which by its inter-sectoral nature stands to benefit significantly from a more collaborative and solution-oriented development strategy. Capacity Building through Research (CBtR) facilitates data collection and analysis by local researchers, mentored by international experts, strengthening local capacity to produce credible evidence able to inform sustainability-related decision-making. Five case studies piloting CBtR are discussed here and evaluated through criteria of the Dutch Strategy Evaluation Protocol framework. CBtR is shown to be a long-term strategy that requires the strengthening of cross-disciplinary networks to enhance the capacity of water management institutions, which likely contributes to more efficient evidence collection and analysis suitable for decision-makers, leading to greater national resilience and reduced need for external support.

Abstract: Agro forestry is a land management system that integrates trees, agriculture crops, and animal farming in order to provide a diverse range of ecosystem services. Timor-Leste, the newest country and one of the least developed counties, has faced multidimensional challenges on land use management, including deforestation, land degradation, and poverty. The agroforestry system is recognized as one of the viable options for balancing the socio-economic needs and ecological functions of the lands in Timor-Leste. The system has been practiced traditionally by farmers in the country; however, the lack of knowledge and experience, limited institutional capacity, and lack of funding have impeded the wider implantation of the agroforestry system in Timor-Leste. The Strategic Development Plan of Timor-Leste has recommended sustainable agriculture and natural resources management in the rural areas of the country to generate income and create employment for the youths. The paper presents the initiatives, challenges, and opportunities of agroforestry application in Timor-Leste to support sustainable forest management and livelihood improvement.

Abstract: The growing number of areas facing water scarcity necessitates adaptive water management strategies beyond traditional water supply and demand management methods, which are becoming increasingly difficult in many regions. Water reallocation offers a flexible water management approach to mitigate water scarcity under changing socioeconomic, climatic, and environmental conditions. In spite of the numerous benefits of reallocating water between users, examples of successful water transfers are relatively sparse and the expected benefits are rarely met in full due to several complex impediments. This study overviews the current body of water reallocation literature, with a particular focus on the key barriers to wider implementation of water reallocation. We argue that to overcome these obstacles a more interdisciplinary approach to water reallocation should be advanced that couples developments in the natural sciences and engineering disciplines with current water reallocation scholarship, which is predominately rooted in the social sciences. Many examples of water transfers from around the world are used to illustrate both the benefits and challenges associated with reallocation, as well as to identify measures to overcome some of the major difficulties. We conclude by calling for an integrated research platform that focuses on supporting both voluntary and nonvoluntary forms of water reallocation; however, a greater emphasis should be on nonmarket means of water transfer since it is more feasible for many regions where water rights are not well defined and institutional capacity is insufficient.

Abstract: This paper explores the impacts of informal economic activities and institutional capacity, particularly, corruption control on the environmental quality degradation of emerging economies under the prevailing socio-economic conditions and energy use patterns of the countries. The study utilizes key environmental degradation indicators: Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, ecological footprints (EFs), and Nitrous Oxide (NO) emissions, and a panel dataset of 15 emerging countries for the period 2002-2019 to undertake an empirical investigation. The pooled mean group (PMG)-ARDL estimator, Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS), Dynamic OLS (DOLS) and Augmented Mean Group (AMG) methods have been applied as empirical investigation techniques. The empirical findings reveal that in the long-run informal economic activities positively affect the environmental quality with fewer recorded emissions of CO2 and EFs while these activities affect negatively to NO emissions. This study has also found that corruption control improves environmental quality by reducing EFs and NO emissions but works to the opposite by increasing recorded CO2 emissions. An increase in economic growth and renewable energy consumption improves environmental quality in emerging countries, while consumption of non-renewable energy degrades the environmental quality. The robust empirical findings advocate policy initiatives for intense monitoring of informal activities and implementation of indirect tax policy to regulate informal activities and the pollution they cause. Careful measures of corruption control and initiatives to bring the informal economic activities into a formal framework are suggested to reduce CO2 and NO emissions. An increase in economic growth with more focus on renewables and phasing out non-renewables can ensure green growth in emerging countries.

Abstract: Road traffic injuries are a leading cause of socio-economic loss in East Asia Summit (EAS) countries. A regular performance rating to monitor progress and calibrate interventions is crucial for road safety improvement, helping to save human lives and reducing economic losses. To this end, we propose a new and easy-to-adapt multi-criteria decision-making method for systematically rating the road safety performance of the EAS coun-tries, the preference selection index with principal component analysis of RIDIT scores (PSI-PRIDIT) (scores of a distribution relative to an identified distribution integral transformation). Using the results from other classical methods as a reference, we rank the EAS countries robustly and place them into three groups over the last decade (2009-2019), based on the composite road safety development index. Our findings should be useful for EAS countries to detect underlying problems and identify best practices, as well as provide government officials, policymakers, and practitioners with meaningful guidelines on the adoption of successful road safety measures. Overall, the proposed rating framework should help to strengthen the institutional capacity for road safety management and addresses road safety issues.

Abstract: Background: People living with HlV/AlDS (PLWHA) in developing countries are rarely consulted about ways to promote their health and well-being. This study sought to identify and understand, from the perspective of PLWHA, challenges and opportunities for improving access to HIV treatment, care and support in Vietnam, a resource-limited setting with an epidemic driven by injecting drug use. Methods: PLWHA trained in participatory research methods completed fieldwork and data collection and co-facilitated focus groups with injecting drug users (IDUs) in Ho Chi Minh City. Qualitative data were analysed in Vietnamese and English using an inductive approach to code and compare content and identify key themes. Results: Results suggest considerable barriers to scaling up in this setting. Against a backdrop of punitive government policies, including mandatory detention of IDUs and sex workers, and widespread stigma and discrimination, many PLWHA lived with the fear of discovery and the threat of abandonment. Lack of confidentiality, limited financial resources and restricted access to essential medications provided powerful disincentives to health service utilisation. Conclusions: Opportunities for scaling up lie firstly in expanding access to confidential HIV counselling and testing. However, in the absence of affordable, quality care and access to anti-retroviral therapy, IDUs are unlikely to see testing as worthwhile. Efforts to scale up also need to address structural barriers including stigma and discrimination, poverty and institutional capacity. Finally, PLWHA in Vietnam are a significant but underutilised resource and consideration should be given to overcoming barriers to building confidence and capacity within affected communities.

Abstract: The real estate sector has emerged as the bedrock of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies, and it has remained resilient despite the various unprecedented micro- and macro-economic shocks devouring the world's economies. However, wavering investor attitudes and minimal exposure to real estate investment vehicles, coupled with weak regulatory frameworks, have led to dramatic downturns in the sector. Transparency about what is happening in real estate is imperative if the success of high-profile initiatives is to continue and much depends on good corporate governance (CG) in the sector. Using the most recent data from 2019, the current study applies the CG Index (CGI) and CG Deviation Index (CGDI) constructs to the real estate (RE) sector in the GCC in an effort to develop vital indicators for future RE investment decisions in the GCC region. The results indicate that the highest CG adherence levels are being achieved in Dubai, followed by Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. The authors attribute these countries' success in CG adherence to the entrepreneurial identity of them RE firms as well as to their governance capacity, their socio-cognitive capability, and the level of regulatory enforcement within the context of their dominant governance logic. It should be noted that there are variations in adherence levels throughout each region. The results also agree with prior literature that a higher CGS leads to a lower CGD score, and vice versa. At this point, encouraging more real estate investment trust (REIT) formations in the GCC could ensure value propositions, such as liquidity, to both investors and RE companies as well as solid governance fundamentals. This is strongly recommended for increasing the RE presence and its contribution to the GDP of each country.

Abstract: Epifluorescence microscopy has numerous applications in molluscan research. Methods rely on distinguishing target fluorescent signals from natural fluorescence, termed autofluorescence, of a specimen. Limited research has been conducted on the autofluorescence of marine bivalves, which hinders development of epifluorescence microscopy techniques in this sector. We examined autofluorescence in larvae of the giant clam Tridacna noae to identify challenges and opportunities in applying epifluorescence microscopy to the study of giant clams. Under blue-light excitation (lambda(ex) = 460-490 nm) three sources of autofluorescence were identified in larvae of T. noae: (1) green autofluorescence of the gut region; (2) green autofluorescence of the 'dark bodies' anatomical structure; and (3) red autofluorescence of ingested zooxanthellae, Symbiodinium species. Each of these sources of autofluorescence varied in prevalence and relative intensity over the course of larval development. The multiple sources and varied wavelengths of the observed autofluorescence presents challenges for applying fluorescent labelling techniques. However, our study identifies epifluorescence microscopy as a novel means of examining larval ontogeny and the uptake of zooxanthellae in giant clams.

Abstract: The need for substantial economic, political, and social integration among economies and an effective domestic governance system to create a more inclusive and clean energy economy cannot be underestimated. Overreliance on biomass and other dirty fuels for cooking in developing countries has contributed to the global climate change challenge. In this study, we examine the impact of globalization and governance on adopting clean fuels and cooking technologies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Regarding analytical approaches, we deploy econometric techniques such as Driscoll-Kraay and instrumental variable generalized method of moment techniques to control econometric issues such as autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, cross-sectional dependence, and endogeneity. The findings indicate that globalization (economic, social, and political) and governance (government effectiveness, control of corruption, political stability, and the rule of law) drive the adoption of clean fuels and technologies for cooking. The results further reveal that right-wing political leaders contribute significantly to adopting clean cooking fuels and technologies in SSA, while left-wing and center-wing political leaders do not. These findings differ among the sub-regions in SSA. Furthermore, interaction and marginal effect analyses suggest that improving governance system enhances the effect of globalization on access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. Hence, improving the efficacy of the domestic governance system could enable globalization to speed up the adoption of clean fuels and technologies for cooking in SSA.

Abstract: Implementing mitigation measures to limit global temperatures to below 2 degrees C poses several challenges. Even though Nepal's global emission contribution remains minimal, the nation is committed to the net zero targets aligned with the Paris Agreement through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and Long-Term Low greenhouse gas Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) by 2045, where the biggest emitters like India, China and European Union (EU) aims to achieve net zero by 2070, 2060 and 2050 respectively. In this context, detailed and concrete insights on context specific factors that inhibit or enable Nepal's mitigation measures to robust climate action are still at its infancy. We assessed the enablers and barriers to implementing mitigation measures across the energy, transport and forestry sectors. For this, an adapted version of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC's) Feasibility Assessment Framework is used, with data triangulated through an extensive literature review, as well as qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews with sector- specific experts (n = 25), policymakers (n = 15) and industry managers (n = 10). Our results indicated that geophysical and topographical barriers are relatively less prominent. However, the institutional capacity and governance, and cross-sectional coordination inhibit the implementation of mitigation measures. Addressing institutional barriers, such as policy gaps, regulatory frameworks, capacity building and coordination challenges, is essential for unlocking the full potential of enablers and overcoming obstacles. This research serves as a valuable guide for countries like Nepal, helping them gain insights into the challenges they may encounter on their journey to net zero targets.

Abstract: Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals requires countries to determine targets for the protection, conservation, or restoration of coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests by 2030. Satellite remote sensing provides historical and current data on the distribution and dynamics of mangrove forests, essential baseline data that are needed to design suitable policy interventions. In this study, Landsat time series were used to map trends and dynamics of mangrove change over a time span of 30 years (1987-2017) in protected areas of Hainan Island (China). A support vector machine algorithm was combined with visual interpretation of imagery and result showed alternating periods of expansion and loss of mangrove forest at seven selected sites on Hainan Island. Over this period, there was a net decrease in mangrove area of 9.3%, with anthropic activities such as land conversion for aquaculture, wastewater disposal and discharge, and tourism development appearing to be the likely drivers of this decline in cover. Long-term studies examining trends in land use cover change coupled with assessments of drivers of loss or gain enable the development of evidence based on policy and legislation. This forms the basis of financing of natural reserves of management and institutional capacity building, and facilitates public awareness and participation, including co-management.

Abstract: According to an increasingly prevalent set of discourses and practices within environmental and development finance, cities across the Global South are facing a costly infrastructural crisis stemming from rapid urbanization and climate change that threatens to further entrench poverty and precarity for millions of people. The cost of achieving urban resilience across the world dwarfs available public finance, however, from both development banks and governments themselves. Meanwhile, vast amounts of money on capital markets are searching for profitable investment opportunities. The World Bank is attempting to channel return-seeking investment into urban infrastructure in response to these challenges. To harness this private finance, though, cities must be reformatted in investment-friendly ways. In this article, we chart the emergence of this discourse and associated practices within the World Bank. We call this rescaled and climate-inflected program of leveraged investments coupled with technical assistance Green Structural Adjustment. Drawing on policy documents, reports, and interviews with key staff, we examine programs that include Green Structural Adjustment to show how it aims to restructure local governments to capture new financial flows. Green Structural Adjustment reduces adaptation to a question of infrastructure finance and government capacity building, reinscribing both causes and effects of uneven development while creating spatial fixes for overaccumulated Northern capital in the Global South.

Abstract: Health systems of low and middle income countries in the Asia Pacific have been described as mixed, where public and private sector operate in parallel. Gaps in the provision of primary health care (PHC) services have been picked up by the private sector and led to its growth; as can an enabling regulatory environment. The question whether governments should purchase services from the private sector to address gaps in service provision has been fiercely debated. This purposive review draws evidence from systematic reviews, and additional published and grey literature, for input into a policy brief on purchasing PHC-services from the private sector for underserved areas in the Asia Pacific region. Additional published and grey literature on vouchers and contracting as mechanisms to engage the private sector was used to supplement the conclusions from systematic reviews. We analysed the literature through a policy lens, or alternatively, a 'bottom-up' approach which incorporates components of a realist review. Evidence indicates that both vouchers and contracting can improve health service outcomes in underserved areas. These outcomes however are strongly influenced by (1) contextual factors, such as roles and functions attributable to a shared set of key actors (2) the type of delivered services and community demand (3) design of the intervention, notably provider autonomy and trust (4) governance capacity and provision of stewardship. Examining the experience of vouchers and contracting to expand health services through engagement with private sector providers in the Asia Pacific found positive effects with regards to access and utilisation of health services, but more importantly, highlighted the significance of contextual factors, appropriate selection of mechanism for services provided, and governance arrangements and stewardship capacity. In fact, for governments seeking to engage the private sector, analysis of context and capacities are potentially a more useful frame than generalizable outcomes of effectiveness.

Abstract: Even many years after Marbury v. Madison, and even in the face of the spread of aggressive constitutional court review in democracies around the world, the ability of courts to assert their authority against the political branches continues to demand explanation. Especially in newly minted democracies, and most so in countries emerging from authoritarian rule, how courts can engage the misuse of state power remains a bit of a mystery. This Article examines the hitherto under-studied phenomenon of judicial deferral as providing some insight into how courts acquire the institutional capacity to engage in robust judicial review and, in particular, how the deferral of implementation avoids direct political confrontations for the judiciary. Unlike in the United States, constitutional court decisions around the world frequently delay the practical effect of their decisions. This Article explores various modes of judicial deferral, including suspended declarations of invalidity, doctrines of prospective overruling and progressive implementation, and more implicit or forms of delay involving narrow rulings paired with broad dicta. It also considers different functions served by judicial deferral, including practical concerns about smooth transition from one legal regime to another, democratic legitimacy and dialogue, and more political concerns about ensuring the legal and political preconditions necessary for effective judicial review; and the connections between these various 'first' and 'second' order modes and functions of deferral. Once examined in this light, it turns out that various deferral-based strategies have been used by courts in some of the most successful systems of constitutional review in recent years, including in Germany, India, Colombia, and Indonesia. Finally, this Article turns to both the preconditions necessary for successful deferral and the corresponding risks when delay simply postpones an inevitable conflict.

Abstract: The East Asian region generally and Southeast Asia in particular have long been associated with authoritarian rule. It is argued that the intensification of a range of environmental problems means that authoritarian rule is likely to become even more commonplace there in the future. Countries with limited state capacity will struggle to deal with the consequences of population expansion, economic development and the environmental degradation with which they are associated. A resurgence of authoritarian rule is made even more likely by China's 'successful' developmental example and the extent of the region's existing environmental problems. The dispiriting reality may be that authoritarian regimes - unattractive as they may be - may even prove more capable of responding to the complex political and environmental pressures in the region than some of its democracies.

Abstract: Notwithstanding a huge deposit of natural resources in West Africa, the region has consistently recorded unimpressive economic performances, thus prompting an important question: what other things, besides resources endowment, does the region need in order to grow? In an attempt to look into this, we examine the roles of FDI, globalisation, and economic-governance alongside that of natural resources endowment on the growth of the West African economy. Using the panel ARDL technique on the West African data covering 1996-2016, we confirm that the impact of natural resources endowment on economic growth is significant and positive. Also, FDI exerts a positive effect on economic growth, while the coefficient of globalisation is mixed. Finally, we find that government effectiveness stimulates the growth of the region; it, however, reduces the positive effect of natural resources endowment while regulatory quality enhances the positive effect of natural resources endowment on economic growth. Given these findings, the governments of West African countries are enjoined to further promote the economic institutions of the states - entrench public and civil services efficiency, promote the formulation and strict implementation of regulations and sound policies - in order to promote both domestic and foreign (private) investments. Also, the governments of the West African states should key-in to the globalisation agenda by enhancing the competitiveness of local markets in order to compete meritoriously with foreign firms.

Abstract: Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problems necessitate a methodology that is able to produce reliable and defendable decisions. This is especially the case when it comes to safety system analyses. This study constructs an integrated model, CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) - Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) - Spectral Clustering (SC) (i.e., CRITIC-MOORA-SC), which seamlessly incorporates three stages of MCDM (weighting, aggregating, and grouping) with decomposing into one process, with the capacity to deal with decision difficulties while maintaining a high level of reliability. The model is designed to support the transport safety analyses of 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as Timor-Leste, including measuring road safety development, ranking and grouping safety performances, deconstructing safety performance indicators, decomposing overall achievement, quantifying safety changes over the past decade, and benchmarking approved practices. Enhanced comparisons of the results indicate the reliability and practicability of the proposed model, verifying its applicability for realworld decision activities. By doing so, this study provides policymakers and managers in the ASEAN region, as well as other parts of the world, with a support tool for creditable analyses in transport safety, strengthening their institutional capacity in decision-making activities.

Abstract: This paper provides an introduction and overview for the special issue on systematic conservation planning in the species-rich and highly vulnerable Cape Floristic Region. Firstly, we outline the three major problems that created the need for a systematic conservation plan and implementation programme in the region, namely an existing reserve system that is not representative of biodiversity patterns and processes, escalating threats to biodiversity, and diminishing institutional capacity. Secondly, we present the framework used for the planning and implementation process, place the contributions to the special issue in this context, and summarise current implementation initiatives. Thirdly, we extract from these studies and our own experience a number of lessons that were learnt during the planning process. Foremost amongst these lessons is a requirement for effective incorporation of implementation issues at all stages of the planning process. Other lessons include the need to consult and involve stakeholders at the local (municipal) level, the importance of a common planning framework for all teams contributing to the plan, the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity concerns as an implementation mechanism, the requirement for a critical level of home-grown capacity for undertaking ecoregional planning, and the value of expert knowledge when incorporated into a systematic planning framework.

Abstract: State interventions to govern social vulnerability highlight the complexity of contemporary states, marked by neoliberal agenda but also by progressive interventions and the desire for effectiveness. This paper draws on collaborative research with government agencies on social vulnerability in the Hunter region to assess the desirability of undertaking critical geographies with the state. We see states as contested terrains invested with the institutional capacity to mobilise diverse political projects. We argue that critical research in partnership with states is possible, as are mobilisations of the agency of state institutions to promote progressive policy development. The paper explores how we might use engaged research to intersect with the production and circulation of texts, technologies and practices within the state apparatus to achieve desirable change. While critical research with the state involves uncertainties and compromise, with no permanent resolutions, we conclude that states must remain centred in our critical conversations and praxis. In this paper we advance the case for the critical possibilities of policy-oriented research with the state. We reflect on experiences of an engaged research project with state government agencies in the NSW Hunter Region involving the production and use of the texts and technologies as state interventions in social vulnerability. Working through the project's reflexive, collaborative methodologies and our use of critical GIS, we highlight the creation of opportunities to change how the components of social vulnerability were conceptualised, contest policymakers view of what was relevant, and shift framing rationalities and resultant state practices. As such the paper contributes to our knowledge of strategic research practices for pursuing critical, progressive projects with the state. Such engagement involves uncertainties and contingent compromise. Yet, as terrains of contestation wherein diverse political projects are assembled and propelled, states must remain centred in our critical conversations and in our critical praxis.

Abstract: Holothuria scabra (sandfish) is a tropical sea cucumber that has been over-exploited because of its high-value in the beche-de-mer trade. It is amenable to mariculture and the potential for community-based sea ranching has been investigated in the Tigak Islands of Papua New Guinea (PNG). A 5-ha trial sea ranch was established within the fishing grounds of an island community and protected from fishing for the duration of this study. Over 10 months, 5655 fluorochrome-marked H. scabra juveniles were stocked into the centre of the sea ranch. Linetransects were used to survey sea cucumber within and on the periphery of the sea ranch prior to stocking the sea ranch (October 2018) and at the conclusion of the study (February 2020). Additional collections of H. scabra were made at night in a 1-ha area around the stocking site. All H. scabra were weighed and checked for fluorochrome marks to determine cultured or wild origin. An estimated 3.7 +/- 0.9% of cultured H. scabra were recoverable in the post-stocking survey. Cultured juveniles were found at a significantly higher density only around the stocking site. Factors potentially contributing to low recovery of cultured H. scabra include mortality, being overlooked, migration and misidentification of cultured and wild individuals. Species richness and density of the wild sea cucumber community increased in response to stocking and protecting the sea ranch. Our results highlight the importance of site-specific monitoring and evaluation to assess the success of sea ranching. Despite low recovery, H. scabra mariculture remains a promising option in PNG, as wild stocks are predicted to decline with increased fishing pressure, thus limiting recruitment. This will be aided by improved production of release-size juvenile H. scabra, improved release protocols to promote higher recovery of cultured juveniles and improved community capacity to manage cultured and wild sea cucumber stocks.

Abstract: ObjectiveTo explore the clinical practices, risks, and maternal outcomes associated with postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). DesignSecondary analysis of cross-sectional data. SettingA total of 352 health facilities in 28 countries. SampleA total of 274985 women giving birth between 1 May 2010 and 31 December 2011. MethodsWe used multivariate logistic regression to examine factors associated with PPH among all births, and the Pearson chi-square test to examine correlates of severe maternal outcomes (SMOs) among women with PPH. All analyses adjust for facility- and country-level clustering. Main outcome measuresPPH, SMOs, and clinical practices for the management of PPH. ResultsOf all the women included in the analysis, 95.3% received uterotonic prophylaxis and the reported rate of PPH was 1.2%. Factors significantly associated with PPH diagnosis included age, parity, gestational age, induction of labour, caesarean section, and geographic region. Among those with PPH, 92.7% received uterotonics for treatment, and 17.2% had an SMO. There were significant differences in the incidence of SMOs by age, parity, gestational age, anaemia, education, receipt of uterotonics for prophylaxis or treatment, referral from another facility, and Human Development Index (HDI) group. The rates of death were highest in countries with low or medium HDIs. ConclusionsAmong women with PPH, disparities in the incidence of severe maternal outcomes persist, even among facilities that report capacity to provide all essential emergency obstetric interventions. This highlights the need for better information about the role of institutional capacity, including quality of care, in PPH-related morbidity and mortality.

Abstract: The interactions between conflict and local development has puzzled scholars and practitioners alike. This article explores why the advent of peace in Colombia's emerald-mining regions for the past few years, as well as a broader national peace process, has not delivered the expected development dividends among mining communities. We contrast differences in stakeholders' perceptions between levels of governance (local, regional and national). Based on the research, we conclude that while stakeholder collaboration is successful at the regional and national levels of governance, it fails at the local level. While peace has allowed an increase in mainstream business investment in mining, this has concentrated production in a few hands leading to a deterioration in many aspects of community livelihoods and wealth distribution. There has been a shift in the concentration of wealth and production from traditional elites to large companies. Communities noted a loss of collective assets and lack of community and institutional capacity to overcome pressing issues in a post-conflict market economy that favors those who control capital and technology. Based on an evaluation of community perceptions through a focus group methodology, this study recommends ways to prepare and better coordinate stakeholders to engage with complex relationships, and protect community assets in a collaborative governance scenario. This research suggests that political reconciliation processes amid complex resource geographies require greater devolution and community engagement on post-conflict economic development during the peace process itself.

This includes legislative and other institutional documents, coupled with interviews with veterinary officers, health officers and managers of the veterinary drug distribution centres were conducted to evaluate the extent of Grenada's compliance with the OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code in the use of antimicrobials in poultry production. Five thematic areas were evaluated: 1) legislative and institutional arrangements; 2) surveillance and reporting; 3) risks associated with the importation of poultry meat products; 4) ante-and post-mortem inspection; and 5) procurement and use of antimicrobials. The information revealed that the current legislative framework in Grenada does not adequately address poultry food safety and that there is a need to strengthen the synergies between the agricultural and health sectors to enable a more thorough monitoring of antimicrobials use in poultry production. There is a need to strengthen epidemiology of zoonotic diseases, provisioning of education and information for key stakeholders about the use of antibiotics and the development of a system to monitor antibiotic procurement, distribution and use in Grenada. These findings have implications for other small island states in the Caribbean that have similar limitations in institutional capacity and knowledge deficits in the prudent use of antibiotics.

Abstract: Background: In humanitarian settings, strengthening health systems while responding to the health needs of crisis-affected populations is challenging and marked with evidence gaps. Drawing from a decade of family planning and postabortion care programming in humanitarian settings, this paper aims to identify strategic components that contribute to health system strengthening in such contexts.Materials and Methods: A diverse range of key informants from North Kivu (Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC) and Puntland (Somalia), including female and male community members, adolescents and adults, healthcare providers, government and community leaders, participated in qualitative interviews, which applied the World Health Organization health system building blocks framework. Data were thematically analyzed according to this framework.Results: Findings from the focus group discussions (11 in DRC, 7 in Somalia) and key informant interviews (seven in DRC, four in Somalia) involving in total 54 female and 72 male participants across both countries indicate that health programs in humanitarian settings, such as Save the Children's initiative on family planning and postabortion care, could contribute to strengthening health systems by positively influencing national policies and guidance, strengthening local coordination mechanisms, capacitating the healthcare workforce with competency-based training and supportive supervision (benefiting facilities supported by the project and beyond), developing the capacity of Ministry of Health staff in the effective management of the supply chain, actively and creatively mobilizing the community to raise awareness and create demand, and providing quality and affordable services. Financial sustainability is challenged by the chronically limited healthcare expenditure experienced in both humanitarian contexts.Conclusions: In humanitarian settings, carefully designed healthcare interventions, such as those that address the family planning and postabortion care needs of crisis-affected populations, have the potential not only to increase access to essential services but also contribute to strengthening several components of the health system while increasing the government capacity, ownership, and accountability.

Abstract: Bangladesh has been a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) although implementation of the convention has been poor. We independently assessed the extent to which the program of work (POW) of the CBD has been implemented in Bangladesh by carrying out workshops involving local communities, conservation organizations, universities, and government departments involved in forest conservation. Our analyses indicate that there is little or no understanding of the ecosystem approach that is central to the CBD; forestry practices remain primitive and largely ineffective; forest destruction continues at high rates; restoration of degraded forests are minimal; protected areas are small and ineffective; indigenous peoples' rights are nominal and are outside any legislation; threats to species have been identified, but little is being done to reduce threats; there is no work on pollution and its mitigation; some work has been done to adapt to climate change; the institutional environment does not enable effective implementation of the ecosystem approach; laws and policies are ineffective; institutional capacity is poor; government will is limited or totally lacking; and knowledge base remains poor, although reporting has improved and various strategic plans have been formulated but never implemented. Thus, the implementation of CBD in Bangladesh requires systemic changes in policy at the institutional levels as well as complementary changes in attitudes and avenues of alternate income generation.

Abstract: Arsenic in well water can exhibit large spatial variability such that two neighboring wells within tens of meters may be safe or unsafe for drinking, which is why well switching is recognized and is being promoted as a useful mitigation strategy. In Meherpur Sadar of Bangladesh where a previous survey identified a mixture of safe (<0.05 mg L-1) and unsafe wells in most villages, UNICEF initiated a pay-for-use well screening and marking program. Local workers were trained to test arsenic using field test kits, and conducted testing at the request of the villagers who paid 20 taka (about USD 0.30) per test. Half of the fee from each test was paid to the tester, and the other half was put into a revolving fund established at the upazila level. Households with heavily contaminated sources switched to other wells. In Ujalpur village of Kutubpur Union and Fotapur village of Buripota Union where 77 and 37 sources were contaminated with >0.2 mg L-1 arsenic, 100 per cent and 50 per cent of the households switched to safe sources, respectively. An arsenic screening campaign using the pay-for-use model with local government capacity building and private sector engagement is being rolled out starting in 2012 to meet the demand expected from a mass media campaign for user paid arsenic testing. The model offers the advantage of making a crucial service available to rural villagers and increasing the likelihood of actions to reduce exposure.

Abstract: Reaching out to the poor and the informal sector is a major challenge for achieving universal coverage in lesser-developed countries. In Cambodia, extensive coverage by health equity funds for the poor has created the opportunity to consolidate various non-government health financing schemes under the government's proposed social health protection structure. This paper identifies the main policy and operational challenges to strengthening existing arrangements for the poor and the informal sector, and considers policy options to address these barriers. Conducted in conjunction with the Cambodian Ministry of Health in 2011-12, the study reviewed policy documents and collected qualitative data through 18 semi-structured key informant interviews with government, non-government and donor officials. Data were analysed using the Organizational Assessment for Improving and Strengthening Health Financing conceptual framework. We found that a significant shortfall related to institutional, organisational and health financing issues resulted in fragmentation and constrained the implementation of social health protection schemes, including health equity funds, community-based health insurance, vouchers and others. Key documents proposed the establishment of a national structure for the unification of the informal-sector schemes but left unresolved issues related to structure, institutional capacity and the third-party status of the national agency. This study adds to the evidence base on appropriate and effective institutional and organizational arrangements for social health protection in the informal sector in developing countries. Among the key lessons are: the need to expand the fiscal space for health care; a commitment to equity; specific measures to protect the poor; building national capacity for administration of universal coverage; and working within the specific national context.

Abstract: Background Qualitative studies evaluating maternal mental health services are lacking in Ethiopia, and the available evidence targets severe mental illnesses in the general population. We conducted a qualitative study to explore barriers to, enablers of, or opportunities for perinatal depression health services implementations in Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a total of 13 face to face interviews with mental and maternal health service administrators from different levels of the Ethiopian healthcare system. We interviewed in Amharic (a local language), transcribed and translated into English, and imported into NVivo. We analysed the translated interviews inductively using thematic framework analysis. Results The study identified: (i) health administrators' low literacy about perinatal depression as individual level barriers; (ii) community low awareness, health-seeking behaviours and cultural norms about perinatal depression as socio-cultural level barriers; (iii) lack of government capacity, readiness, and priority of screening and managing perinatal depression as organisational level barriers; and (iv) lack of mental health policy, strategies, and healthcare systems as structural level barriers of perinatal mental health implementation in Ethiopia. The introduction of the new Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGap), health professionals' commitment, and simplicity of screening programs were identified enablers of, or opportunities for, perinatal mental health service implementation. Conclusions This qualitative inquiry identified important barriers and potential opportunities that could be used to address perinatal depression in Ethiopia. Building the capacity of policy makers and planners, strengthening the mental healthcare system and governance should be a priority issue for an effective integration of maternal mental health care with the routine maternal health services in Ethiopia.

Abstract: Background: Many countries are responding to the global shortage of midwives by increasing the student intake to their midwifery schools. At the same time, attention must be paid to the quality of education being provided, so that quality of midwifery care can be assured. Methods of assuring quality of education include accreditation schemes, but capacity to implement such schemes is weak in many countries. Objective: This paper describes the process of developing and pilot testing the International Confederation of Midwives' Midwifery Education Accreditation Programme (ICM MEAP), based on global standards for midwifery education, and discusses the potential contribution it can make to building capacity and improving quality of care for mothers and their newborns. Methods: A review of relevant global, regional and national standards and tools informed the development of a set of assessment criteria (which was validated during an international consultation exercise) and a process for applying these criteria to midwifery schools. The process was pilot tested in two countries: Comoros and Trinidad and Tobago. Results: The assessment criteria and accreditation process were found to be appropriate in both country contexts, but both were refined after the pilot to make them more user-friendly. Conclusion: The ICM MEAP has the potential to contribute to improving health outcomes for women and newborns by building institutional capacity for the provision of high-quality midwifery education and thus improved quality of midwifery care, via improved accountability for the quality of midwifery education.

Abstract: Understanding local stakeholders' perceptions of co-management institutional activities serves a significant role in the proper functioning of the co-management institutions for the Sundarban mangrove forest conservation effort, but this currently remains unexplored. This study aimed to identify the current co-management institutions, co-management activities, and local people's understanding of these activities in the implementation of the co-management approach. The study was conducted in four villages in the Chandpai range of the Sundarban mangrove forest. Thematic content analysis was conducted on the qualitative data, which had been collected through key informant interviews at the local, regional and national levels, followed by focus group discussions in the study villages. The key forest co-management activities and practices identified were: forest protection and monitoring; meetings; local livelihood initiatives; and organisational supports. These comanagement activities were implemented through institutions largely situated at the local level, through Village Conservation Forum, People's Forum and Community Patrol Group; higher-level institutions included the Co-management Committee, where local, district and national stakeholders were represented. Local people with forest dependency were participating in forest co-management activities and their awareness of forest conservation and social network had increased. In addition, people who had received training from government and non-government organisations reported benefits such as improved resource harvesting techniques, organisational skills and practical knowledge, which would be useful in times of natural disasters. However, local people also reported a range of issues affecting their full participation, which included top down decision-making, insignificant financial support, absence of alternate income sources, lack of meeting places for VCF members, gender inequality in participation, corruption and lack of skill-based training. A key governance issue for the local-level forest co-management institutions was limited access to the government organisations who oversaw policy and institutional control. In contrast, non-government organisations provided important institutional capacity-building support to local communities, and acted as a conduit to higher level committees. Broader impact could be achieved by fostering local participation, especially that of women, through genuine collaboration with other stakeholders, and extending the lessons learned from the study villages through exchange visits and sharing of ideas with other VCF villages in the area.

Abstract: Despite the proposed ecological and systems-based perspectives of the settings-based approach to health promotion, most initiatives have tended to overlook the fundamental nature of ecosystems. This paper responds to this oversight by proposing an explicit re-integration of ecosystems within the healthy settings approach. We make this case by focusing on water as an integrating unit of analysis. Water, on which all life depends, is not only an integral consideration for the existing healthy settings (schools, hospitals, workplaces) but also highlights the ecosystem context of health and sustainability. A focus on catchments (also know as watersheds and river basins) exemplifies the scaled and upstream/downstream nature of ecosystems and draws into sharp focus the cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary context of the social and environmental determinants of health. We position this work in relation to the converging agendas of health promotion and ecosystem management at the local, regional and global scales-025EFand draw on evidence from international initiatives as diverse as the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Using water as a vehicle for understanding the systemic context for human wellbeing, health promotion and disease prevention draws inevitable attention to key challenges of scale, intersectoral governance and the complementary themes of promoting resilience and preventing vulnerability. We conclude by highlighting the importance of building individual and institutional capacity for this kind of integration-025EFequipping a new generation of researchers, practitioners and decision-makers to be conversant with the language of ecosystems, capable of systemic thought and focused on settings that can promote both health and sustainability.

Abstract: Many cities seek urban green infrastructure to improve their liveability amid rapid urbanisation and climate change. The changes brought by urban green infrastructure are often reflected in socio-economic growth and environmental health. Yet, the development agendas of many cities, especially in Africa, do not always reflect the benefits of urban green infrastructure. Framed around the Achimota Forest Reserve in Ghana, this study intends to open the discussion on urban planning-sustainability narrative by: (i) assessing the land use land cover changes of urban forests; (ii) analysing the factors influencing the changes in urban forests; and (iii) examining urban planning responses towards management of urban forests and their implications for urban sustainability. Mixed methods approach involving spatial data analysis, secondary data review, and agency and community interviews was used. Findings suggest a critical urban planning neglect, low institutional capacity and nonchalant community attitudes leading to a loss of Achimota Forest Reserve (about 0.35 % per annum) between 1999 and 2019. The findings show that there are rapid changes in the land use structure and integrity of the Achimota Forest Reserve, with both urban planning and sustainability implications on Accra. With rapid urbanisation and weak management regulatory framework, urban forest in the research area is affected by rapid encroachment of physical development and unauthorised practices by some urban residents. This research concludes that consideration and implementation of proactive approaches by management institutions are required to make urban forest sustainable and to ensure their ongoing provision of ecological services to the city.

Abstract: This study investigates the barriers to managing debris waste in the post-earthquake period in T & uuml;rkiye following the significant earthquakes of 2023. Debris waste in the aftermath of earthquakes poses significant challenges to society and the environment. Thus, the critical need for effective debris waste management is essential to identifying and prioritizing barriers that impede the process. The study fills a gap in the literature by integrating Interpretive-Structural-Modeling (ISM), Decision-Making-Trial, and Evaluation-Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Neutrosophic Fuzzy Sets (NFSs) methodologies to assess barriers in the management of earthquake debris waste. The integrated approach considers technical, economic, regularity, environmental, and social dynamics influencing debris waste management. The results show that the first causal barrier is the "lack of legal enforcement," which has the most significant impact. The lack of legal regulations is caused by insufficient financial, technical, and institutional capacity, especially in Turkiye and similar developing countries. Secondly, the "lack of awareness regarding the environment" is another barrier to effectively managing post-earthquake debris. To improve post-earthquake debris management, the study highlights the importance of barriers for policymakers to create effective and sustainable management strategies. It also contributes to advancing circular economy practices and achieving sustainable development goals 3-8-9 and 11. Further, it assists managers and policymakers in effectively managing debris waste after earthquakes by providing insights into the interrelationships of barriers and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: How do Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) evolve in Bangladesh regarding legislation? Who should be in the governance of SEA in Bangladesh? What future challenges lie ahead of this transition to the SEA system in Bangladesh, and how to address them? The application context of SEA is in its early stage of development in Bangladesh as an environmental assessment tool for policy, plans, and programs (PPPs). Nevertheless, SEA has meaningfully started to roll in many PPPs by the political will of some key government institutions in Bangladesh. In such a scenario, we aimed to review the progression of EIA to SEA evolution in line with the current legislative practice and environmental governance by archival research strategy. We have further addressed several significant issues: the future of SEA application in Bangladesh, SEA governance within the authorities and the future obstacles of the SEA system and how to overcome them in Bangladesh. This study shows a potential for applying the SEA for developing PPPs to ensure sustainable development in Bangladesh. However, there are still challenges ahead to make the SEA fully functional. The challenges include the environmental governance concerning SEA, encoding SEA guidelines, and legislations associated with SEA implementation. Moreover, capacity building, technical review of SEA quality, and approval process of SEA reporting and coordination among the government institutions are required. To address the challenges, governance for the institutional authority for SEA and ownership development is necessary. Furhtermore, amendment of existing environmental acts and guidelines to incorporate SEA, institutional capacity building by professional training and awareness development, mainstreaming SEA education and practices are required to overcome the challenges.

Abstract: In this paper we explain the current condition of the Bau-Bau River, examine community participation for management of the river system, and consider options for improving the institutional capacity for a community-based approach. This assessment is based on a research project with the following objectives: (1) analyse the biophysical and socio-economic condition of the river as a basis for future planning; (2) identify current activities which contribute waste or pollution to the river; (3) assess the status and level of pollution in the river; (4),analyse community participation related to all stages of river management; and (5) identify future river management needs and opportunities. Due to the increasing population in Bau-Bau city, considerable new land is required for housing, roads, agriculture, social facilities, etc. Development in the city and elsewhere has increased run-off and erosion, as well as sedimentation in the river. In addition, household activities are generating more solid and domestic waste that causes organic pollution in the river. The research results show that the water quality in the upper river system is still good, whilst the,quality of water in the vicinity of Bau-Bau city, from the mid-point of the watershed to the estuary, is not good, being contaminated with heavy metals (Cd and Pb) and organic, pollutants. However,the levels of those pollutants are still below regulatory standards. The main reasons for pollution in the river are mainly lack of management for both liquid and solid wastes, as well as lack of community participation in river management. The government of Bau-Bau city and the community are developing a participatory approach for planning to restore and conserve the Bau-Bau River as well as the entire catchment. The activities of this project are::(1) forming institutional arrangements to support river conservation; (2) implementing extension initiatives to empower the community; (3) identifying a specific location to establish an urban forest; (4) implementing demonstration projects for liquid system management; (5) promoting coordination amongst the different organisations and,agencies in the catchment; (6) improving,domestic,waste transportation; and (7) recycling waste to create compost material to become an income source for the community.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Toward a Coordinated Global Observing System for Seagrasses and Marine Macroalgae

Abstract: In coastal waters around the world, the dominant primary producers are benthic macrophytes, including seagrasses and macroalgae, that provide habitat structure and food for diverse and abundant biological communities and drive ecosystem processes. Seagrass meadows and macroalgal forests play key roles for coastal societies, contributing to fishery yields, storm protection, biogeochemical cycling and storage, and important cultural values. These socio-economically valuable services are threatened worldwide by human activities, with substantial areas of seagrass and macroalgal forests lost over the last half-century. Tracking the status and trends in marine macrophyte cover and quality is an emerging priority for ocean and coastal management, but doing so has been challenged by limited coordination across the numerous efforts to monitor macrophytes, which vary widely in goals, methodologies, scales, capacity, governance approaches, and data availability. Here, we present a consensus assessment and recommendations on the current state of and opportunities for advancing global marine macrophyte observations, integrating contributions from a community of researchers with broad geographic and disciplinary expertise. With the increasing scale of human impacts, the time is ripe to harmonize marine macrophyte observations by building on existing networks and identifying a core set of common metrics and approaches in sampling design, field measurements, governance, capacity building, and data management. We recommend a tiered observation system, with improvement of remote sensing and remote underwater imaging to expand capacity to capture broad-scale extent at intervals of several years, coordinated with strati fied in situ sampling annually to characterize the key variables of cover and taxonomic or functional group composition, and to provide ground-truth. A robust networked system of macrophyte observations will be facilitated by establishing best practices, including standard protocols, documentation, and sharing of resources at all stages of work flow, and secure archiving of open-access data. Because such a network is necessarily distributed, sustaining it depends on close engagement of local stakeholders and focusing on building and long-term maintenance of local capacity, particularly in the developing world. Realizing these recommendations will producemore effective, efficient, and responsive observing, a more accurate global picture of change in vegetated coastal systems, and stronger international capacity for sustaining observations.

Abstract: Latin American (LA) megacities are facing enormous challenges to provide welfare to millions of people who live in them. High rates of urbanization and limited administrative capacity of LA cities to plan and control urban growth have led to a critical deficit of urban green space, and therefore, to sub-optimal outcomes in terms of urban sustainability. This study seeks to assess the possibility of using real estate prices to provide an estimate of the monetary value of the ecosystem services provided by urban green space across five Latin American megacities: Bogota, Buenos Aires, Lima, Mexico City and Santiago de Chile. Using Google Earth images to quantify urban green space and multiple regression analysis, we evaluated the impact of urban green space, crime rates, business density and population density on real estate prices across the five mentioned megacities. In addition, for a subset of the data (Lima and Buenos Aires) we analyzed the effects of landscape ecology variables (green space patch size, connectivity, etc.) on real estate prices to provide a first insight into how the ecological attributes of urban green space can determine the level of ecosystem service provision in different urban contexts in Latin America. The results show a strong positive relationship between the presence of urban green space and real estate prices. Green space explains 52% of the variability in real estate prices across the five studied megacities. Population density, business density and crime had only minor impacts on real estate prices. Our analysis of the landscape ecology variables in Lima and Buenos Aires also show that the relationship between green space and price is context-specific, which indicates that further research is needed to better understand when and where ecological attributes of green space affect real estate prices so that managers of urban green space in LA cities can optimize ecological configuration to maximize ecosystem service provision from often limited green spaces.

Abstract: COVID-19 imposed unprecedented financing requirements on countries to rapidly implement effective prevention and control measures while dealing with severe economic contraction. The challenges were particularly acute for the 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR), home to the lowest average level of public expenditure on health of all WHO regions. We conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed, grey literature and publicly available sources to analyse the immediate health financing policies adopted by countries in the WHO SEAR in response to COVID-19 in the first 12 months of the pandemic, i.e. from 1 March 2020 to 1 March 2021. Our review focused on the readiness of health systems to address the financial challenges of COVID-19 in terms of revenue generation, financial protection and strategic purchasing including public financial management issues. Twenty peer-reviewed articles were included, and web searches identified media articles (n = 21), policy reports (n = 18) and blog entries (n = 5) from reputable sources. We found that countries in the SEAR demonstrated great flexibility in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including exploring various options for revenue raising, removing financial barriers to care and rapidly adapting purchasing arrangements. At the same time, the pandemic exposed pre-existing health financing policy weaknesses such as underinvestment, inadequate regulatory capacity of the private health sector and passive purchasing, which should give countries an impetus for reform towards more resilient health systems. Further monitoring and evaluation are needed to assess the long-term implications of policy responses on issues such as government capacity for debt servicing and fiscal space for health and how they protect progress towards the objectives of universal health coverage.

Abstract: Knowledge co-production (KCP) is presented as an effective strategy to inform responses to complex coastal and marine social-ecological challenges. Co-production processes are further posited to improve research and decision outcomes in a wide range of problem contexts (e.g., biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation), for example, by facilitating social learning among diverse actors. As such, KCP processes are increasingly centered in global environment initiatives such as the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. However, KCP is not a panacea, and much uncertainty remains about its emergence and implementation, in particular, the manner in which broader governance contexts determine the interplay of knowledge, power, and decision-making. Three objectives guide our analysis: (1) to interrogate more fully the interplay among social relations of power, knowledge production practices, and the (colonial) governance contexts in which they are embedded; (2) to consider the challenges and limitations of KCP in particular places by drawing attention to key governance themes and their implications for achieving better outcomes; and (3) to work toward a fuller understanding of "deep KCP" that cautions against a tendency to view knowledge processes in coastal and marine governance settings as an instrumental or techno-managerial problem. A qualitative and reflective approach was used to examine multiple dimensions of the interplay of KCP, governance, and power in several marine and coastal contexts, including Canada, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. In particular, our analysis highlights the importance of: (1) recognizing diverse motivations that frame co-production processes; (2) the manner in which identities, positionality, and values influence and are influenced by governance contexts; (3) highlighting governance capacity with respect to spatial and temporal constraints; (4) institutional reforms necessary for KCP and the links to governance; and (5) the relationship between knowledge sharing, data sovereignty, and governance. We seek to encourage those involved in or considering co-production initiatives to engage carefully and critically in these processes and make co-production more than a box to tick.

Abstract: One of the most striking features of the economic development that has occurred in the East Asian region has been the influential role of the state in directing its course. Vietnam is also following this well-worn path of state-led developmentalism. The principal contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we place the Vietnamese experience in comparative historical and conceptual perspective. It is suggested that the structure of the Vietnamese state itself and the distinctive nature of the policies it has undertaken are reflections of the country's traumatic recent history and the fact that its leadership is notionally "communist." Our second contribution is to detail some of the more important aspects of this process. We provide two case studies which focus on the role of state-owned enterprises and decentralisation initiatives which demonstrate that, despite the frequently ad hoc and contingent nature of the developmental project and an absence of the sort of state capacity that distinguished the likes of Japan in its heyday, the Vietnamese government is overseeing economic development in creative and surprisingly effective ways.

Abstract: Assessing the policy analytical capacity (PAC) of governments has suffered in the past from the anecdotal nature of most studies, leading to different evaluations of specific analytical activities and of the overall competences and capacities of governments as a whole. What is needed to advance the field is a set of metrics that can generate insights into the capabilities of different units and how changes to their and overall government capacity develop over time. Focusing on this component of policy capacity, we map and measure the distribution of policy professionals in the provincial, territorial, and federal governments in Canada. Our measures are tested against two major findings regarding PAC: first that variation among governmental PAC varies by size of the civil service, with smaller jurisdictions likely to have less capacity, and second, that concentration of professionals in specific issue areas underscores that area's political and/or policy salience to the government concerned. Both measures prove robust in assessing Canadian government activities in these areas. Points for practitioners Policy capacity is acknowledged as a significant perquisite for policy success. While some general frameworks exist highlighting policy relevant competences and capabilities important to policy success, how to measure these remains under-investigated. Focusing on policy analytical capacity, this paper draws on the literature on policy professionals to develop two measures of this component of policy capacity linked to the extent to which an agency focuses on analysis and the proportion of their staff who work on the subject compared to other agencies. The measures are deployed in an illustrative case of Canada and Canadian governments at the territorial, provincial, and federal level which confirms their utility and robustness as indicators of the different levels of analytical capacity different agencies employ.

Abstract: If, as some have argued, private higher education is now the most dynamic segment of higher education, it is also the case that its growth, partly in response to the increasing mismatch between spiralling demand and limited state capacity, is often ad hoc. The article examines the contours of this trend in Indonesia, where the balance of public and private higher education has shifted sharply over the last two decades. While the private sector has been responsible for much of the expansion in higher education, its role in relation to quality is more questionable. Indonesia's economic burdens, sharply exacerbated by the effects of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, make it likely that the trend towards privatisation, including of its public institutions, will continue. Together with the current rise of trans-national higher education, however, this is only likely to sharpen existing difficulties around longstanding issues of quality, equality, and regulatory capacity.

Abstract: We study non-asymptotic fundamental limits for transmitting classical information over memoryless quantum channels, i.e. we investigate the amount of classical information that can be transmitted when a quantum channel is used a finite number of times and a fixed, non-vanishing average error is permissible. In this work we consider the classical capacity of quantum channels that are image-additive, including all classical to quantum channels, as well as the product state capacity of arbitrary quantum channels. In both cases we show that the non-asymptotic fundamental limit admits a second-order approximation that illustrates the speed at which the rate of optimal codes converges to the Holevo capacity as the blocklength tends to infinity. The behavior is governed by a new channel parameter, called channel dispersion, for which we provide a geometrical interpretation.

Abstract: How has social work, which has emerged as a distinct profession in the PRC with the full support of the party-state, come to produce neoliberal outcomes similar to those found in other, capitalist countries? In this article, I draw attention to the government purchase (goumai) of social work services, which is commonly considered as confirmation of state capacity and leadership rather than the passing on of state responsibilities to civil sectors with tight budgets. Ethnographic research on the actual social work practices in Shenzhen's Foxconn town reveals how neoliberal-style outsourcing has converged with diverse historical legacies, thus creating precarious labour conditions for frontline social workers. Neoliberal dynamics end up filling most of these social work positions with migrant youth from the countryside, reproducing and perpetuating China's rural-urban divide. Institutional efforts at social care may not only reduce the existing inequalities but may also rely upon and even reinforce them.

Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has imposed widespread negative impacts (economically, psychologically, neurologically, and societally), and has changed daily behaviors on a global scale. Such impacts are more significant and pervasive in countries with higher levels of inequality and reduced Government capacity and responsiveness, such as those in the Global South (e.g., Colombia). Differences in social and moral cognitive skills may significantly impact individual attitudes and responses to the pandemic. Here, we aimed to assess the extent to which factors associated with prosociality (including empathy, theory of mind (ToM), and moral judgments) predict the perception of SARS-CoV-2 impacts and responses. Participants (N = 413) from Colombia answered factors associated with prosociality measures and judgments about SARS-CoV-2 risk, impact, and acceptance of quarantine guidelines. Results revealed that affective empathy (personal distress and empathic concern) and moral tendencies (deontological trends) predicted greater acceptance of quarantine but in turn yielded an increased perception of risks and individual impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, age (older) and gender (female) also increased the risk perception and impact estimation. These results underscore the role of prosocial-related predispositions informing individual responses to the pandemic and provide an opportunity to exploit this knowledge to inform successful interventions favoring behavioral change.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Goals, challenges, and next steps in transdisciplinary fisheries research: perspectives and experiences from early-career researchers

Abstract: Fisheries are highly complex social-ecological systems that often face 'wicked' problems from unsustainable resource management to climate change. Addressing these challenges requires transdisciplinary approaches that integrate perspectives across scientific disciplines and knowledge systems. Despite widespread calls for transdisciplinary fisheries research (TFR), there are still limitations in personal and institutional capacity to conduct and support this work to the highest potential. The viewpoints of early career researchers (ECRs) in this field can illuminate challenges and promote systemic change within fisheries research. This paper presents the perspectives of ECRs from across the globe, gathered through a virtual workshop held during the 2021 World Fisheries Congress, on goals, challenges, and future potential for TFR. Big picture goals for TFR were guided by principles of co-production and included (i) integrating transdisciplinary thinking at all stages of the research process, (ii) ensuring that research is inclusive and equitable, (iii) co-creating knowledge that is credible, relevant, actionable, and impactful, and (iv) consistently communicating with partners. Institutional inertia, lack of recognition of the extra time and labour required for TFR, and lack of skill development opportunities were identified as three key barriers in conducting TFR. Several critical actions were identified to help ECRs, established researchers, and institutions reach these goals. We encourage ECRs to form peer-mentorship networks to guide each other along the way. We suggest that established researchers ensure consistent mentorship while also giving space to ECR voices. Actions for institutions include retooling education programs, developing and implementing new metrics of impact, and critically examining individualism and privilege in academia. We suggest that the opportunities and actions identified here, if widely embraced now, can enable research that addresses complex challenges facing fishery systems contributing to a healthier future for fish and humans alike.

Abstract: This article describes the outcomes of research into the potential of community-based mariculture of the commercial sea cucumber, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), as a sustainable livelihood in New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Around 5000 cultured juvenile sandfish were stocked in a 5-ha trial community sea ranch. The community agreed to protect the area from fishing until researchers collected technical data on sandfish performance. However, poaching of sandfish from the trial sea ranch occurred during the 2018 annual sea cucumber fishing season and no technical data were generated. Community attitudes and responses to the fishing season, the mariculture research activity and the failure of the trial sea ranch were investigated. Widespread community approval of the trial sea ranch and respect for the fishing prohibition were reported. However, it was found that poaching within the ranch escalated to extensive fishing because community-based management proved inadequate to sanction the poachers. Increased buying pressure and higher prices led to intensified fishing effort in the 2018 season. The trial sea ranch failed due to external pressures (i.e., brief, intense fishing season; limited project capacity), compounded by internal factors (i.e., weak local leadership; community disunity). It was concluded that research into and development of sandfish mariculture as a livelihood option in New Ireland Province might be impossible at this time due to the high value of sandfish, the annual sea cucumber fishing season, and ineffective governance at community, provincial and national levels. Lessons learned from this experience are presented and alternative models discussed.

Abstract: ObjectiveTo describe the mode and timing of delivery of twin pregnancies at 34weeks of gestation and their association with perinatal outcomes. DesignSecondary analysis of a cross-sectional study. PopulationTwin deliveries at 34weeks of gestation from 21 low- and middle-income countries participating in the WHO Multicountry Survey on Maternal and Newborn Health. MethodsDescriptive analysis and effect estimates using multilevel logistic regression. Main outcome measuresStillbirth, perinatal mortality, and neonatal near miss (use of selected life saving interventions at birth). ResultsThe average length of gestation at delivery was 37.6weeks. Of all twin deliveries, 16.8 and 17.6% were delivered by caesarean section before and after the onset of labour, respectively. Prelabour caesarean delivery was associated with older maternal age, higher institutional capacity and wealth of the country. Compared with spontaneous vaginal delivery, lower risks of neonatal near miss (adjusted odds ratio, aOR, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 0.44-0.94) were found among prelabour caesarean deliveries. A lower risk of early neonatal mortality (aOR0.12; 95% CI 0.02-0.56) was also observed among prelabour caesarean deliveries with nonvertex presentation of the first twin. The week of gestation with the lowest rate of prospective fetal death varied by fetal presentation: 37weeks for vertex-vertex; 39weeks for vertex-nonvertex; and 38weeks for a nonvertex first twin. ConclusionsThe prelabour caesarean delivery rate among twins varied largely between countries, probably as a result of overuse of caesarean delivery in wealthier countries and limited access to caesarean delivery in low-income countries. Prelabour delivery may be beneficial when the first twin is nonvertex. International guidelines for optimal twin delivery methods are needed.

Abstract: Context: In 1989, health insurance (HI) was introduced in Vietnam and began to be implemented in 1992. There was limited progress until the 2014 Law on HI that was revised with the aim of universal health insurance coverage (UHIC) by 2020. This article explores stakeholder roles and positions from the initial introduction of HI to the implementation of the Master Plan accelerating UHIC. Objective: To better understand the influence of stakeholders in accelerating UHIC to achieve equity in health care. Design: Using a qualitative study design, we conducted content analysis of HI-related documents and interviewed social security and health system key informants, government representatives, and community stakeholders to determine their positions and influence on UHIC. Results: Our findings demonstrate different levels of support of stakeholders that influence in the HI formulation and implementation, from opposition when HI was first introduced in 1989 to collaboration of stakeholders from 2013 when the Master Plan for UHIC was implemented. Despite an initial failure to secure the support of the Parliament for a Law on HI, a subsequent series of alternative legislative strategies brought limited increases in HI coverage. With government financial subsidization, the involvement of multiple stakeholders, political commitment, and flexible working mechanisms among stakeholders have remained important, with an increasing recognition that HI is not only a technical aspect of the health system but also a broader socioeconomic and governance issue. The different levels of power and influence among stakeholders, together with their commercial and political interests and their different perceptions of HI, have influenced stakeholders' support or opposition to HI policies. Conclusions: Despite high-level policy support, stakeholders' positions may vary, depending on their perceptions of the policy Implications. A shift in government stakeholder positions, especially at the provincial level, has been necessary to accelerate UHIC progress and build institutional capacity.

Abstract: Canadian immigration policies went through numerous changes under the Conservative party leadership of Stephen Harper from 2006 to 2015. This article provides an empirical account of immigration policy change during this era and suggests that of state-centred venue shopping can effectively account for the Harper's immigration record. In particular, it documents the ways in which immigration policies have expanded into international and regional venues, opened new venues to non-state actors, further decentralized into subnational venues and reinvested into traditional administrative and executive venues for policy making. The analysis suggests that the redeployment of the state into new and expanding venues aims to demonstrate state capacity and legitimacy as a nodal actor in immigration policy. ResumeCet article presente une analyse empirique des changements aux politiques liees a l'immigration effectuees par le gouvernement de Stephen Harper entre 2006 et 2015.

Abstract: In the West, limited government capacity to solve environmental problems has triggered the rise of a variety of "nonstate actors" to supplement government efforts or provide alternative mechanisms for addressing environmental issues. How does this development - along with our efforts to understand it map onto environmental governance processes in China? China's efforts to address environmental issues reflect institutionalized governance processes that differ from parallel western processes in ways that have major consequences for domestic environmental governance practices and the governance of China "going abroad." China's governance processes blur the distinction between the state and other actors; the "shadow of the state" is a major factor in all efforts to address environmental issues. The space occupied by nonstate actors in western systems is occupied by shiye danwei ("public service units"), she hui tuanti ("social associations") and e-platforms, all of which have close links to the state. Meanwhile, international NGOs and multinational corporations are also significant players in China. As a result, the mechanisms of influence that produce effects in China differ in important ways from mechanisms familiar from the western experience. This conclusion has far-reaching implications for those seeking to address global environmental concerns, given the importance of China's growing economy and burgeoning network of trade relationships.

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) put substantial stress on loco-regional resources, and trauma centers are critical to responding to these events. Our previous evaluation of Canadian centers helped to identify several weaknesses in disaster responsiveness. In this analysis, we determined the current state of MCI readiness across Canada and how this has changed over time. A multinational cross-sectional survey-based study on MCI preparedness was performed, including 24 Canadian trauma centers. Surveys were completed anonymously online by representatives of each facility. Responses from Canadian centers were examined and compared to previous findings to assess temporal changes in institutional capacity. Fifteen (63%) trauma centers responded, 100% of which had a disaster committee. Sixty percent had a single all-hazards emergency plan, and 71% performed a practice drill in the last two years. Sixty-two percent had communications systems designed to function during an MCI. Ninety-two percent had a triage system in place, and 54% of centers could monitor surge capacity. Half (54%) reported back-up systems for survival essentials, but the capability for prolonged operation during a disaster was limited. A minority (15%) had a database denoting staff with emergency training, although half (54%) had disaster training programs. Comparison to past data showed an increased prevalence of committees dedicated to disaster preparedness and disaster drills but worsened external stakeholder representation and poor ability to provide a prolonged response to crises. Our results demonstrate that MCI preparedness is a growing focus of Canadian trauma centers, but that there are deficiencies that remain unaddressed. Future efforts should focus on these vulnerabilities to ensure the provision of a robust disaster response.

Abstract: The very existence of the new state of Manchukuo was contested throughout the 1930s. Despite its colonial reality, its form as a nation-state necessitated an attempt to generate legitimacy, and its best hope lay in performance legitimacy as a modernizing and developmental state delivering public goods and offering honest and efficient government. Less than a year after its establishment, the new state faced a crisis caused by large-scale floods in the north of the region. This article examines how it attempted to build performance legitimacy even in a quasi-colonial situation by establishing institutions and raising funds to mount a relief effort, providing food, shelter, and medical care, and in the longer term restoring state capacity by maintaining order, reopening communications, and instituting flood prevention measures. At the same time, it generated a narrative that linked that effort to its broader ideological claims to legitimacy.

Abstract: Stresses associated with effects of climate change, including rise in relative mean sea level, present one set of threats to mangroves. Coastal development and ecosystems in the Pacific Islands region are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. We investigated the capacity of Pacific Island countries and territories to assess mangrove vulnerability to the effects of climate change, and their capacity to adapt to mangrove responses to these forces. Technical and institutional capacity-building priorities include: (1) strengthening management frameworks to conduct site-specific assessment of mangrove vulnerability and incorporate resulting information into land-use plans to prepare for any landward mangrove migration and offsetting anticipated losses; (2) reducing and eliminating stresses on and rehabilitating mangroves, in part, to increase mangrove resilience to climate change effects; and (3) augmenting abilities to establish mangrove baselines, and monitor gradual changes using standardized techniques through a regional network to distinguish local and climate change effects on mangroves. Other priorities are to: (4) assess how mangrove margins have changed over recent decades; (5) determine projections of trends in mean relative sea level and trends in the frequency and elevation of extreme high water events; (6) measure trends in changes in elevations of mangrove surfaces; and (7) incorporate this information into land-use planning processes. Also in (8) some locations require spatial imagery showing topography and locations of mangroves and coastal development. Land-use planners can use information from assessments predicting shoreline responses to projected sea level rise and other climate change effects to reduce risks to coastal development, human safety, and coastal ecosystems. This advanced planning enables coastal managers to minimize social disruption and cost, minimize losses of valued coastal ecosystems, and maximize available options.

Abstract: It is widely held in the public policy and political economy literatures that the Turkish state is weak and cannot adopt a proactive approach in the financial services industry by steering and coordinating the financial policy network. However, it is puzzling that this seemingly "weak" Turkish state, which is often marked by fragmentation, conflict, and a lack of policy coordination within the state apparatus, acted strongly between 2010 and 2016 by taking pre-emptive measures to contain the macrofinancial risks arising from hot money inflows and bank credit expansion. Examining the organizational policy capacity of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, this article argues that proactive policy design and implementation are more likely to complement state capacity when the principal bureaucratic actors have strong organizational policy capacities.

Abstract: This paper argues that despite Indonesia's implementation of public sector reforms, the impact of these reforms has yet to achieve the goal of improving governance and preventing corruption. The obvious place to lay blame would be a lack of state capacity, but this study presents evidence to argue that the legacy of General Suharto's authoritarian regime and the cultural ecology of Indonesian bureaucracy has compromised the government's capacity to implement these public sector reforms in a meaningful way. IMPACT This paper highlights some fundamental points for public policy-makers using NPM techniques to improve accountability and to counter fraud. First, the cultural context and costs of reforms should be taken into account before implementing new accounting technology. Second, policy-makers should consult academic work on the implementation of new reporting systems and other NPM policies. Finally, the powers of local politicians (for example mayors or district heads) need to be controlled to ensure they do not undermine the role of accounting and auditing for better transparency, governance and corruption eradication.

Abstract: A thorough understanding of livelihoods is necessary to ensure development policies are compatible with both resource conservation and the social and economic goals of development. Few studies, however, focus on value-adding activities occurring post-harvest in artisanal fisheries. The transformation of mollusc shells and skeletal remains of other marine taxa into artistic jewellery and decorative items is becoming an increasingly important livelihood activity for rural, coastal communities across the Pacific. We examine the potential challenges facing the shell-based handicraft sector and opportunities for overcoming these challenges using a quantitative study of artisans among the Tigak Islands of Papua New Guinea. The major challenges facing this livelihood sector are perceptions of marine resource declines and a lack of livelihood flexibility, attributed to the specialisation of material assets and skills. Improving market heterogeneity and developing coastal aquaculture may facilitate sustainable development of this livelihood sector.

Abstract: Healthcare workers involved in aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheal intubation, may be at elevated risk of acquiring COVID-19. However, the magnitude of this risk is unknown. We conducted a prospective international multicentre cohort study recruiting healthcare workers participating in tracheal intubation of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Information on tracheal intubation episodes, personal protective equipment use and subsequent provider health status was collected via self-reporting. The primary endpoint was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or new symptoms requiring self-isolation or hospitalisation after a tracheal intubation episode. Cox regression analysis examined associations between the primary endpoint and healthcare worker characteristics, procedure-related factors and personal protective equipment use. Between 23 March and 2 June 2020, 1718 healthcare workers from 503 hospitals in 17 countries reported 5148 tracheal intubation episodes. The overall incidence of the primary endpoint was 10.7% over a median (IQR [range]) follow-up of 32 (18-48 [0-116]) days. The cumulative incidence within 7, 14 and 21 days of the first tracheal intubation episode was 3.6%, 6.1% and 8.5%, respectively. The risk of the primary endpoint varied by country and was higher in women, but was not associated with other factors. Around 1 in 10 healthcare workers involved in tracheal intubation of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 subsequently reported a COVID-19 outcome. This has human resource implications for institutional capacity to deliver essential healthcare services, and wider societal implications for COVID-19 transmission.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Cyclic Capacity of Monopiles in Sand under Partially Drained Conditions: A Numerical Approach

Abstract: Cyclic loading of saturated sand under partially drained conditions may lead to accumulated strains, pore pressure buildup, and consequently reduced effective stress, stiffness, and shear strength. This will affect the ultimate limit state capacity of monopile foundations in sand for offshore wind turbines. This paper calculates the performance of large-diameter monopile foundations, which are installed in uniform dense sand, subjected to storm loading using the partially drained cyclic accumulation model (PDCAM). The simultaneous pore pressure accumulation and dissipation is accounted for by fully coupled pore water flow and stress equilibrium (consolidation) finite element analyses. Drainage and cyclic load effects on monopile behavior are studied by comparing the PDCAM simulation results with simulation results using a hardening soil model with small strain stiffness. At the end, a simplified procedure of PDCAM, named PDCAM-S, is proposed, and the results using this approach together with PLAXIS 3D and the NGI-ADP soil model are compared with the PDCAM results.

Abstract: The success of mariculture activities involving the release of cultured marine invertebrates into the ocean is contingent on high survival and appropriate growth rates. Physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics that differ from those of wild conspecifics may be acquired through hatchery rearing, or as a result of stress induced by the release process. Such differences may compromise the 'fitness' of cultured animals. We investigated the influence of hatchery rearing and transport/handling stress on a commercial sea cucumber, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), by comparing survival, growth and behavior of release-size (5-15 g) cultured juveniles to those of like-size wild conspecifics. At the conclusion of an 85-day growth experiment in natural habitat, there was no significant difference in weight between cultured and wild sandfish juveniles. Burying behavior of cultured and wild sandfish juveniles was observed over a 48-h period in natural habitat with or without seagrass. A generalized additive model showed that cultured juveniles were slower to bury in the substrate after release, less likely to be buried at most times, and more likely to be buried in substrate where seagrass was present. However, they became better synchronized with their wild counterparts after 30 h. Survival of cultured and wild sandfish was high in both experiments (> 85%), but reduced burying by cultured individuals may increase the potential for predation because diel burying is the main predator avoidance strategy of sandfish juveniles.

Abstract: The implementation of international law requires State capacity, including knowledge of treaties and institutions by domestic officials. The training of State officials is often delivered by an international organisation, agency or secretariat as part of the capacity-building programmes required by the treaty that each administers. Yet, of the increasingly urgent calls for international cooperation to address climate change, biodiversity crises, public health threats and plastic pollution, among other issues, not one can be addressed by a single treaty or international organisation. The practical, operational and theoretical challenges of coordination deserve more attention by international lawyers. This is especially important given the development of pandemic-era remote learning technologies and the proliferation of e-learning opportunities. Disparities in resources, and the categorisation of developing and developed countries, further complicates the production and dissemination of knowledge. This article focuses on capacity-building, technical assistance and training, and includes the author's experience with collaborative training initiatives in ocean governance, to which United Nations agencies, the World Bank and academic partners contribute. The article describes the high stakes of integrative initiatives, the outreach by international organisations and the interaction between regimes. It seeks to account for collaborative capacity-building activities and the adaptive role of participants within the system of international law.

Abstract: A case study report of the good practices of the Sri Lankan Early Warning System (EWS) was prepared for the ANDROID Disaster Resilience Network funded by the EU Lifelong Learning Programme. The objective was to highlight good practices, identify gaps and useful recommendations (within an up-to-date and comprehensive context) to achieve disaster resilient governance. The EWS components; Infrastructure, Risk Knowledge (i.e. Hazard, Vulnerability and Risk Assessment), Preparedness and Early Warning Dissemination, Disaster Response and Coordination were scrutinised. These components were compared against the exemplary structure of a people-centred EWS to assess its efficacy in achieving disaster resilience. Since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami was the first contemporary large-scale disaster faced by Sri Lanka, it lacked the legislative framework and institutional capacity to respond and only thereafter the integration of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) was observed. The importance of training was demonstrated within risk knowledge, preparedness and early warning dissemination, and disaster response and coordination. Thereby training is considered crucial in achieving a progressive, people-centred EWS. However it can be consolidated through joint resource utilisation (particularly personnel) between organisations and creating a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) certification system. There has been considerable progress in integrating DRR into development at all levels, which is a key measure in achieving disaster resilience. It was notably observed in achieving disaster resilient development, climate change adaptation and DRR was integrated despite a general tendency to be polarised in other areas. Despite some existing projects there is a need for greater government and private sector engagement in ecosystem-based DRR. Finally to achieve a disaster resilient Sri Lankan EWS, risk transfer measures require further evaluation. The emergence of some disaster risk financing and insurance is observed but issues, such as assuring applicability to a local context and scientific, evidence-based underpinning, need to be addressed.

We argue that rice cultivation is associated with the adoption of a collectivist culture, which in turn fosters greater conformity pressures on political norms and deters democratization. Conversely, a wheat farming legacy leads to the development of individualism, which in turn promotes democracy. Using the rice-wheat suitability ratio for a sample of 146 countries as an exogenous variable for rice farming culture, we find that the rice-wheat suitability ratio is a deep-rooted determinant for the formation of democratic institutions through a culture of collectivism vs. individualism.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Excess Mortality and its Determinants During the COVID-19 Pandemic in 21 Countries: An Ecological Study from the C-MOR Project, 2020 and 2021

Abstract: IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed health systems, resulting in a surge in excess deaths. This study clustered countries based on excess mortality to understand their response to the pandemic and the influence of various factors on excess mortality within each cluster.Materials and MethodsThis ecological study is part of the COVID-19 MORtality (C-MOR) Consortium. Mortality data were gathered from 21 countries and were previously used to calculate weekly all-cause excess mortality. Thirty exposure variables were considered in five categories as factors potentially associated with excess mortality: population factors, health care resources, socioeconomic factors, air pollution, and COVID-19 policy. Estimation of Latent Class Linear Mixed Model (LCMM) was used to cluster countries based on response trajectory and Generalized Linear Mixture Model (GLMM) for each cluster was run separately.ResultsUsing LCMM, two clusters were reached. Among 21 countries, Brazil, the USA, Georgia, and Poland were assigned to a separate cluster, with the mean of excess mortality z-score in 2020 and 2021 around 4.4, compared to 1.5 for all other countries assigned to the second cluster. In both clusters the population incidence of COVID-19 had the greatest positive relationship with excess mortality while interactions between the incidence of COVID-19, fully vaccinated people, and stringency index were negatively associated with excess mortality. Moreover, governmental variables (government revenue and government effectiveness) were the most protective against excess mortality.ConclusionThis study highlighted that clustering countries based on excess mortality can provide insights to gain a broader understanding of countries' responses to the pandemic and their effectiveness.

Abstract: We examine the effect of sectarian politics in the presence of weak state capacity on long-term economic growth. To this end, we exploit the 1956 civil uprising between Maronite Christian and Sunni Muslim factions in Lebanon to estimate the impact of sectarian political tensions on long-term growth. To isolate the impact of the uprising, we use synthetic control estimator and match Lebanon's pre-1956 growth and development trajectory with the rest of the world where such uprising did not occur, and estimate the counterfactual growth trajectory in the hypothetical absence of the sectarian conflict. Our evidence indicates large and pervasive negative growth effects of factionalism. Our estimates imply that Lebanon's per capita income down to the present day is on average 57% lower than that of its pre-1956 synthetic control group without sectarian clashes, and does not seem to be driven by preexisting or subsequent trends and shocks. The negative long-term growth effect of sectarian conflict is robust to a battery of spatial and temporal placebo checks, choice of samples and is not sensitive to the composition of control groups.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: A qualitative study of governance of evolving response to non-communicable diseases in low-and middle- income countries: current status, risks and options

Abstract: Background: Segmented service delivery with consequent inefficiencies in health systems was one of the main concerns raised during scaling up of disease-specific programs in the last two decades. The organized response to NCD is in infancy in most LMICs with little evidence on how the response is evolving in terms of institutional arrangements and policy development processes. Methods: Drawing on qualitative review of policy and program documents from five LMICs and data from global key-informant surveys conducted in 2004 and 2010, we examine current status of governance of response to NCDs at national level along three dimensions-institutional arrangements for stewardship and program management and implementation; policies/plans; and multisectoral coordination and partnerships. Results: Several positive trends were noted in the organization and governance of response to NCDs: shift from specific NCD-based programs to integrated NCD programs, increasing inclusion of NCDs in sector-wide health plans, and establishment of high-level multisectoral coordination mechanisms. Several areas of concern were identified. The evolving NCD-specific institutional structures are being treated as 'program management and implementation' entities rather than as lead 'technical advisory' bodies, with unclear division of roles and responsibilities between NCD-specific and sector-wide structures. NCD-specific and sector-wide plans are poorly aligned and lack prioritization, costing, and appropriate targets. Finally, the effectiveness of existing multisectoral coordination mechanisms remains questionable. Conclusions: The 'technical functions' and 'implementation and management functions' should be clearly separated between NCD-specific units and sector-wide institutional structures to avoid duplicative segmented service delivery systems. Institutional capacity building efforts for NCDs should target both NCD-specific units (for building technical and analytical capacity) and sector-wide organizational units (for building program management and implementation capacity) in MOH. The sector-wide health plans should reflect NCDs in proportion to their public health importance. NCD specific plans should be developed in close consultation with sector-wide health- and non-health stakeholders. These plans should expand on the directions provided by sector-wide health plans specifying strategically prioritized, fully costed activities, and realistic quantifiable targets for NCD control linked with sector-wide expenditure framework. Multisectoral coordination mechanisms need to be strengthened with optimal decision-making powers and resource commitment and monitoring of their outputs.

Abstract: This paper describes a method of the refined plastic hinge approach in the framework of the higher-order element formulation that can efficaciously evaluate the limit state capacity of a whole reinforced concrete structural system using least number of element(s), whereas the traditional design of a reinforced concrete structure (i.e. AS3600; Eurocode 2) is member-based approach. Hence, in regard to the material nonlinearities, the efficient and economical cross-section analysis is provided to evaluate the element section capacity of non-uniform and arbitrary concrete section subjected to the interaction effects, which is helpful to formulate the refined plastic hinge method. In regard to the geometric nonlinearities, this paper relies on the higher-order element formulation with element load effect. Eventually, the load redistribution can be considered and make full use of the strength reserved owing to the redundancy of an indeterminate structure. And it is particularly true for the performance-based design of a structure under the extreme loads, while the uncertainty of the extreme load is great that the true behaviour of a whole structural system is important for the economical design approach, which is great superiority over the conservative optimal strength of an individual and isolated member based on traditional design (i.e. AS3600; Eurocode 2).

Abstract: Over the years, the chemical market has shown significant growth, but the hazardous impact of chemical use and disposal on the environment and human health is a growing concern. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are among the most dangerous chemicals with widespread effects on the environment and living organisms, including humans. This study aimed to assess the current status of POP management and regulatory infrastructure in Ethiopia by collecting information from stakeholders responsible for recording the import, export, use, management, and regulation of POPs both in government and private sectors. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review was conducted using Boolean operators from international databases and libraries. The results indicated that Ethiopia banned the import of pesticides listed under Annex A (i.e., those to be eliminated), except endosulfan, which was imported at a quantity of 199,767 kg lt(-1) from 2011 to 2015. There are 2,435 PCB-containing transformers in Ethiopia, of which 2,242 (92%) are currently in use. These transformers and capacitors contain 1,031,661 kg and 1,255 kg of dielectric fluids, respectively. As for Annex B POPs (i.e., those to be restricted), there are between 928,509 kg and 1,383,095 kg of active and obsolete dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane found in different stores across the country. Ethiopia imported approximately 337,000 kg of products containing perfluorooctane sulfonic acid from 2000 to 2020, with an annual average of 16,850 kg of photographic film, paper, and plates. POPs were also detected in different environmental matrices (soil, waterbodies, sediments, food items, and air) as well as human blood. Despite these findings, regulation and management of POP waste and stockpiles are largely inadequate in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the monitoring, management, and regulation of POPs in the country. This could be achieved by strengthening the collaboration among different regulatory bodies, harmonizing the fragmented laws on POP management and control, and building institutional capacity.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Assessing the Cost of Global Biodiversity and Conservation Knowledge

Abstract: Knowledge products comprise assessments of authoritative information supported by standards, governance, quality control, data, tools, and capacity building mechanisms. Considerable resources are dedicated to developing and maintaining knowledge products for biodiversity conservation, and they are widely used to inform policy and advise decision makers and practitioners. However, the financial cost of delivering this information is largely undocumented. We evaluated the costs and funding sources for developing and maintaining four global biodiversity and conservation knowledge products: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, Protected Planet, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. These are secondary data sets, built on primary data collected by extensive networks of expert contributors worldwide. We estimate that US$160 million (range: US$116-204 million), plus 293 person-years of volunteer time (range: 278308 person-years) valued at US$14 million (range US$12-16 million), were invested in these four knowledge products between 1979 and 2013. More than half of this financing was provided through philanthropy, and nearly three-quarters was spent on personnel costs. The estimated annual cost of maintaining data and platforms for three of these knowledge products (excluding the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems for which annual costs were not possible to estimate for 2013) is US$6.5 million in total (range: US$6.2-6.7 million). We estimated that an additional US$114 million will be needed to reach pre-defined baselines of data coverage for all the four knowledge products, and that once achieved, annual maintenance costs will be approximately US$12 million. These costs are much lower than those to maintain many other, similarly important, global knowledge products. Ensuring that biodiversity and conservation knowledge products are sufficiently up to date, comprehensive and accurate is fundamental to inform decision-making for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Thus, the development and implementation of plans for sustainable long-term financing for them is critical.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Socioeconomic impacts of a sea cucumber fishery in Papua New Guinea: Is there an opportunity for mariculture?

Abstract: Small-scale fisheries provide many benefits to coastal communities in the Indo-Pacific region, including food security, improved nutrition and cash income. However, increasing engagement with the global economy is exerting additional pressure on marine resources and opportunities to engage in alternative livelihoods are often limited by remoteness and a lack of land-based farming opportunities. Beche-de-mer, the dried body wall of sea cucumber, is a valuable marine export commodity in the region, and an important cash-earning activity in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Sea cucumber mariculture (or holothuriculture), based on the high-value species, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), is also a promising community livelihood. Overfishing of sea cucumber in PNG led the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) to impose a moratorium on the fishery in October 2009. The fishery was reopened in 2017 for less than two months. This article presents socioeconomic data generated before, during and after the 2017 sea cucumber fishing season in three villages in New Ireland Province, PNG, which are also partners in a community-based sandfish mariculture project. The fishery dominated the economies of all three communities while it was open. Increased income was accompanied by high consumption of store-bought foods and purchase of other assets intended to increase living standards. Drawing on current understandings of local culture and political economy, together with the results from the 2017 wild sea cucumber fishery, we discuss how a livelihood based on holothuriculture could coexist with the wild fishery to increase benefits to coastal communities in PNG.

Abstract: This paper reports methodology for large-scale hatchery culture of sandfish, Holothuria scabra, in the absence of live, cultured micro-algae. We demonstrate how commercially-available micro-algae concentrates can be incorporated into hatchery protocols as the sole larval food source to completely replace live, cultured microalgae. Micro-algae concentrates supported comparable hatchery production of sandfish to that of live, cultured micro-algae traditionally used in large-scale hatchery culture. The hatchery protocol presented allowed a single technician to achieve production of more than 18,800 juvenile sandfish at 40 days post-fertilisation in a low-resource hatchery in Papua New Guinea. Growth of auricularia larvae fed micro-algae concentrates was represented by the equation length (mu m) = 307.8 x ln(day) + 209.2 (R-2 = 0.93) while survival over the entire 40 day hatchery cycle was described by the equation survival = 2 x day(-1.06) (R-2 = 0.74). These results show that micro-algae concentrates have great potential for simplifying hatchery culture of sea cucumbers by reducing infrastructural and technical resources required for live micro-algae culture. The hatchery methodology described in this study is likely to have applicability to low-resource hatcheries throughout the Indo-Pacific and could support regional expansion of sandfish hatchery production.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Vaccine vial monitor availability and use in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review

Abstract: Introduction: The vaccine vial monitor (VVM) registers cumulative heat exposure on vaccines over time. As low- and lower-middle-income countries transition beyond support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), they will assume full responsibility for vaccine financing and procurement. It is unclear to what extent countries transitioning out of Gavi support will continue to include VVMs on their vaccines. This paper aims to systematically review evidence on WM availability and use in low- and middle-income countries to document factors behind global access to and country demand for VVMs. Such results could help identify actions needed to ensure continued use of VVMs in countries that transition out of Gavi support. Methods: We performed a systematic review of electronic databases, reference lists, and grey literature in English and French languages with publication dates from 2005 onwards. The studies included were analyzed for the following outcomes: (1) availability and deployment of VVM-labeled vaccines; (2) WM practices and perceptions in the immunization system; (3) vaccine introduction and decision-making processes; (4) Gavi graduation and vaccine program sustainability. Results: The study found that VVM availability and use was affected by multiple sourcing of vaccines and the extent to which WM was included in the vaccine specification in the tendering documents when procuring vaccines. Knowledge about VVM and its impact on the EPI program was found to be high among health workers as well as decision-makers. However, the study also found that weak capacity in key national institutions such as NRA and NPA might impact on demand for WM. As countries take decisions regarding the adoption of new vaccines, factors such as disease burden and vaccine price may assume greater importance than vaccine characteristics and presentation. Finally, the study found that countries rely largely on the advice and recommendations from technical partners such as WHO and PAHO. Conclusion: The study concludes that global access to and country demand for VVM are dependent on policy statements and recommendations about VVM by key policy institutions such as WHO and UNICEF. The study also concludes that despite Gavi-eligible countries having access to WM-labeled vaccines, inclusion is often below 100%. Weak institutional capacity in key national agencies such as NRA and NPA seems to be a contributing factor, while other factors include the procurement of clear national policies on the inclusion of VVM on vaccines, along with the capacity to enforce the policy. Finally, the study concludes that knowledge about VVM and its impact on vaccine program efficiency, safety, and cost is critical for transitioning countries' continuous demand for WM.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Lessons from the Viral Body Politic: Borders and the Possibilities of a More-than-Human Worldmaking

Abstract: Bordering practices have been a central and controversial feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Closed borders, lockdowns, and restrictions on movement and individual "freedoms" have revived concepts of the biopolitical "state of exception" and state control. In this article, we argue that biopolitical critiques of responses to the pandemic fail to grasp the opportunity to rethink worldmaking and instead base their critiques on a desired "return to normal" which foregrounds human-centric individualism at the expense of alternative worldmaking that accounts for the more-than-human. To do so, we bring the virus and the virome into our discussion to rethink bordering practices and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects bodies, worlds, and politics. We focus primarily on the Australian case, where the pandemic response began with lockdowns and then gave way to a militarized and individualistic approach. Responses to the pandemic have failed to produce a reimagining of human and more-than-human relations. Opportunities for ethical engagement have been missed, resulting in limited responses that stem from the failure of state capacity and entrenched modes of inequality that are harmful to vulnerable others, both human and more-than-human. This requires an ontological reframing of how we relate to a complex world from a more-than-human perspective. Les pratiques relatives aux frontieres constituaient une caracteristique decisive mais controversee de la pandemie de SARS-CoV-2. La fermeture des frontieres, les confinements et les restrictions des mouvements et des << libertes individuelles >> ont fait renaitre les concepts d'<< etat d'exception >> biopolitique et de controle de l'etat. Dans cet article, nous affirmons que les critiques biopolitiques des mesures liees a la pandemie ne saisissent pas l'opportunite de repenser la conception du monde, et fondent davantage leurs critiques sur le << retour a la normale >> souhaite, qui met en avant l'individualisme anthropocentrique, plutot qu'une autre conception du monde qui prendrait en compte le plus qu'humain. Pour ce faire, nous introduisons le virus et le virome dans notre discussion pour repenser les pratiques relatives aux frontieres et les effets du virus SARS-CoV-2 sur les corps, les mondes et la politique. Nous nous concentrons principalement sur le cas australien, ou la reponse a la pandemie a debute par des confinements, puis a laisse place a une approche militarisee et individualiste. Les mesures prises pendant la pandemie n'ont pas reimagine les relations humaines et plus qu'humaines. Nous avons manque les opportunites d'engagement ethique, ce qui a limite nos reponses a cause de l'incapacite des etats et des modes d'inegalites tenaces, nocifs pour les autres vulnerables, tant humains que plus qu'humains. Aussi est-il necessaire de resituer sur le plan ontologique notre relation a un monde complexe d'apres une perspective plus qu'humaines. Las practicas fronterizas han sido una caracteristica importante y controvertida de la pandemia de SARS-CoV-2. Los cierres de fronteras, los confinamientos y las restricciones a la circulacion y a las << libertades >> individuales han revivido los conceptos del << estado de excepcion >> biopolitico y el control estatal. En este articulo argumentamos que las criticas biopoliticas a las respuestas contra la pandemia no aprovechan la oportunidad de repensar la construccion del mundo y, en cambio, basan sus criticas en un deseado << retorno a la normalidad >> que pone en primer plano el individualismo centrado en el ser humano a expensas de la creacion de mundos alternativos que tienen en cuenta mas de lo que es el ser humano. Para ello, utilizamos tanto el virus como el viroma en nuestra discusion con el fin de repensar las practicas fronterizas y como el virus SARS-CoV-2 afecta a los organismos, a los mundos y a la politica. Nos centramos principalmente en el caso australiano, donde la respuesta a la pandemia comenzo con confinamientos y, a continuacion, dio paso a un enfoque militarizado e individualista. Las respuestas a la pandemia no han logrado producir una reinvencion de las relaciones humanas y mas que humanas. En consecuencia, se han perdido oportunidades para lograr un compromiso etico, lo que ha dado lugar a respuestas limitadas que se derivan del fracaso de la capacidad del Estado y de modos arraigados de desigualdad que son perjudiciales para otros seres vulnerables, tanto humanos como mas que humanos. Esto requiere un replanteamiento ontologico de como nos relacionamos con un mundo complejo desde una perspectiva mas que humana.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Exploring the Scope of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome Therapy and Care: Engagement of Non-Critical Care Providers and Survivors in a Second Stakeholders Meeting

Abstract: Background: Increasing numbers of survivors of critical illness are at risk for physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that may persist for months or years after hospital discharge. The post-intensive care syndrome framework encompassing these multidimensional morbidities was developed at the 2010 Society of Critical Care Medicine conference on improving long-term outcomes after critical illness for survivors and their families. Objectives: To report on engagement with non-critical care providers and survivors during the 2012 Society of Critical Care Medicine post-intensive care syndrome stakeholder conference. Task groups developed strategies and resources required for raising awareness and education, understanding and addressing barriers to clinical practice, and identifying research gaps and resources, aimed at improving patient and family outcomes. Participants: Representatives from 21 professional associations or health systems involved in the provision of both critical care and rehabilitation of ICU survivors in the United States and ICU survivors and family members. Design: Stakeholder consensus meeting. Researchers presented summaries on morbidities for survivors and their families, whereas survivors presented their own experiences. Meeting Outcomes: Future steps were planned regarding 1) recognizing, preventing, and treating post-intensive care syndrome, 2) building strategies for institutional capacity to support and partner with survivors and families, and 3) understanding and addressing barriers to practice. There was recognition of the need for systematic and frequent assessment for post-intensive care syndrome across the continuum of care, including explicit "functional reconciliation" (assessing gaps between a patient's pre-ICU and current functional ability at all intra- and interinstitutional transitions of care). Future post-intensive care syndrome research topic areas were identified across the continuum of recovery: characterization of at-risk patients (including recognizing risk factors, mechanisms of injury, and optimal screening instruments), prevention and treatment interventions, and outcomes research for patients and families. Conclusions: Raising awareness of post-intensive care syndrome for the public and both critical care and non-critical care clinicians will inform a more coordinated approach to treatment and support during recovery after critical illness. Continued conceptual development and engagement with additional stakeholders is required.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Typhoon disaster politics in pre-1945 Asia: three case studies

Abstract: Purpose This paper focuses on the adaptations societies make to climate-related disasters. How they learnt from them in the past should indicate how they will respond in the more climate-stressed future. National typhoon disaster politics arise when citizens demand disaster protection from their state. Design/methodology/approach The paper analyzes one episode of typhoon politics in each of three Asian countries before 1945: the Philippines (1928), India (1942) and Japan (1934). These three countries show high variance in state capacity and level of democracy. Discourse data are found in contemporary newspaper accounts. Findings In each case, the typhoon disaster politics were shaped by the "distance" (geographical, institutional, class and cultural) between citizen-victims and the state. Where that distance was great (rural Philippines, Bengal-India), the state tended to minimise victimhood. Where it was small (urban Japan), adaptation was serious and rapid. Social implications The findings should stimulate public discussion of the way in which past social relations and power dynamics surrounding climate-related disasters might influence the present. As the political character of climate change adaptation grows clearer, so does the need for debate to be well-informed. Originality/value Most historical work on climate-related disasters has focused either on the natural phenomena, or on their societal impact. The present paper's focus on adaptation is part of a small but growing scholarly effort to bend the debate towards the evolution of adaptive capacity.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Does Selective Mechanisation Make up for Labour Shortages in Rural Myanmar?

Abstract: In Myanmar's rural areas, a high proportion of the landless population is traditionally linked with landholders as farm labour. More recently, however, these linkages seem to be unravelling due to the emergence of new industries and increased urbanisation creating new opportunities outside of the agricultural sector. While agricultural development schemes encourage intensified agricultural production and mechanization, labour shortages increasingly arise at peak cropping periods. Landholders respond with farm mechanization that reduces labour requirement. Based on household surveys and focus group discussions in the Ayeyarwady Delta (AD) and Central Dry Zone (CDZ) regions of Myanmar, this paper examines the extent of labour shortages in crop production and the efficiency of farm mechanization in response to labour shortfalls. Data show that only a small percentage of landless households in either region rely on agricultural labour alone. Instead we can observe a shift towards more diverse livelihood portfolios and non-farm work. This trend further amplifies labour shortages and leads to production loss. Most farm machines, however, substitute animal power but cannot replace human labour sufficiently to make up for the shortages. Moreover, landholders suffer from the inadequate quality of farm machines and high maintenance cost. The paper highlights farm labour shortage as a result of non-farm development and argues that farm mechanisation projects are ineffective without concomitant infrastructure and services development.

Abstract: Introduction Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and disability are major global health issues. Although they can cause and influence each other, data on their co-existence are sparse. We aimed to describe the prevalence and patterns of disability among a cohort of children with SAM. Methods A longitudinal cohort study in Malawi followed SAM survivors up to 7 years postdischarge. Clinical and anthropometric profiles were compared with sibling and community controls. Disability at original admission was identified clinically; at 7-year follow-up a standardised screening tool called 'the Washington Group Questionnaire' was used. Results 60/938 (6.4%) of admissions to SAM treatment had clinically obvious disability at admission. Post-treatment mortality was high, with only 11/60 (18%) surviving till 7-year follow-up. SAM children with a disability at admission had 6.99 (95% CI 3.49 to 14.02; p<0.001) greater risk of dying compared with children without disability. They were also older, less likely to be HIV positive or have oedema and more severely malnourished. Long-term survivors were more stunted, had less catch-up growth, smaller head circumference, weaker hand grip strength and poorer school achievement than non-disabled survivors. The Washington Group Questionnaire confirmed disability in all who had been identified clinically, and identified many who had not been previously flagged. Conclusion Disability is common among children affected by SAM. Those with disability-associated SAM have greatly increased risk of dying even if they survive the initial episode of malnutrition. Survivors have poorer growth, physical strength and school achievement. To enable all children to survive and thrive post-SAM, it is vital to focus more on those with disabilities. SAM treatment programmes should consider using not just clinical assessment but structured assessments to better identify at-risk individuals as well as understand the population of children for which they are developing services.

Abstract: Background: In most societies the health marketplace is pluralistic in character, with a mix of formal and informal providers. In high-income countries, state regulation of the market helps ensure quality and access and mitigate market failures. In the present study, using Haiti as a case study, we explore what happens to the functioning of the pluralistic health marketplace in severely disrupted environments where the informal sector is able to flourish. Methods: The overall research design was qualitative. Research methods included an extensive documentary and policy analysis, based on peer-reviewed articles, books and "grey" literature-government policy and program reports, unpublished research and evaluations, reviews and reviews from key multilateral and bilateral donors, and non-government organisations, combined with field site visits and in-depth key informant interviews (N = 45). Results: The findings show that state fragility has resulted in a privatised, commoditised and largely unregulated and informal health market. While different market segments can be identified, in reality the boundaries between international/domestic, public/private, for profit/not-for-profit, legal/illegal are hazy and shifting. Discussion: The lack of state capacity to provide an enabling environment, establish, and enforce its regulatory framework has resulted in a highly segmented, heterogeneous and informal health market. The result is deplorable health indices which are far below regional averages and many other low-income countries. Conclusions: Working in fragile states with limited capacity to undertake the core function of securing the health of its population requires new and innovative ways of working. This needs longer time-frames, combining incremental top-down and bottom-up strategies which recognize and work with state and civil society, public and private actors, formal and informal institutions, and progressively facilitate changes in the different market functions of supply, demand, regulation and supporting functions.

Abstract: Groundwater, which is the main source of water for human consumption in many rural areas, has its quality determined by the complex interaction of environmental factors and anthropogenic activities. The present study evaluated the quality of shallow groundwater (1 to 25 m depth) in the rural area of the Targoviste Plain, a densely populated area (200 inhabitants/km(2)) using 80 water samples collected from public wells. In order to explain the spatial distribution of the concentrations of the 19 physicochemical parameters considered (including heavy metals), the evaluation of groundwater quality for human consumption and potential impact on human health was conducted using the Water Quality Index (WQI), Integrated Weight Water Quality Index (IwWQI), Total Hazard Index (THI), and cumulative carcinogenic risk (CCR). For the WQI/IwWQI the comparative analysis of the two indices showed that for the WQI, it is important to select an optimal set of parameters, because use of a large number of physicochemical parameters can eclipse the values that exceed WHO guideline limits. In contrast, the use of entropy in the calculation of the IwWQI did not lead to eclipsing of exceedance, no matter the number of parameters used. Areas with poor and very poor groundwater quality according to the WQI/IwWQI overlapped, with a moderate risk to human health (THI > 1) for noncarcinogenic contaminants and also a risk of developing cancer according to the CCR average value (1.15 x 10(-2)). The health of 43% of the rural population in the Targoviste Plain can be affected if they drink contaminated groundwater, and it is estimated that about 600 people can develop cancer during their lifetime. If the risk of developing cancer is reduced only in the rural population that does not have access to a water source from a centralized and verified network, the results suggest that 385 people (1.15%) can develop cancer as a result of consuming groundwater contaminated with heavy metals based on the average value of CCR. This value is lower than the general mortality rate in areas with high CCR and below the average number of cancer patients in Romania (2.65%). The quality of groundwater and the risk of developing diseases and cancer due to water consumption is directly proportional to the intensity of agricultural land use and inversely proportional to the depth of the groundwater layer, the distance from the main hydrographic network and the reservoirs, and the distance from the main city, Targoviste. The complex and integrated analysis of groundwater quality using quality indices and indicators of health risk for the population, validated by hot-spot analysis and compared to the mortality rate, is an approach with practical applicability. This integrated approach allows public authorities, policymakers, and health services to implement an efficient monitoring program and optimize anthropogenic activities in order to prevent groundwater contamination and finally improve the quality of life for the residents in the area of this study.

Abstract: The work of Gerry Stoker and Colin Hay considers the alliance between neoliberalism and public choice theory to be the motor of anti-politics and depoliticization in contemporary Western societies. Their effects have been to hollow out strong statecraft and hard state capacity, as well as the thick collective capacities for representation, participation and deliberation crucial to keeping democratic government responsive, effective and accountable to the common will. On this view, all new forms of connective action are ipso facto rejected as the spawn of neoliberalism: They appear as individualistic and preventing the much needed repoliticizations that can bring the old, strong combination of hard state power and thickly integrated citizenship back in. I do not think this type of politicization strategy will work. There are good reasons why it has fizzled out over time. New forms of political participation and social movements indicate a need for reconnecting political authorities and laypeople on the output side as a form of alternative political problematization strategy. Hay and Stoker want to mobilize citizens for repoliticizing latent or hidden interest and identity conflicts on the input side. By contrast, these new actors insist that it is more important to problematize how policy risks and problems are handled by a network of globally interconnected policy elites from the public, private and even voluntary domains. The challenge for democratic political analysis today is to avoid placing politicization before problematization or vice versa. This requires a new model which does not identify politics with inputs and thereby relegates outputs to the domain of technical, non-political administration and management. Connective action, I argue, manifests a new model for problematizing how policies are authoritatively articulated, performed, delivered and evaluated for the populations. In dismissing it a priori as individualistic and depoliticizing, Hay and Stoker ignore how the new participants and movements provide a new way of problematizing and combating neoliberalism in theory as well as in practice.

Abstract: This article examines the effect of local political settlements on education policies in a decentralised political system. Under what conditions does decentralisation promote learning-enhancing policies? Despite the numerous works on decentralisation and education, little is known about how local politics influences student learning. We develop a novel approach to the politics of education policies by looking at the effect of local political settlements on education policymaking. Using a heuristic case study method comparing three districts in Indonesia, we found that constraints on the discretionary power of the district head over employment decisions in the bureaucracy matter for the development of learning-enhancing policies. Such a constraint can pave the way for the development of the bureaucratic capacity required for local governments to pursue quality-promoting reforms. In the absence of such a constraint, the extent to which district governments will implement learning-enhancing policies depends on district heads' commitment to learning.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Corporate power in the forests of the Solomon Islands

Abstract: IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 1990s, Malaysian investors, backed by Japanese and Korean buyers, pushed log production in the Solomon Islands to more than three times higher than the estimated sustainable level. Japanese log purchases alone in 1995 and 1996 were greater than the sustainable yield in the Solomon Islands. If log production had continued to escalate at the mid-1990s rate, these aggressive investors and traders would have depleted the Solomon Islands of commercial trees in less than a decade. The crash in demand for tropical logs following the 1997-98 economic downturn in Asia has slowed this looming environmental catastrophe. Although this could well be a temporary respite, this does provide the government of Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, which took power in August 1997, an opportunity to reform timber management. This paper examines the most important issue and the greatest obstacle facing reformers: the environmental and economic impact of multinational companies on natural forest management.(1) Cheap forest resources that externalize environmental and social costs lure investors and traders, even into areas with little infrastructure. Once there, these corporations generally harvest logs as quickly and cheaply as possible. Logically, they do not function within the bounds of formal laws or policies but rather within the bounds of state and societal rules that are actually enforced, persistently trying to bend these rules in their favour. They strain state capacity to manage forest resources, pressure and entice state officials to develop policies that maximize corporate profits, construct complex corporate structures that reduce accountability and transparency, and evade taxes and timber royalties. Corporations also generate financial incentives that stimulate unsustainable production, harvest concessions illegally and destructively, break or distort obligations to communities and landowners, make informal deals that lower export prices, and construct trade chains that depress consumer prices and stimulate wasteful consumption. These practices seem to suggest that corporations in the Solomon Islands are mischievous or devious resource exploiters. In some ways they are. But often they are rationally responding to market signals, the viability, profitability and uncertainty of operations, and the extent of state and societal controls. The paper begins with a brief discussion of the theoretical literature on the environmental impact on natural resources of multinational corporations. The second section provides essential background on commercial forest resources, environmental policies and forest institutions in the Solomon Islands. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth sections examine the actual impact of these policies and institutions on the behaviour of multinational investors. The seventh section analyzes the effect of corporate buyers. The conclusion reflects on the importance of the findings in the Solomon Islands for understanding the effects of timber corporations on environmental management in tropical regions.

Abstract: This paper shows that an economic slump can induce a government to invest in fiscal capacity. Large negative income shocks stress the revenue-raising capability of narrow tax bases, making an increase in tax base breadth desirable relative to its fixed implementation cost. A broader tax base enables revenue to be raised at lower tax rates, and so lower deadweight loss. The behavior of US state governments during the Great Depression supports the model: states experiencing larger than average negative income shocks were more likely to adopt a retail sales tax than were states experiencing smaller than average income shocks.

Abstract: Multinational firms often shift their incomes to low-tax jurisdictions, thus robbing host states of tax revenue. I offer a new theory to explain why some firms do this while others do not. I argue that firms that are more vulnerable to government expropriation are, counterintuitively, less likely to shift income offshore, since complying fully with tax law gives the government a greater stake in their survival. Analyzing a registry-based panel data on multinational firms, their tax burdens, and a cross-sectional information of the firms' connections to tax havens, l find that, other things equal, firms with more concentrated fixed assets are less likely to use havens. These results challenge existing theories of the political economy of development. Whereas the "Pillars of Prosperity"theory suggests that successful states simultaneously develop protection of property rights and fiscal capacity, my results show that perfect property rights protection can actually undermine the state's ability to tax.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to gauge the various determinants of social sector spending captured by social protection and education spending in a cross section of developing countries, a subject on which there is scant empirical evidence. We hypothesize that fiscal capacity is necessary but not sufficient for resource allocation in this area, because the political will to do so must also be present. Using a panel data instrumental variable approach, we find that greater fiscal capacity robustly raises social spending in developing countries in the period 1990 to 2010. It is also strongly evident that rising democratisation enhances social sector spending; the presence of greater democracy and higher fiscal capacity could reinforce this effect. Our work also innovatively incorporates inequality into the analysis, finding that social expenditure is greater in more egalitarian societies. Military expenditure also appears to crowd out social protection expenditure, but not robustly.

Abstract: Motivated by agency theory, we investigate the effect of board independence on dividend policy. We exploit as a quasi-natural experiment the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the associ-ated exchange listing requirement, mandating firms to have a majority of independent directors. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that firms forced to raise board independence are significantly more likely to pay dividends than firms not required to change board independence. Our results are consistent with the notion that stronger board independence forces managers to disgorge more cash to shareholders, thereby reducing what is left for possible expropriation by opportunistic managers. Based on an exogenous regulatory shock, our results are more likely to show a casual effect, rather than merely an association.

Abstract: Does internal conflict erode national identity in Sub-Saharan Africa? We explore this question in the con-text of the 2012 Tuareg rebellion in Mali. The timing of the conflict was plausibly exogenous: the fall of al-Gaddafi's regime in Libya in 2011 triggered the return of the Tuareg fighters from the demised leader's Praetorian guard to their homeland in Northern Mali. Using representative survey data on the salience of national and ethnic identities, we perform a difference-in-differences estimation and find that the out-break of the conflict prompted Malian residents living closer to the conflict zone to decrease their national identity more than the residents further away. We argue that this effect is likely to have been driven by proximity to violent events perpetrated by separatist groups and not by selective migration, exposure to internally displaced persons, communal violence, or other potential alternative explanations. Our results are consistent with the qualitative evidence on the matter. We place these findings in the con-text of recent theoretical advances in identity economics.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Migrant remittances and the onset of civil war

Abstract: Civil wars reflect, in part, internal contestation over the provision of resources. A government's ability to buy off rebellion by providing social welfare payments is one mechanism to help ensure social stability. In times of economic distress, however, the government becomes increasingly constrained in its ability to provide social welfare and, absent some form of financial relief, will be subject to increasing pressure from potential rebel groups. Migrant remittances can serve as a smoothing mechanism that provides for social welfare needs outside the formal mechanisms of the state, and therefore acts to reduce the incentive for rebellion. We develop a model of migrant remittances as a vehicle that provides domestic stability in times of economic constraints. We test hypotheses from this model on World Bank remittance data to 152 countries from 1980 to 2005. Our results suggest that a significant increase in migrant remittances during crises can lower the risk of civil war.

Abstract: This study examines the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict and investigates the possible moderating role of government economic support during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. Our main hypothesis suggests that countries with lower levels of gov-ernment economic support are more likely to experience a positive correlation between higher COVID-19 mortality rates and the emergence of internal conflict. Using cross-country data from over 100 countries and controlling for various factors that may influence internal conflict, our analysis provides some support for this hypothesis. The results suggest a possible moderating role for government economic support, with the evidence indicating a weakening or elimination of the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict when government economic support is adequate. However, the moderating effect of government economic support is not always significant, and caution is needed when interpreting the results. Our analysis also high-lights the potential risks associated with low levels of government economic support during the pandemic. Specifically, we find that in countries where the government's macro-financial pack-age in response to the pandemic is less than approximately 25% of GDP, there is a possible risk of growth in civil disorder resulting from increased COVID-19 deaths per million.

Abstract: This study presents a machine-learning-enhanced method of modeling PM2.5 personal exposures in a data-scarce, rural, solid fuel use context. Data collected during a cookstove (Africa Clean Energy (ACE)-1 solar-battery-powered stove) intervention program in rural Lao PDR are presented and leveraged to explore advanced techniques for predicting personal exposures to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). Mean 48-h PM2.5 exposure concentrations for female cooks were measured for the pre- and post-intervention periods (the "Before" and "After" periods, respectively) as 123 mu g/m(3) and 81 mu g/m(3). Mean 48-h PM(2.5 )kitchen air pollution ("KAP") concentrations were measured at 462 mu g/m(3) Before and 124 mu g/m(3) After. Application of machine learning and ensemble modeling demonstrated cross-validated personal exposure predictions that were modest at the individual level but reasonably strong at the group level, with the best models producing an observed vs. predicted r(2) between 0.26 and 0.31 (r(2) = 0.49 when using a smaller, un-imputed dataset) and mean Before estimates of 119-120 pg/m(3) and After estimates of 86-88 mu g/m(3). This offered improvement over one typical method of predicting exposure - using a kitchen exposure factor (the ratio of exposure to KAP)-which demonstrated an r(2) similar to 0.03 and poorly estimated group average values. The results of these analyses highlight areas of methodological improvement for future exposure assessments of household air pollution and provide evidence for researchers to explore the advantages of further incorporating machine learning methods into similar research across wider geographic and cultural contexts.

Abstract: Background Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning is a largely preventable cause of death that has received insufficient attention. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive global analysis of the demographic, temporal, and geographical patterns of fatal unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from 2000 to 2021. Methods As part of the latest Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning mortality was quantified using the GBD cause of death ensemble modelling strategy. Vital registration data and covariates with an epidemiological link to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning informed the estimates of death counts and mortality rates for all locations, sexes, ages, and years included in the GBD. Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying deaths by remaining standard life expectancy at age of death. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning deaths due to occupational injuries and high alcohol use were estimated. Findings In 2021, the global mortality rate due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning was 0 center dot 366 per 100 000 (95% uncertainty interval 0 center dot 276-0 center dot 415), with 28 900 deaths (21 700-32 800) and 1 center dot 18 million YLLs (0 center dot 886-1 center dot 35) across all ages. Nearly 70% of deaths occurred in males (20 100 [15 800-24 000]), and the 50-54-year age group had the largest number of deaths (2210 [1660-2590]). The highest mortality rate was in those aged 85 years or older with 1 center dot 96 deaths (1 center dot 38-2 center dot 32) per 100 000. Eastern Europe had the highest age-standardised mortality rate at 2 center dot 12 deaths (1 center dot 98-2 center dot 30) per 100 000. Globally, there was a 53 center dot 5% (46 center dot 2-63 center dot 7) decrease in the age-standardised mortality rate from 2000 to 2021, although this decline was not uniform across regions. The overall PAFs for occupational injuries and high alcohol use were 13 center dot 6% (11 center dot 9-16 center dot 0) and 3 center dot 5% (1 center dot 4-6 center dot 2), respectively. Interpretation Improvements in unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning mortality rates have been inconsistent across regions and over time since 2000. Given that unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning is almost entirely preventable, policy-level interventions that lower the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning events should be prioritised, such as those that increase access to improved heating and cooking devices, reduce carbon monoxide emissions from generators, and mandate use of carbon monoxide alarms.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited a wide range of national responses with an even wider range of outcomes in terms of infections and mortalities. Australia is a rare success story, keeping deaths comparatively low, and infections too, until the Omicron wave. What explains Australia’s success? Typical explanations emphasise leaders’ choices. We agree, but argue that leaders’ choices, and whether these are implemented effectively, is shaped by the legacy of state transformation. Decades of neo-liberal reforms have hollowed out state capacity and confused lines of control and accountability, leaving Australia unprepared for the pandemic. Leaders thus abandoned plans and turned to ad hoc, simple to implement emergency measures–border closures and lockdowns. These averted large-scale outbreaks and deaths, but with diminishing returns as the Delta variant took hold. Conversely, Australia’s regulatory state has struggled to deliver more sophisticated policy responses, even when leaders were apparently committed, including an effective quarantine system, crucial for border controls, and vaccination programme, essential for exiting the quagmire of lockdowns and closed borders, leading to a partial return to top-down governing. The Australian experience shows that to avoid a public health catastrophe or more damaging lockdowns in the next pandemic, states must re-learn to govern. © 2022 Journal of Contemporary Asia.

Abstract: Focusing predominantly on media coverage, but drawing also on a small selection of other cultural texts, such as film and television, this chapter explores gendered representations of Australian soldiers in the twenty-first century within the context of contemporary debates about Australia’s military role, misogyny and sexism, and the very nature of Australian national identity. Its examination of representations of Australian military personnel and changes to operations since 2001 reveals disconnection between public memory, public image, and an institutional identity that is at odds with the institutional capacity of the Australian Defence Force to enact positive change in relation to social concerns, such as gender equality. It concludes that greater diversity in cultural representations will better support the reality of working in the ADF and the experiences of Australian soldiers in conflict and at peace. © 2017, The Author(s).

Abstract: We examine the effect of stock liquidity and corporate governance on the firm's leverage decision in the order-driven stock trading system and less stringent governance environment of Australia. Using a sample of 1207 non-financial firms from 2001 to 2013, resulting in 9855 firm-year observations, we find the posited negative stock liquidity–leverage relation, confirming prior research observations that firms with more liquid stocks are significantly less leveraged. We also find a significant and negative relation between corporate governance quality (CGQ) and leverage, indicating that firms with high CGQ significantly reduce leverage. In a closer analysis, we find that the significantly negative CGQ–leverage relation exists only for firms with high stock liquidity and does not exist for firms with low stock liquidity. Our study is the first to examine such an interactive relationship among stock liquidity, corporate governance and leverage.

Abstract: Managing large river basins for sustainability is a contentious social–ecological arena challenging traditional scientific and rational planning approaches to water and related natural resources governance. “Crises” are inevitable but double-edged: creating threats and uncertainties, but also new opportunities to shape trajectories of change and avoid adverse consequences. A case study of the large remote cross-border Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), in arid central Australia, shows how over two decades a series of social–ecological and political–administrative “crises” emerged, posing significant environmental and social dilemmas for water governance, while also opening up opportunities for institutional change. This article examines the role of crises in the emergence and evolution of water governance in the LEB, how they were perceived, the challenges and opportunities posed, social and institutional responses, and governance capacity outcomes. Finally, it reflects on emergent crises as opportunities for more systemic and adaptive change in large river basins. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract: Asia–Pacific countries are experiencing rapid economic growth. Is this growth ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors-based and aligned growth? Therefore, this study investigates the connections between ESG indicators and economic growth in East Asia Pacific and South Asia. To achieve this aim, we employed the FMOLS, DOLS, and AMG models. While the AMG model highlights significant long-term positive effects of the environmental (EFs) and governance factors (GOVNF) on economic growth, the FMOLS and DOLS models emphasize the substantial influence of social factors (SOC) on economic growth. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of ESG factors and offer valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align strategies with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Notably, the GOVNF, with components like control of corruption, regulatory quality, rule of law, and government effectiveness, does not influence the GDP of developed nations, such as Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. However, its significance is evident in countries like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. This result might stem from the possibility that developed countries have historically addressed and resolved issues like corruption and the rule of law, while these elements remain crucial determinants for the economic growth of developing nations like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Empirical findings provide the region's policymakers with essential insights and a guide for implementing their economic growth policies ESG factor-based and aligned to the United Nations' SDGs.

Abstract: Coral reef restoration is gaining considerable momentum globally in response to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs. In Australia, as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP), a range of unconventional interventions are currently being investigated to help the Great Barrier Reef resist, repair and recover from climate change. Many of these interventions are based on innovative approaches, such as assisted evolution. The regulatory environment is likely to be critical in determining the feasibility and viability of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It influences what, where and how to restore, who should be responsible for, engaged in, and benefit from restoration. This study explores the regulatory implications of proposed restoration and adaptation interventions in the context of the Great Barrier Reef. This includes mapping the existing regulatory and governance landscape, establishing an approach to account for regulatory requirements of restoration and adaptation interventions, and examining regulatory issues associated with their development and deployment. The study also scopes administrative capacity; i.e., the capacity of regulators in terms of resources and skills required to assess novel risks and impacts of reef restoration and adaptation interventions. It provides important insights that may prove useful for other jurisdictions, where ecosystem restoration and adaptation has become an imperative under a fast-changing climate. © 2019

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Mental Health Public Policy in Global Context: A Comparative Study of Policy Transfer in Samoa and Tonga

Abstract: This book explores the development of mental health systems in the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) of Samoa and Tonga through an examination of several policy transfer events from the colonial to the contemporary. Beginning in the 1990s, mental health became an area of global policy concern as reflected in concerted international organisation and bilateral aid and development agendas, most notably those of the World Bank, World Health Organization, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand. This book highlights how Tonga and Samoa both reformed their respective mental health systems during these years, after relatively long periods of stagnation. Using recent scholarship concerning public policy transfer, this book explains these policy outcomes and expands it to include consideration of the historical institutional dimensions evidenced by contemporary mental health systems. This book considers three distinct levels of policy implicated in mental health system transfer processes from developed to developing nations: colonial authority and influence; decolonisation processes; and the global development agenda surrounding health systems. In the process, the author argues that there are in fact three levels of policy change that must be accounted for in examining contemporary policy change. These policy levels include formal policy transfers, which tend to be prescriptive, involving professional problem construction and the designation of appropriate state apparatus for curative or custodial care provision; quasi-formal transfers, which tend to be aspirational and involve policy instruments developed through collaborative, participatory processes; and informal transfers that tend to be normative and include practices by professional actors in delivering service merged with traditional cultural beliefs as to disease aetiology as well as reflecting a deep understanding of the cultural context within which the services will be delivered. This book argues that a renewed focus on the importance of public policy and government institutional capacity is necessary to ensure human rights and justice are secured. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

Abstract: We develop a state capacity framework to account for different national responses to Covid-19. Our starting point is the influential idea that neoliberalism has a major role to play in state failure to control the pandemic. By implementing neoliberal reforms, states have ostensibly rendered themselves incapable of preventing or mitigating the viral outbreak. A focus on the British experience lends weight to this perspective. But when viewed in a comparative light, the picture is less straightforward. By comparing the British and Australian cases, we see a similar embrace of neoliberal reforms across the whole of government, yet with strikingly divergent outcomes. How can we account for this dramatic difference? To answer this question, we offer an enhanced state capacity framework to improve our understanding of diverse national responses to Covid-19. Our larger objective is to enrich the existing state capacity literature in two ways. First, we extend the existing state capacity framework by introducing a new category–salutary capacity–to encapsulate a state's ability to correct and counteract the course of a national health emergency. Second, we introduce the idea of political choice to emphasise the importance of agency in offsetting the institutional weaknesses associated with neoliberal reform. © 2021 The Author(s).

Abstract: Classical organizational management literature draws clear parallels between organizational culture and climate and effective use of power and influence as key to successful policy implementation of reforms in public sector organizations. On the other hand, the public policy literature, in particular, policy transfer as a strand within policy studies, emphasizes the role of the national context, more specifically, ‘facilitators’ and ‘constraints’ of ‘‘politico-administrative culture” within the national context, as crucial to understanding processes of transfer, convergence, and diffusion of public policy. There is a plethora of studies by Western scholars of public management who have successfully utilized these theoretical underpinnings to study the effectiveness of public service reforms in mature policy environments such as the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand, and others. However, the public policy and comparative public management literature only offers a limited number of case studies from developing, middle-/upper-middle countries, which rely on concepts of organizational management in addition to narratives on the impact of policy learning from global doctrines, such as Weberianism, New Public Management (NPM), and New Public Governance (NPG), and national politics, on the implementation of administrative reforms in those contexts. Kazakhstan, as a resource-affluent post-Soviet country and a bastion of modernization and ‘open government’ in Central Asia or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the post-Soviet era is a case in point. Based on ethnographic research consisting of interviews with elite academics, civil servants, and think-tank activists, as well as reviews of OECD and government strategy reports in Astana, the findings point to a potential abatement of the impact of context constraints such as large power distance and collectivist behavior by context facilitators such as those surrounding the use of ‘trilingualism’ and public diplomacy towards reforms in Kazakhstan particularly in recent years. © 2024 by the author.

Abstract: Water plays an important role in underpinning equitable, stable and productive societies and ecosystems. Hence, United Nations recognized ensuring water security as one (Goal 6) of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs). Many international river basins are likely to experience 'low water security' over the coming decades. Water security is rooted not only in the physical availability of freshwater resources relative to water demand, but also on social and economic factors (e.g. sound water planning and management approaches, institutional capacity to provide water services, sustainable economic policies). Until recently, advanced tools and methods are available for the assessment of water scarcity. However, quantitative and integrated - physical and socio-economic - approaches for spatial analysis of water security at global level are not available yet. In this study, we present a spatial multi-criteria analysis framework to provide a global assessment of water security. The selected indicators are based on Goal 6 of SDGs. The term 'security' is conceptualized as a function of 'availability', 'accessibility to services', 'safety and quality', and 'management'. The proposed global water security index (GWSI) is calculated by aggregating indicator values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using the ordered weighted average method, which allows for the exploration of the sensitivity of final maps to different attitudes of hypothetical policy makers. Our assessment suggests that countries of Africa, South Asia and Middle East experience very low water security. Other areas of high water scarcity, such as some parts of United States, Australia and Southern Europe, show better GWSI values, due to good performance of management, safety and quality, and accessibility. The GWSI maps show the areas of the world in which integrated strategies are needed to achieve water related targets of the SDGs particularly in the African and Asian continents. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Abstract: Food systems and the communities they support are increasingly challenged by climate change and the need to arrest escalating threats through mitigation and adaptation. To ensure climate change mitigation strategies can be implemented effectively and to support substantial gains in greenhouse gas emissions reduction, it is, therefore, valuable to understand where climatesmart strategies might be used for best effect. We assessed mariculture in 171 coastal countries for vulnerabilities to climate change (12 indicators) and opportunities to deliver climate mitigation outcomes (nine indicators). We identified Northern America and Europe as having comparatively lower regional vulnerability and higher opportunity for impact on climate mitigation. Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway and the United States of America were identified as wellpositioned to advance strategies linked to mariculture. However, the nature of vulnerabilities and opportunities within and between all regions and countries varied, due to the formation of existing mariculture, human development factors and governance capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that global discussion will be valuable to motivating climate-smart approaches associated with mariculture, but to ensure these solutions contribute to a resilient future, for industry, ecosystems and communities, local adaptation will be needed to address constraints and to leverage local prospects.

Abstract: This research investigates the value of teaching philosophies (TP) for today’s academics and their institutions. It offers a new framework to enhance academic development, personal resilience, and institutional capacity building. Since the 1990s, TPs have been formalised as personally constructed and reflectively written statements of educational values, beliefs, and practices. Whereas within universities, TPs have been institutionalised for academic performance reviews, awards, and promotions. In-depth personal interviews on TPs and their value on personal journeys and institutional experiences were conducted with academics from Australia and Canada. The findings highlight the value and future potential of TPs beyond a formulaic role. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Behavioural change and cultural evolution, rather than cultural change: Insights for Australian Public Service Reform

Abstract: Cultural change is often positioned as central to transformation within the Australian Public Service (APS). The ongoing focus on cultural change suggests it has not yet been realised, which is unsurprising, given it is so difficult to change. However, cultural change may also be impeded due to the way it is portrayed within the APS. This article draws on the work of Schein to identify three problems with how organisational culture and cultural change are portrayed in the APS, including the focus on a unified APS culture, the simplistic way in which culture is portrayed, and the general and high-level claims for how to achieve cultural change. It provides three recommendations for how these problems can be addressed, including focusing on high-level principles for conduct across the APS (rather than a unified APS culture), focusing on cultural evolution at the department, agency, and subunit levels, and supporting cultural evolution through establishing mechanisms for behavioural change. Adopting this approach could enable the APS to realise desired changes and enable success of the Albanese Government's APS reform agenda. Points for practitioners: Cultural change is difficult to achieve due to culture being deeply embedded, underpinned by a stable system of values, beliefs, and assumptions. Change could be realised within the APS through focusing on cultural evolution, rather than cultural change—specifically at the department, agency, and subunit levels where there is some compatibility between existing and desired cultures. Cultural evolution requires the identification of the specific behaviours required for effective change, followed by a reconfiguration of a range of mechanisms required to embed and reinforce behavioural change. Leaders play a central role in facilitating behavioural change and cultural evolution, but doing this effectively may require leadership cognitive shifts; therefore, leaders need support and development. © 2023 The Authors.

Abstract: Improving the energy efficiency of economies is the core of promoting global sustainable development. At present, improving energy efficiency is a common problem faced by all countries. In this paper, the Three-stage DEA model improved by radial slack based measure (SBM) model is used to evaluate the energy efficiency and influencing factors of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) members. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes of energy efficiency of each country are further explored by the Malmquist index model. The empirical analysis shows that the energy efficiency of China, Japan, and Australia are all 1, which is at the forefront of efficiency, while the energy efficiency of Vietnam is the lowest, which is 0.136. China's technological progress change index is 1.013, leading other countries. The results of the study are helpful to understand the trend of energy efficiency changes in various countries, to transform their energy efficiency advantages into the common advantages of each member state, and to improve the comprehensive governance capacity of energy efficiency of each country. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: Germany's activities in the transnationalization of higher education reveal distinctive patterns of its policy coordination. In contrast to sending countries such as Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, German state actors are involved in the implementation of cross-border projects. In the article, we analyze data in connection to the theoretical debate on the nation state's role in policy coordination. We therefore introduce the policy design to study the coordination practices employed by state actors while mapping changes in the institutional arrangements of German transnational education. As a result, we discuss a new form of policy layering, which we propose to call ‘horizontal layering’. Originating in the observation of competing state actors and their strategies to avoid interdepartmental conflicts, this type of policy design leads to a policy field charged with an increasing number of partially contradictory policy objectives, lowering the state's capacity for efficient policy formulation. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization

Abstract: This article analyses the redistributive efficiency of social transfers and direct taxation in a panel of 28 developed economies during the period 1995–2010. In order to explore how redistribution is achieved through these fiscal policies, a two-stage approach is applied. First, we evaluate their redistributive efficiency – the degree of redistribution attained for a given level of transfers and taxes – using data envelopment analysis (DEA). We find lower redistributive efficiency in Southern Europe and the United States and higher efficiency levels in the Nordic and Central European countries and Australia. Second, we use panel regression analysis to identify the determinants of efficiency differences and reveal the crucial role of government quality as well as factors affecting the redistributive profile of fiscal policies. © The Author(s) 2017.

Abstract: Background: Indigenous young people worldwide possess unique protective factors that support wellbeing. However, they experience mental illness at higher rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. Digital mental health (dMH) resources can increase access to structured, timely, and culturally tailored mental health interventions by reducing structural and attitudinal barriers to accessing treatment. The involvement of Indigenous young people in dMH resource development is recommended, however, no guidelines exist on how this can best be facilitated. Methods: A scoping review examining processes to involve Indigenous young people in developing or evaluating dMH interventions was conducted. Studies reported between 1990 and 2023 involving Indigenous young people aged 12–24 years, originating from Canada, the USA, New Zealand, and Australia, in the development or evaluation of dMH interventions were eligible for inclusion. Following a three-step search process, four electronic databases were searched. Data were extracted, synthesized, and described under three categories: dMH intervention attributes, study design, and alignment with research best practice. Best practice recommendations for Indigenous research and participatory design principles derived from the literature were identified and synthesised. Included studies were assessed against these recommendations. Consultation with two Senior Indigenous Research Officers ensured Indigenous worldviews informed analysis. Results: Twenty-four studies describing eleven dMH interventions met inclusion criteria. Studies included formative, design, pilot, and efficacy studies. Overall, most included studies demonstrated a high degree of Indigenous governance, capacity building, and community benefit. All studies adapted their research processes to ensure that local community protocols were followed and most aligned these within an Indigenous research paradigm. Formal agreements regarding existing and created intellectual property and implementation evaluations were rare. Outcomes were the primary focus of reporting, with limited detailed descriptions of governance and decision-making processes or strategies for managing predictable tensions between co-design stakeholders. Conclusions: This study identified recommendations for undertaking participatory design with Indigenous young people and evaluated the current literature against these criteria. Common gaps were evident in the reporting of study processes. Consistent, in-depth reporting is needed to allow assessment of approaches for this hard-to-reach population. An emergent framework, informed by our findings, for guiding the involvement of Indigenous young people in the design and evaluation of dMH tools is presented.

Abstract: Background Few studies have explored behavioural and financial impacts of retail initiatives after 2 years to address the unhealthy food environments common in local government sporting settings. Aims To evaluate the impact of a 2-year local government capacity building intervention in sporting facility food outlets on (1) the healthiness of refrigerated drink choices available and visible to customers, (2) healthiness of refrigerated drinks sold and (3) refrigerated drink revenue. Methods 52 sporting facilities within 8 local governments from Victoria, Australia, participated in an intervention between March 2018 and February 2020 by limiting € red' (least healthy) drinks to ≤20% of refrigerator display and increasing € green' (healthiest) drinks to ≥50% of display. Mixed models assessed changes in mean percentage of € red', € amber' and € green' drinks displayed over time, compared with baseline. Facilities provided electronic weekly itemised sales data (December 2015 to February 2020). Weekly volume of € red' or € green' drinks sold as a proportion of total drinks sold, and total refrigerated drinks revenue were compared preimplementation and postimplementation using mixed models (seasonal facilities), and mixed-effect interrupted time series models (non-seasonal facilities). Results Display of € red' drinks decreased by mean -17.1 percentage points (pp) (95% CI -23.9 to -10.3) and € green' drinks increased 16.1 pp (95% CI 9.30, 22.9) between baseline and 18-month audits. At nine seasonal facilities, compared with the summer preimplementation, the mean volume of € red' drinks sold decreased by -19.0 pp (95% CI -28.6, to -9.51) and refrigerated drink revenue decreased by-AU$81.8 (95% CI -AU$123 to -AU$40.8) per week. At 15 non-seasonal facilities, by February 2020, the volume of € red' drinks sold decreased on average by -11.0 pp (95% CI -21.6 to -0.41) with no change in drink revenue. Conclusion Reducing the display of unhealthy drinks can be an effective public health policy to improve the healthiness of customer purchases, provided there is consideration of potential impacts on revenue.  © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

Abstract: Australia's terrestrial environment has been dramatically modified since European colonisation. Deforestation - the clearing and modification of native forest for agricultural, urban and industrial development - remains a significant threat to Australia's biodiversity. Substantial policy reform over the last 40 years has delivered a range of policy instruments aimed to control deforestation across all Australian States and Territories. Despite these policy efforts - as well as strong governance and high institutional capacity - deforestation rates in Australia were nonetheless globally significant at the turn of this century. Legislation introduced in Queensland and New South Wales during the mid-2000s was at the time seen to have effectively ended broad-scale clearing; however, recent policy changes have raised concerns that Australia may again become a global hotspot for deforestation. Here, I describe the deforestation trends, drivers and policy responses in Australia over the last four decades. Using satellite imagery of forest cover and deforestation events across Australia between 1972 and 2014, I present a comprehensive analysis of deforestation rates at a fine resolution. I discuss trends in deforestation with reference to the institutional, macroeconomic and environmental conditions that are associated with human-induced forest loss in Australia. I provide a detailed history and critique of the native vegetation policies introduced across Australia over the last 40 years, including recent legislative amendments and reviews. Finally, I comment on future prospects for curbing deforestation in Australia, including the role of incentive-based policies such as carbon farming, private land conservation and biodiversity offsets. Despite being a highly active policy space, very little is known of the effectiveness of policy responses to deforestation in Australia, and whether the recent shift away from 'command and control' policies will necessarily lead to better outcomes. My analysis demonstrates the need for an effective policy mix to curb deforestation in Australia, including a greater focus on monitoring, evaluation and policy learning. © CSIRO 2016.

Abstract: Despite the billions of dollars invested in improving Indigenous health and wellbeing outcomes in Australia, there is little evidence of program effectiveness to inform policy and practice. The deficiency of evaluations is problematic. Critical to this process is the effective engagement of commissioners with Indigenous peoples, which is not well documented. Currently, there is scant evidence on modes of commissioning practices used. This scoping review will aim to identify the spectrum of commissioning practices used when evaluating Indigenous health and wellbeing programs in Australia, codifying them into a model set. Documents (between 2008 and 2020) will be retrieved from Scopus, Proquest, Informit, Google Scholar and via a web-based search that refers to the commissioning of Indigenous health and wellbeing program evaluations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada or the United States. Importantly, the research team is Indigenous-led and the project’s governance, quality and translation framework will be informed by a project advisory group, including Indigenous associates. This will be the first scoping review globally to identify practices used to commission Indigenous health and wellbeing program evaluations. Results will be utilised to strengthen the commissioning practices of Indigenous health and wellbeing programs in Australia and overseas. © The Author(s) 2023.

Abstract: Background: With their close connection to community and increasing preventive health remit, local governments are well positioned to implement policies and programs to address health inequities. Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence of equity-focused policy action in this sector. We aimed to understand how local government representatives approach equity in the development and implementation of health and wellbeing policies and programs, and to identify potential enablers for strengthening an equity focus. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews (June 2022-January 2023) with 29 health directorate representatives from 21 local governments in Victoria, Australia. Representatives were recruited from urban, regional and rural local government areas, with varying levels of socioeconomic position. Data was analysed inductively using Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis, informed by social determinants of health theory and a public policy decision making framework. Results: Local governments approach health equity in different ways including focusing on priority populations, disadvantaged geographic areas, or by targeting the upstream determinants of health, such as housing and employment. Enabling factors for more equity-oriented local government policy action included those internal to local governments: (i) having a clear conceptualisation of equity, (ii) fostering a strong equity-centric culture, and (iii) developing organisational-wide competency in health equity. External factors related to key stakeholder groups that support and/or influence local governments included: (iv) strong support from community, (v) state government leadership and legislation, and (vi) supportive local partners, networks and NGO’s. Conclusions: Local governments have a responsibility to implement policies and programs that improve health and reduce health inequities. Local government’s capacity to leverage resources, structures, processes and relationships, internally and across sectors and community, will be key to strengthening equity-oriented local government health policies and programs. © 2023, The Author(s).

Abstract: In public service reforms across Australia, the task of adapting to the “digital age” is prioritised over broader societal adaptations to interrelated economic, health, and ecological crises. Within this landscape, design tools travel freely and rapidly through a plurality of entangled service worlds. However, when presented as universal and neutral towards the technologies and worldviews that shape public services, design tools potentially displace alternative approaches to servicing publics. Through two co-designing events with a waste service provider and a service design workshop, we outline the ways we employ a “plurality” of design tools that catalyse Indigenous and western knowledge systems. We consider how practices with design tools that amplify plural worldviews nurtures relational thinking, allowing people to “see” tensions, consequences, and redirections for public service designing. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.

Abstract: Background: Recent complex and cross-boundary policy problems, such as climate change, pandemics, and financial crises, have recentred debates about state capacity, democratic discontent and the 'crisis of expertise'. These problems are contested and open to redefinition, misunderstanding, spin, and deception, challenging the ability of policymakers to locate, discriminate, comprehend, and respond to competing sources of knowledge and expertise. We argue that 'non-knowledge' is an under-explored aspect of responses to major policy crises. Key points: While discussed in recent work in sociology and other social sciences, non-knowledge has been given less explicit attention in policy studies, and is not fully captured by orthodox understandings of knowledge and evidence use. We outline three main forms of non-knowledge that challenge public agencies: amnesia, ignorance and misinformation. In each case, 'non-knowledge' is not simply the absence of policy-relevant knowledge. Amnesia refers to what is forgotten, reinvented or 'unlearned', while claims of ignorance involve obscuring or casting aside of relevant knowledge that could (or even should) be available. To be misinformed is to actively believe false or misleading information. In each instance, non-knowledge may have strategic value for policy actors or aid the pursuit of self-interest. Conclusions and implications: We demonstrate the relevance of non-knowledge through a brief case study, emerging from the inquiry into the COVID-19 hotel quarantine programme in the Australian state of Victoria. We argue that both amnesia and 'practical' forms of ignorance contributed to failures during the early part of the programme.  © Policy Press 2023.

Abstract: Thailand’s transition to a low-carbon economy faces significant challenges, including a dependency on fossil fuels, fluctuating energy costs, and limited policy clarity. This study conducts a comparative analysis of energy transition policies in Germany, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore to derive actionable lessons that can be adapted to Thailand’s socio-economic and energy contexts. Using the Integrated National Energy Planning (INEP) framework and Network Governance Theory, the research identifies key strategies, such as setting clear and achievable renewable energy targets, establishing robust legal frameworks, fostering multi-stakeholder engagement, and encouraging decentralized governance. The findings highlight the importance of long-term vision, inclusive governance, and targeted investments in renewable technologies to accelerate energy transitions. This paper presents policy guidelines to enhance Thailand’s energy security and contribute to its climate goals by promoting public awareness and strengthening institutional capacities. By adapting these strategies, Thailand can align with global energy trends, reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, and advance toward a resilient and sustainable energy system, aligned with global energy trends while addressing its unique socio-economic context. © 2024 by the author.

Abstract: Why does corruption persist over long periods of time? Why is it so difficult to eliminate? Suggesting that corruption is deeply rooted in the underlying social and historical political structures of a country, Uslaner observes that there is a powerful statistical relationship between levels of mass education in 1870 and corruption levels in 2010 across 78 countries. He argues that an early introduction of universal education is shown to be linked to levels of economic equality and to efforts to increase state capacity. Societies with more equal education gave citizens more opportunities and power for opposing corruption, whilst the need for increased state capacity was a strong motivation for the introduction of universal education in many countries. Evidence for this argument is presented from statistical models, case studies from Northern and Southern Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as a discussions of how some countries escaped the 'trap' of corruption. Presents a novel argument on the relationship between corruption and economic equality, through universal education Uses both statistical analysis and case studies to present evidence on the impact of higher education on corruption Presents historical analysis of how education across the world developed and shaped governance. © Eric M.

Abstract: In October 2012, Australia's parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that a mediation support unit should be created within the Australian Agency for International Development, a department now amalgamated with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The question is: Does Australia possess the motivation and capacity to implement active and effective international mediation by building the capacity of intermediaries to deploy various peacemaking methods to hasten de-escalation at different stages of a conflict? If not, is a mediation support unit an appropriate initiative to address this capability gap? This article draws on quantitative conflict data sets and an expert panel to conclude that Australia's track record demonstrates significant capacity to undertake international mediation, but that the mediation personnel and processes available to government are insufficiently resourced and coordinated to readily provide policymakers with accessible tools to undertake the diverse range of mediation strategies advocated by conflict scholars. While a mediation support unit would address some of these issues, at present it conflicts with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's institutional philosophy based on diffused expertise. © 2016 Australian Institute of International Affairs.

Abstract: Local government in Australia has a strong collective capacity to reduce GHG emissions through policies, funding allocation to renewable energy projects and the delivery of programs and services. This study examines the institutional capacity of councils in Sydney and how this impacts on decisions to invest in alternative energy projects. We find greenhouse gas emission targets of councils are strongly aligned to national targets but do not reflect the local council's institutional capacity, political leadership or strategic priorities. Energy reduction projects are often identified and undertaken by environmental staff without support from financial staff or financial-evaluation tools. An absence of national guidelines to provide consistency in tracking and reporting limits cross-sector benchmarking. Street lighting contributes to a significant proportion of council's total electricity expenditure and GHG emission profile. Being highly regulated, existing contracts and the current practice of street lighting services limits the councils’ ability to reduce emissions. Based on our analysis we recommend a number of measures to overcome these constraints including the use of financial evaluation tools for small-scale renewable energy projects, a standardised national tracking and reporting platform to facilitate progress-reporting and meaningful comparative analysis between councils and policy reform to the regulation of street lighting. © 2016

Abstract: This paper is about the capacity of the federal government in Australia to achieve its stated water management and environmental goals in relation to the Murray-Darling River system via its Murray-Darling Basin Plan of 2012. The paper uses a 'state capacity' approach. One aspect of state capacity is about the state's broad institutional capabilities; these are the ways in which the state's resources and policy instruments,its institutions,and its knowledge and data capabilities can shape the state's capacity to achieve its stated goals. The second aspect is relational,emphasising the notion of 'infrastructural power',or how states might be able to achieve their goals by working cooperatively with major interlocutors in the broader state or in society. These two aspects are typically viewed from a state-centric perspective,with the state depicted as using its broad institutional capacities to help further its relational or infrastructural power over other interlocutors. In contrast,this paper shows how this process has been reversed,and how key interlocutors,including important players in federal and state governments and powerful irrigation interests,have instead drawn resources from and manipulated the key institutional elements of state capacity to suit their own interests,weaken the federal state’s infrastructural power,and subvert the stated aims of the Basin Plan. © This Article Is Distributed Under The Terms Of The Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Sharealike License Which Permits Any Non Commercial Use,Distribution,And Reproduction In Any Medium,Provided The Original Author(S) And Source Are Credited.

Abstract: Given the global crises confronting the world today, it is important to interrogate the notion of “the modern state” and to evaluate its effectiveness in providing security and services for its populations, including the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. This book investigates the modern state’s capacity to serve its constituents by examining the organisations that facilitate two key elements of contemporary living: social capital and social enterprise. These elements are explored in a series of rich case studies located in Australia, Ireland and Bangladesh, with broader implications for policy and practice in the rest of the world. The case studies highlight the growing importance of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship in fostering social capital and in contributing to the idea of “the enabling state”. This book will appeal to researchers, policy-makers and community leaders working in business, education, employment pathways, homelessness, housing, local government, mental health, public administration and refugee resettlement. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Board sub-committee effectiveness, director attraction and director attrition: Do nomination and remuneration committees matter?

Abstract: This study examines whether the effectiveness of board subcommittees is associated with director attrition and the attraction of new directors to boards. Using a sample of firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, we find that nomination and remuneration committee effectiveness is inversely associated with director attrition and positively related to new external directors joining boards. The results suggest the contribution of these subcommittees to improve corporate governance by strengthening the board's human capital through recruitment and retention of suitable talent. Furthermore, the influence of subcommittee effectiveness on attrition (attraction) is more pronounced in firms experiencing higher levels of information asymmetry, weaker governance quality and poorer performance. The results are robust to tests with alternative variables, entropy balanced matching, and additional controls. Overall, our findings show that improved governance through effective subcommittees helps maintain and enhance the human capital of boards. © 2024

Abstract: This study offers new insights into the largest threats to natural and mixed World Heritage sites in developed countries as considered by their management. In addition to this, the capacity of the management to deal with threats is examined. An Ordered Probit model is used that distinguishes three groups of threats and four categories of adaptive capacity of the management. Data originate from the 2014 UNESCO Periodic Report II for sites in economically advanced countries (Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea) linked to the World Heritage Site database. Estimation results reveal that the probability of a major threat to World Heritage sites is perceived to be highest in the category of climate change and extreme weather events, followed by local conditions affecting the physical structure (temperature, rain, dust). Sites in tropical climates are perceived as significantly more threatened, as are those earlier listed as in danger. The likelihood of perceiving a major threat is highest in Turkey, Italy, Norway and North America. Threats related to climate change are those the management has the lowest capacity to deal with when other important aspects are controlled for. Large and natural areas have a higher perceived administrative capacity to deal with threats than others. © 2023, The Author(s).

Abstract: This paper explores the association between director turnover and increased audit fees in Australia. The study, aligned with upper echelon theory, reveals that the characteristics and actions of top management, as reflected in director turnover, impact corporate decisions and risk-taking behavior. Specifically, higher director turnover is linked to elevated audit fees, disrupting the stability of top management's monitoring and advisory functions. The association is more pronounced for external turnover compared to internal turnover. Additionally, firms with robust corporate governance quality exhibit a weakened positive relationship between director turnover and audit fees. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic further amplifies the director turnover/audit fees connection. The findings suggest that auditors are likely to consider and price in the impact of board instability on internal controls and monitoring/advisory functions. © 2023

Abstract: The Auditor General's performance audit into the failings of the Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program has led to a ministerial resignation and a parliamentary inquiry. The media melee prompted by the ‘sports rorts’ affair has focussed on political corruption of process, with a concentration on the role of ministerial advisers. This is only part of the story. This article argues that on this occasion the Australian Public Service (APS) did not acquit itself well, and that the affair was triggered by an administrative failure to advise on threshold legal and procedural issues: what is termed the ‘traffic light’ role of a professional public service. The article considers how such policy advice failings may have occurred, and whether APS performance in this instance is an indicator of declining institutional capacity. © 2020 Institute of Public Administration Australia

Abstract: Background: The use of government health data for secondary purposes, such as monitoring the quality of hospital services, researching the health needs of populations, and testing how well new treatments work, is increasing. This increase in the secondary uses of health data has led to increased interest in what the public thinks about data sharing, in particular, the possibilities of sharing with the private sector for research and development. Although international evidence demonstrates broad public support for the secondary use of health data, this support does not extend to sharing health data with the private sector. If governments intend to share health data with the private sector, knowing what the public thinks will be important. This paper reports a national survey to explore public attitudes in Australia toward sharing health data with private companies for research on and development of therapeutic drugs and medical devices. Objective: This study aims to explore public attitudes in Australia toward sharing government health data with the private sector. Methods: A web-based survey tool was developed to assess attitudes about sharing government health data with the private sector. A market research company was employed to administer the web-based survey in June 2019. Results: The survey was completed by 2537 individuals residing in Australia. Between 51.8% and 57.98% of all participants were willing to share their data, with slightly fewer in favor of sharing to improve health services (51.99%) and a slightly higher proportion in favor of sharing for research and development (57.98%). There was a preference for opt-in consent (53.44%) and broad support for placing conditions on sharing health information with private companies (62% to 91.99%). Wide variability was also observed in participants’ views about the extent to which the private sector could be trusted and how well they would behave if entrusted with people’s health information. In their qualitative responses, the participants noted concerns about private sector corporate interests, corruption, and profit making and expressed doubt about the Australian government’s capacity to manage data sharing safely. The percentages presented are adjusted against the Australian population. Conclusions: This nationally representative survey provides preliminary evidence that Australians are uncertain about sharing their health data with the private sector. Although just over half of all the respondents supported sharing health data with the private sector, there was also strong support for strict conditions on sharing data and for opt-in consent and significant concerns about how well the private sector would manage government health data. Addressing public concern about sharing government health data with the private sector will require more and better engagement to build community understanding about how agencies can collect, share, protect, and use their personal data. ©Annette Braunack-Mayer, Belinda Fabrianesi, Jackie Street, Pauline O'Shaughnessy, Stacy M Carter, Lina Engelen, Lucy Carolan, Rebecca Bosward, David Roder, Kylie Sproston.

Abstract: Indigenous peoples within the Murray–Darling Basin have traditionally struggled for the recognition of their cultural, social, environmental, spiritual, commercial and economic connection to the waters that they have traditionally used, as well as their right to engage in all stages of water planning processes. Despite Australian national and federal frameworks providing for the inclusion of Indigenous Australians’ objectives in planning frameworks, water plans have rarely addressed these objectives in water, or the strategies to achieve them. Indeed, insufficient resources, a lack of institutional capacity in both Indigenous communities and agencies and an inadequate understanding of Indigenous people's objectives in water management have limited the extent to which Indigenous objectives are addressed in water plans within the Murray–Darling Basin. In this context, the adoption of specific guidelines to meet Indigenous requirements in relation to basin water resources is crucial to support Indigenous engagement in water planning processes. Using insights from participatory planning methods and human rights frameworks, this article outlines a set of alternative and collaborative guidelines to improve Indigenous involvement in water planning and to promote sustainable and just water allocations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: The concept of ‘justiciability’ in Australian federal jurisprudence has been described by the High Court as a ‘slippery term of indeterminate reference’. With the High Court yet to comprehensively consider the concept of justiciability, Australia’s jurisprudence has failed to develop a coherent doctrine which is apt to govern the outer limits of judicial power under Chapter III of the Constitution. This article argues the transplantation of UK justiciability jurisprudence into Australia’s constitutional context, as well as doctrinal inconsistencies in UK case law, have resulted in applications of the doctrine which undermine key principles of federal judicial power. Drawing on existing case law, this article proposes a reconceptualisation of justiciability into three categories — constitutional competence, institutional capacity and institutional legitimacy — as a principled framework to be applied and developed by Australian jurists going forward. © The Author(s) 2022.

Abstract: Rationale/Purpose: The purpose of the study was to explore how new public management (NPM) components influence the planning and decision-making of local government aquatic and recreation centre (ARCs) development. Methodology: Two case studies were conducted in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Data collection comprised documents (n = 264) and semi-structured interviews (n = 19) to understand the real-life experiences of people involved in ARC planning and decision-making. Deductive analysis was used to identify how NPM components influenced the ARC planning and decision-making process. Findings: ARC planners were primarily driven by financial outputs. Results identified four of the seven NPM components are active in the planning and decision-making across both cases. These include management skills, output controls, creating competition and resource efficiency. Practical implications: From a theoretical perspective, the findings suggest that resource efficiency decisions were prioritised in the ARC decision-making process. Local governments need to consider their motivations towards achieving financial efficiencies and the subsequent impacts on ARC provision. This approach influences local governments’ capacity to address social planning objectives. Research contribution: Local governments in Melbourne, Australia employ NPM principles in their ARC planning and decision-making practices. © 2023 The Author(s).

Abstract: Cyber-enabled foreign interference remains a key threat to many advanced industrial countries. In many cases, the security response has been to build “resilience”–cyber, national and, increasingly, democratic resilience–in line with whole-of-government and whole-of-society strategies. However, many of these securitised responses are “top-down” and elite driven. These resilience agendas do not pay sufficient attention to the views, concerns and threat-perceptions of citizens, potentially undermining their efficacy. In this article, we focus on the Australian case to better understand how citizen cyber skills, threat awareness, and perceptions of institutional capacity can inform democratic resilience to evolving cyber and information risks. We find strong evidence of a clear gap between citizen views and the securitised responses of governments in dealing with cyber-enabled foreign interference. A further issue from the Australian case is that citizens are framed as a passive strategic resource, rather than conceived of as a potentially substantive partner in a “joined-up” response. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Abstract: The study examines the effect of compliance with national governance frameworks on the relationship between corporate governance and the performance of publicly traded companies in Ghana. A sample of 31 companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange was drawn for the study based on their annual reports spanning from 2013 to 2022. A new national governance quality index composed of items drawn from world governance indicators and a corporate governance index was developed by principal component analysis. The study used the Huber M-estimation Robust Least Squares (HMRLS) regression method. The findings of our study reveal that corporate governance practices adversely affect the level of firm performance. However, our results demonstrate that compliance with national governance and institutional frameworks plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. The study offers managerial implications, as listed firms can adopt effective national governance and institutional quality practices to improve firm performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

Abstract: This chapter examines the use of offensive cyber operations by three Western powers (US, UK, Australia) against organized criminals and non-state armed groups. Through the case studies of counter-ISIS operations in 2016-17 and more recent initiatives against ransomware actors, it demonstrates the aims and methods used by state agencies to degrade non-state capacities through cyber means. As these are some of the main case studies of offensive cyber operations in practice available to researchers, they occupy an important, if relatively under-explored, position in the academic and policy landscapes. The chapter outlines the main characteristics of these operations and their roles in expressing and shaping national and collective approaches to offensive cyber operations. It concludes with a consideration of some of the challenges that emerge from the use of offensive cyber capabilities against non-state actors, including measurement of effects and efficacy, their legal and ethical status, and their role as tools of statecraft. © Editors and Contributors Severally 2024.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of corporate governance on the financial choices of non-financial companies operating in the Australian Securities Exchange. A purposive sampling technique was employed to select a total of 113 firms representing 14 sectors listed in the Australian Securities Exchange during the period from 2008 to 2021. The findings of the study revealed a positive and significant relationship between the size of the board, gender diversity among board members, board member affiliation, and board compensation with the financial decisions of the corporations. Additionally, the study identified that the presence of experienced and non-executive board members had a negative and significant impact on internally generated funding. Furthermore, it was observed that board gender diversity, board size, board member affiliation, and board compensation displayed a positive and significant association with debt financing, internally generated financing, and equity financing. Most organisations displayed a preference for internal and debt financing over equity funding. Aligning governance with financial decisions enhances firms’ cost of capital. Governance quality affects capital market access, debt, and equity costs. Effective governance leads to favorable financing terms. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.

Abstract: This case study describes the development and implementation of a governance structure that prioritised First Nations peoples in a local public health Incident Command System activated for the COVID-19 pandemic response in New South Wales, Australia. Using lessons learnt from past pandemics and planning exercises, public health leaders embedded an approach whereby First Nations peoples determined and led community and culturally informed pandemic control strategies and actions. In March 2020, First Nations governance was embedded into the local public health emergency response to COVID-19 in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia, enabling First Nations staff and community members to actively participate in strategic and operational decision-making with the objective of minimising COVID-19-related risks to First Nations peoples and communities. The model provided cultural insight and oversight to the local COVID-19 response; strengthened and advanced First Nations leadership; increased the First Nations public health workforce; led the development of First Nations disease surveillance strategies; and supported working groups to appropriately respond to local needs and priorities. This model demonstrates the feasibility of reframing a standard Incident Command System to embed and value First Nations principles of self-determination and empowerment to appropriately plan and respond to public health emergencies.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Abstract: Global and national strategy emphasises land use planning as a key mechanism for disaster risk reduction (DRR). The practice of planning for natural hazards is devolved to local levels, making the capacity of local government critical for achieving strategic DRR goals. This study assessed the capacity of local governments in Australia to plan for natural hazards. Many Local Government Areas (LGAs) had satisfactory or good hazard planning provision, but remoteness, land area and council size influence poor hazard planning provision. Strategic intent for land use planning as a DRR mechanism is unlikely to be successful in many LGAs without first addressing place-based capacity constraints on hazard planning. © 2021 The Author(s).

Abstract: South Australia is the driest state in the driest inhabited country in the world, Australia. Consequently, water is one of South Australia's highest priorities. Focus on water research and sources of water in the state became more critical during the Millenium drought that occurred between 1997 and 2011. In response to increased concern about water sources the South Australian government established The Goyder Institute for Water Research - a partnership between the South Australian State Government, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Flinders University, University of Adelaide and University of South Australia. The Goyder Institute undertakes cutting-edge science to inform the development of innovative integrated water management strategies to ensure South Australia's ongoing water security and enhance the South Australian Government's capacity to develop and deliver science-based policy solutions in water management. This paper focuses on the integrated water resource assessment of the northern Adelaide region, including the key research investments in water and climate, and how this information is being utilised by decision makers in the region. © Author(s) 2016.

Abstract: This chapter summarises the account of the policy. It is argued that the Rudd Government understood the appearance of a wave of large investments into the Australian raw resource sector as a threat to Australian sovereignty as it disrupted the Government’s capacity for liberal economic governance. It further understood its control over resources needed by the Chinese state as a point of strategic leverage and used this to attempt to open a conversation about the future trajectory of the regional order. The aim was to impress upon the Chinese Government that the new order needed to be actively created rather than passively arrived at, and that it was in China’s and other states’ interest that interstate interactions were made on the basis of liberal markets. © 2019, The Author(s).

Abstract: Of the variety of ways governments, organisations and artists are embedding art and culture within rural tourism strategy, public art trails have emerged as a popular form and approach. However, rural and remote local governments face challenges in realising possible benefits of arts tourism for their communities. This article takes remote northern Australia art tourism initiative, the Savannah Way Art Trail, as a case study to consider principles for successfully connecting public art trails with tourism in remote communities. Processes of delivering the Savannah Way Art Trail are framed and discussed under three themes: 1) local government capacity and relationships; 2) listening to locals; and 3) the ‘art’ of creating and managing remote art trails. These themes are considered as recommendations that can provide ways to enact cultural policy in practice in remote communities, and opportunities for extending the potential for art trails to reflect and benefit those communities. © 2024 The Author(s).

Abstract: This paper explores sovereign risk preferences against direct and indirect natural disasters losses in industrialized countries. Using Australia as a case study, the analysis compares expected disaster losses and government capacity to finance losses. Utilizing a national disaster loss dataset, extreme value theory is applied to estimate an all-hazard annual loss distribution. Unusually but critically, the dataset includes direct as well as indirect losses, allowing for the analysis to consider the oft-ignored issue of indirect losses. Expected annual losses (direct, and direct plus indirect) are overlaid with a risk-layer approach, to distinguish low, medium and extreme loss events. Each risk layer is compared to available fiscal resources for financing losses, grounded in the political reality of Australian disaster financing. When considering direct losses only, we find support for a risk-neutral preference on the part of the Australian government for low and medium loss levels, and a risk-averse preference in regard to extreme losses. When indirect losses are also estimated, we find that even medium loss levels are expected to overwhelm available fiscal resources, thereby violating the available resources assumption underlying arguments for sovereign risk neutrality. Our analysis provides empirical support for the assertion that indirect losses are a major, under-recognised concern for industrialized countries. A risk-averse preference in regard to medium and extreme loss events recommends enhanced investment in both corrective and prospective risk reduction in relation to these risks level, in particular to reduce indirect losses. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Abstract: From a ‘lucky country’ on the edge of the world, Australia and its governments felt they had weathered the pandemic storm in October 2020. But, the insular approach to combatting COVID-19 cracked in the months since. A series of critical failures in government response has been identified. These include vaccine procurement and roll-out, ‘gold standard’ contact tracing that turned out abysmal failures, debilitating border closures and an inability to coordinate policy and governance responses to Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. The liberal federal government architecture cracked—some commentators repeatedly use ‘bungled’—under the pressures in this next chapter in Australia's pandemic response. In this chapter, we do not only describe the deficiencies in the federal and state governments’ capacity to plan strategically and coordinate between data and intervention, we also show that the resilience of communities is essential in responding to crises—but to grow and thrive, proactive government policies will still be required. © TheEditor(s) (ifapplicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021, 2022.

Abstract: Aims: To explore and identify the core elements of the nurse executive role and the contribution these posts make to health service organisations in terms of quality and performance. Background: With the ongoing global reform of health services and, in particular, currently in Australia, this commentary paper explores the available evidence that explains and describes the role that nursing leaders can and do play at executive level in enabling quality services in high performing health-care organisations. Evaluation: While the overall literature is limited in relation to the role and function of nurse executives, there are strong and recurrent themes indicating that nurses by virtue of their professional background and experience can provide effective and influential input to executive boards. Executive nurses are well positioned to influence and lead professional governance, quality improvement, service transformation and change and shared governance. Conclusion: At a time when the role of nursing executives may be questioned, the evidence supports the positive impact of highly skilled nursing executives in contributing to the implementation of effective health services. Successful health services should be engaging nurse executives who have the high level of expertise, education, the best leadership and management attributes to bring the art and science of nursing to produce outcomes for organisations. Implications for nursing management: Nurse executives must remain alert to the ongoing challenges and potential questioning on the value that nurses can bring to an executive board. The framework of nursing executive influence and leadership through professional governance, quality improvement, service transformation and change and shared governance is one possible approach that nurse executives may wish to apply to articulate their contribution and value in remaining at the executive board table. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract: As cities confront increasingly complex governance problems, conceptions of urban governance are becoming progressively more receptive to grasping its dynamic and multiplex nature, its connection to multiple lines of authority and forms of power, and the socio-material assemblages through which it works. Yet, despite conceptual advances around the dynamism and heterogeneity of urban governing assemblages and their durability, much remains to be understood about the processes and devices that compose and cohere their constituent elements to generate governance capacity. We explore this limitation by deploying Foucault’s concept of ‘dispositif’ to analytically characterize how urban governance capacity is achieved around complex urban problems via processes and devices of composition and cohering. We do so by examining an emergent urban energy governance dispositif focused around top-tier commercial office space in Sydney, Australia: a key site around which multiple elements have been composed in a complex, entangled dispositif to produce effective urban governance capacity and accomplish substantive gains in office building energy performance. We characterise the socio-material elements involved and, more particularly, identify and analyse the processes and devices that compose the dispositif and cohere its governance capacity and we draw out the diverse forms of power that are immanent in these processes. These are, we argue, key steps in refining systematic understandings of the contemporary functioning and politics of the distributed urban governance of complex urban challenges. We conclude with key observations suggested by our analysis for urban governance scholarship. © The Author(s) 2020.

Abstract: Major public service reforms are underway at the national level in Australia. The reforms are being implemented progressively over a three-year period. This is the third in a series of articles looking at the implementation of these reforms and focuses on the second stage, which was supposed to be completed in 2015. The author examines the recent report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit which reviewed the development of the ‘Performance Framework’ through a series of public hearings. He explains why, for good governance, particularly in a difficult economic and budgetary climate (domestically and internationally), public interest considerations must prevail, not just in issues about ‘how’ but also about ‘what’ is being actually achieved. There is considerable scope for shared learning and experience across governments and sectors of the economy in any reforms of the public sector. © 2016 CIPFA.

Abstract: Background: The health, social and economic consequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, henceforth COVID-19) pandemic have loomed large as every national government made decisions about how to respond. The 40 Health Systems, COVID-19 (40HS, C-19) study aimed to investigate relationships between governments' capacity to respond (CTR), their response stringency, scope of COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: Data over March and April 2020 were extracted for 40 national health systems on prepandemic government CTR (Global Competitiveness Index), stringency measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker Stringency Index), approach to COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 cases and deaths (Our-World-in-Data). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis were applied to examine latent dimensions and visualize country similarities and dissimilarities. Outcomes were tested using multivariate and one-way analyses of variances and Kruskal-Wallis H tests. Results: The MDS model found three dimensions explaining 91% of the variance and cluster analysis identified five national groupings. There was no association between national governments' prepandemic CTR and the adoption of early stringent public health measures or approach to COVID-19 testing. Two national clusters applied early stringency measures and reported significantly lower cumulative deaths. The best performing national cluster (comprising Australia, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan) adopted relatively early stringency measures but broader testing earlier than others, which was associated with a change in disease trajectory and the lowest COVID-19 death rates. Two clusters (one with high CTR and one low) both adopted late stringency measures and narrow testing and performed least well in COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusion: Early stringency measures and intrinsic national capacities to deal with a pandemic are insufficient. Extended stringency measures, important in the short term, are not economically sustainable. Broad-based testing is key to managing COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).

Abstract: As literature on the ‘shadow state’ shows, the voluntary sector has long served as a necessary conduit through which states orchestrate the governance of various populations. However, relatively little is known about the active role that voluntary organisations play in shaping and mobilising the capacities of the state to advance their own projects and interests. We draw out aspects of post-structural theories of the state, and particularly assemblage thinking, that provide the conceptual and analytical tools with which to explore how voluntary organisations may exceed their common positioning as co-opted by, and subservient to, the state. Through empirical research on homelessness policy development in Australia, we show how locally embedded voluntary organisations in Australia and the United States acted strategically and engaged transnationally – through material practices and multi-sited labours – to create opportunities to shape formal state agenda at national and sub-national levels. The activities and influence of these voluntary organisations are illustrative of the assembled nature of state capacity. © The Author(s) 2019.

Abstract: Purpose: The paper aims to examine one local government’s efforts to increase local-level engagement in building community disaster resilience. Presenting the empirical evidence of stakeholder engagement activities that increase risk awareness and encourage collective action, the study addresses a key priority for the Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (Hyogo Framework for Action 2) to identify methods for increasing local-level implementation of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative, case study approach is used to explore the case in depth. A review of literature from the multidisciplinary areas of communication, social and political theory frames data collection and analysis. Data collection includes observation, document analysis and interviews with policymakers, practitioners and local stakeholders to document achievements and lessons learnt from all perspectives. Findings: Preliminary results indicate that strong political leadership and inter-departmental coordination have contributed to engaging local-level participation in disaster risk reduction in the Municipality of Amadora, Portugal. Findings indicate that the implementation of a wide spectrum of public engagement initiatives has increased awareness of hazard risks amongst specific demographic groups and improved community and government capacity to identify and implement risk reduction strategies. Research limitations/implications: As this study is a work-in-progress and data analysis is in the early stages, interview transcripts included in this paper are limited to members of the team and their Director, Amadora Town Councillor for Civil Protection Services. Practical implications: It is commonly acknowledged that to date, achievements of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2010-2015 largely remain at the national level and have not reached local levels in a substantial manner. Addressing the need for more industry-led research to explore examples of successful stakeholder participation, the paper’s findings can be used by emergency management practitioners who recognise the need to merge climate change adaptation, risk reduction and local-level engagement to encourage public participation, inclusiveness and proactive planning. Originality/value: Co-authored by an Australian academic and a member of Amadora’s Campaign Team, the paper is a combination of empirical data from one city’s practical experience to develop and implement communication strategies in developing and implementing strategies to build community disaster resilience, analysed within a framework of communication, social and political theory. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: New legislation was introduced in 2018 in Victoria, Australia to encourage the negotiation of affordable housing agreements. This change resulted in the expansion of formal and informal mechanisms for cross-sectoral affordable housing delivery. In this paper we draw on 20 interviews with housing stakeholders, focusing on the process of negotiation. We propose a novel theoretical framework to interpret capacity for collective action in a loosely regulated policy area, combining insights from negotiation theory and Institutional Capacity Development (ICD) literature. We find widespread concerns about the opaque, inefficient and potentially exploitative nature of outcomes. We also find that agreements varied across projects based on levels of trust; access to information; political capital; capacity for mutual gain; and the presence of shared rules for interacting. We conclude that competition-based negotiations may lead to increased institutional capacity while also highlighting the challenges of housing delivery in the context of institutional uncertainty. © 2022 IBF, The Institute for Housing and Urban Research.

Abstract: Food security is an issue, not only in developing countries but also in developed economies such as Australia where people from vulnerable groups cannot access affordable and appropriate food on a daily basis. Agencies emphasise the need for collaborative approaches to such complex, multi-sectoral challenges. This article analyses two inter-governmental partnership approaches facilitating local government's response to food insecurity in 12 municipalities within the state of Victoria. We focus on the partnership approaches to collaboration, processes and structures, and collective outcomes. The comparative data analysis from in-depth interviews and document analysis of project-associated materials and municipal policies provides insight into the different partnership approaches. Results suggest that while strategically designed and focused inter-governmental partnerships can build local government capacity to respond to food security, there are systemic, regulatory, and resource barriers in play. In conclusion, the implications of these findings for future inter-governmental approaches to address complex challenges are considered. © 2016 Institute of Public Administration Australia

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The changing institutions of private rental housing: An international review

Abstract: The report This is a report of international comparative research into the institutions of private rental housing and how they are changing. The research was conducted as part of AHURI's Inquiry into The future of the Private Rental Sector (AHURI Inquiry 51120). We take a 'system-embedded' approach to international comparative analysis which considers the particular PRS policy settings and institutions of the reference countries in the context of their housing and wider socio-economic systems. For our international review we looked at the 10 countries (Figure 1), with a detailed review of four (Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom and United States). We took a broad view of 'institutions', to include: • housing and socio-economic system factors, such as housing form, housing markets, household form and economic performance • financial settings, such as housing credit, taxation and subsidies • landlords and managers, both individual persons and large corporations • regulation, with a focus on laws regarding security of tenure and rents. Key findings and policy implications The international comparative literature shows that private rental housing, once regarded as a sector in terminal decline, is now mostly growing and diversifying, changing in some cases rapidly. Conventional typologies put forward in housing research are being overtaken by changes in the PRS and wider housing systems. A rising theme in the literature is the 'financialisation of housing', which refers to the increasing importance of housing in financial markets and the increasing participation of households in finance, particularly through leveraging property ownership for consumption or investment. Studies of PRS regulation indicate a diversity of approaches to questions of rent regulation and security of tenure. From our 10-country survey, and from closer examination of changes in Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), our key findings and their implications for PRS policy development are summarised below. Housing system contexts Private rental housing is the second largest tenure after owner occupation in all but one of the countries we reviewed (only in Germany is the PRS larger). In 7 of the 10 countries, the PRS share is growing, mostly at the expense of owner occupation, and nowhere is it significantly contracting. Wider system contexts-such as population growth, economic growth, house prices and household debt levels-vary across the countries. Germany is exceptional for its extended period of stable house prices; other countries have had booms and some have had booms and busts. In all countries house prices are rising again. Australia is unusual for having had a long escalation in house prices and no recession-and now the highest level of household debt of the 10 countries. In most countries, the profile of the PRS mostly tends towards apartments, small households and lower incomes. In this regard Australia stands out for having a PRS that is less differentiated from the wider Australian housing system than that in most other countries, in terms of building types, household form and household incomes. Policy implications The relatively high degree of resemblance between the profiles of the PRS and wider housing system in Australia implies a high degree of integration, particularly between private rental and owner-occupier markets. Hence, the policy settings and market conditions which apply to one may be transmitted readily to the other. Australian housing policy discussions are usually directed to improving affordability; it would be wise to think also about how to conduct equitable housing policy in a post-crash market. The integration between the Australian PRS and owner-occupied sectors heightens the prospect of investment in both sectors collapsing with little established institutional capacity for counter-cyclical investment that makes necessary additions to supply. The question of managing and relieving housing-related debt involves doing justice not only between creditors and debtors, but between debtor and non-debtor households. Financial settings Across the 10 countries, housing investment is mostly financed by credit, which is mostly provided by banks. Over the past two decades, housing credit has expanded-albeit punctuated by the GFC-with the development of new funding sources. Following the GFC, nine of the countries surveyed have implemented housing-specific macroprudential tools as a financial stability measure. In those countries most affected by the GFC, government programs for the disposal of impaired property-related assets have significantly increased the position of large corporations in the PRS, both directly as landlords (as in the United States) and indirectly as owners of loans with PRS properties pledged. The responses of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States to their financial and housing crises have enabled some existing owner-occupiers and large financial institutions to increase their position in the housing market, though with some curbs around riskier bank lending. This may be no more sustainable or equitable than the pre-GFC housing credit expansion. Looking at the range of tax settings applicable to housing and the PRS, we find some surprising results. Australia and Germany share several settings: both countries exempt owner-occupied housing from capital gains and both provide for negative gearing on similar terms. Yet Australia's and Germany's treatment of negative gearing and capital gains tax underlie quite different housing market outcomes: speculative inflation in Australia; relatively steady housing prices in Germany. In some respects, Australia has stronger settings against speculation: for example, land value tax. Significantly, we identified that eight of the 10 countries have recently introduced or reformed their tax regimes to provide for real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are emerging as a significant vehicle for PRS investment funding. The major form of direct subsidy in the PRS is rent assistance payments. These were made in all 10 countries to tenants-and hence indirectly to their landlords. Some countries also provide specific-purpose subsidies to PRS landlords: Germany provides low-interest loans for energy efficiency modifications and Ireland pays landlords for low-income housing through its Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). The United Kingdom's 'Build to Rent' incentives, which include loan and income guarantees, may be outweighed by its austerity-driven reduction in demand-subsidies paid to low-income tenants, which has significantly reduced the rental revenue base represented by that cohort in recent years. Germany avoided the combined financial and housing crises experienced elsewhere because of a range of institutional factors, including its conservative home lending sector and the withdrawal of some housing subsidies. It may be that some features, such as negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions, have a speculative potential which is active in other contexts, but not in the specific German context of an historically enduring large PRS, low population growth, conservative public financial institutions and rent regulation. In trying to shape the housing outcomes of a growing PRS, Ireland has taken a strategic approach that joins subsidies and regulation. Policy implications Particularly in countries that experienced a housing crash, finance settings have driven rapid change in PRS institutions, often without guidance from conventional housing policy objectives. Macroeconomic policy should look further than its effects on financial system stability or housing market levels to keep in view its effects on housing system institutions and housing policy objectives. This applies not just in responding to crises: for example, the specific effects of housing-related macroprudential tools on the investment strategies and borrowing practices of PRS landlords is worthy of investigation. Of all the policy settings considered in this review, tax settings show best the necessity of considering policy settings in interaction with each other and in wider systemic contexts. It is the interactions which explain how similar tax settings can operate and shape housing outcomes differently: for example, negative gearing facilitating housing speculation in Australia and housing affordability in Germany. Strategy for the PRS should join consideration of finance, taxation, supply and demand-side subsidies and regulation with the objective of making PRS housing outcomes competitive with other sectors. Landlords Smallholding private individuals are the predominant type of landlord in nine countries: only in Sweden are housing companies more common. Most countries, however, also have some large corporate landlords (LCLs), and a few have recently seen rapid growth in very large new LCLs. The origins of LCLs are diverse, but their recent activity has been facilitated by government activities: in Germany, municipal housing privatisation; in the United States and Ireland, post-GFC programs for the disposal of impaired assets. The rising LCLs are not building much rental housing. Rather, they are mostly acquiring existing properties and actively manage their portfolios through renovations, modifications and sales. The LCLs have been active also in mergers and, especially in the United States, in devising new financial instruments. LCLs are often controversial and there is evidence of conflictual relations with tenants, particularly in Germany and the United States. Policy implications 'Institutional landlords'-the LCLs-are now a standing item on the Australian housing policy agenda. Policy makers and stakeholders in the PRS should start specifying what sorts of LCLs are really wanted, and how desired housing outcomes will be delivered. Recent affordable housing policy initiatives have sought to develop community housing providers into a sector of large-scale, mission-oriented landlords. Care should be taken to ensure that these initiatives are not colonised by for-profit LCLs at the expense of affordable housing providers and outcomes. Regulation The view of tenancy regulation as 'red tape' is out of step with the recent experience of most countries in this study. None of the recent growth in the PRS in the countries surveyed has been prompted or unleashed by deregulation (though arguably the United Kingdom's reforms of the late 1980s had such an effect). On the contrary, Ireland and Scotland are examples of successively stronger regulation being implemented as the PRS has grown. Only Spain has recently liberalised its tenancy laws. The foremost approach to assuring tenants' security is to allow landlords to terminate on prescribed grounds only. This is the situation currently in Germany, Sweden, Scotland, most of the Canadian provinces and some major US cities. Only Belgium and Spain rely on long fixed terms and Ireland has a unique regime of cyclical restrictions on termination by landlords. Only Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (other than Scotland) and some US jurisdictions allow termination without grounds. Notably, the State of Victoria in Australia is legislating to remove the provision for termination for no specified reason end the end of the first fixed term of an agreement. Rent increases are regulated in four countries-Belgium, Germany, Spain and Sweden-most of the Canadian provinces and some major US cities by limiting them to a stated guideline or reference rent. Ireland and Scotland do so in designated 'rent pressure zones'. Registers are an old regulatory technology which have been given a new lease of life in several countries with public registers of private landlords, in particular, providing a mechanism for monitoring and lifting standards of conduct. Policy implications The view of tenancy regulation as 'red tape' is out of step with the recent experience of most countries in this study. Smallholding individual landlords and LCLs operate without undue difficulty in more strongly regulated PRSs than Australia's. The use of prescribed grounds for termination is consistent with Australian PRS institutional structures and could be adopted here; similarly, market-related rent regulations (e.g. limitation to guidelines or indices) could operate in combination with conventional Australian tax settings. The extension of registration requirements to mainstream PRS landlords could address some problems posed by smallholding landlords and LCLs, respectively. The study We reviewed international changes in the institutions of private rental housing through three phases of research: • a review of the international comparative literature • a 10-country survey, involving experts in each reference country and follow-up research • analysis of detailed country reports by experts in four countries commissioned for this research. The first phase of our study was a review of the comparative literature and national studies of PRSs around the world. Our review of the literature was ongoing throughout the project with the second and third phases of the study directing our attention to further national-level sources. The second phase was a survey of PRS institutions and change in the 10 countries, including Australia. A questionnaire about PRS institutions and change was devised and sent to experts in the nine international reference countries. Survey responses for Australia were provided as a guide to response formats. The international responses provided a rich source of data and additional resources which we interrogated to identify themes in institutional change for closer examination in the third phase of our research. The third phase comprised closer examination of four countries-Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States-as case studies of the themes in PRS institutional change identified in the literature review and survey. We commissioned four experts-Stefan Kofner (Germany), Aideen Hayden (Ireland), Mark Stephens (UK) and Alex Schwartz (US)-to each write a report on their respective country according to these themes of change, which the research team then used to produce a synthesis analysis of institutional change. The four country reports are appended to this report. © Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute Limited 2018.

Abstract: Public spaces are the loci of complex interactions among multiple stakeholders whose decisions and activities affect places' qualities. The paper builds upon governance theory to provide a holistic in-depth approach in understanding the complexity and quality of the place-shaping processes in public spaces. In the absence of adequate conception of governance in urban design and public spaces, the paper introduces a framework for analysing governance capacity of public spaces and applies the framework to a flagship but highly contested public space in Brisbane, Australia namely South Bank Parklands. The proposed framework encompasses four major components of 1) actors and stakeholders, 2) governance structure, 3) governing tools, and 4) governing tasks. The framework puts special emphasis on the contextual factors, the way public spaces are shaped and governed, and political economy of the space. The case study application showcases the applicability of the PSGF which helps holistically analyse the trends in public space governance structure accounting for the diversity and complexity of all elements involved. The findings reveal that South Bank Parklands governance is mix-structured, hierarchical, and highly political. It is, however, a likeable public space for which civic engagement in the decision-making processes is notably limited. © 2018

Abstract: Our newly constructed index of corporate governance quality (CGQ) provides comprehensive and robust evidence for the association between CGQ and stock liquidity in the pure order-driven Australia market. By using a large sample of 1207 firms from 2001 to 2013, we find a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have greatly improved stock liquidity. Specifically, we find that better governed firms have a lower trading cost, smaller price impacts of trade, and higher trading speed. Moreover, the empirical results reveal that CGQ improves stock liquidity because it is associated with higher information disclosure. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract: In view of past environmental degradation and anticipated climate change impacts, we assessed the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. In a workshop with staff from three Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) who had jurisdiction over three sub-basins, as well as technical experts, nine adaptation options were identified that ranged from environmental flows, restoring river channel habitat, reoperating infrastructure and controlling invasive species. A Catchment Adaptation Framework was developed and used to assess and compare these adaptation options with each of the CMAs, drawing on interviews with their key stakeholders, to identify the risks, benefits and costs. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation can augment catchment management programs and requires investment in a suite of different but complementary measures to lower risk. Our research found institutional challenges in implementing this approach, including the complexities of multi-agency management, constricting legal requirements, narrow funding arrangements, under-developed institutional capacity, difficulties of implementing catchment-scale programs on private property and the need to adhere to community expectations. These institutional issues are ubiquitous internationally and point to the wider issues of providing sufficient management capacity to support adaptation. The Catchment Adaptation Framework presented here enables river basin managers to systematically assess the adaptation options to better inform their decision-making. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: To generate innovative solutions for marine sustainability challenges, scientists, policymakers, and funders are increasingly calling for interdisciplinary research that transcends disciplinary boundaries. However, challenges associated with doing interdisciplinary research persist and undermine progress toward tackling the complex challenges faced by marine social-ecological systems. One barrier for engaging in effective interdisciplinary research is a lack of understanding about the institutional capacities that support interdisciplinary knowledge production. Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with members of the Centre for Marine Socioecology in Australia, we identify five principles that underpin effective interdisciplinary research organizations. The principles are: (1) support female leadership; (2) forge partnerships outside of academia; (3) develop impact-based performance metrics; (4) focus on long-term funding; and (5) cultivate a visible brand. Going forward, these principles could be used to inform organizational design that transforms institutional barriers into enablers of innovative interdisciplinary research for more sustainable, desirable, and equitable futures. © Copyright © 2020 Blythe and Cvitanovic.

Abstract: Digitalization and the use of Smart Farming Technologies are considered a major opportunity for the future of agriculture. However, realisation of full benefits is constrained by: (1) farmers' interest in and use of big data to improve farm decision making; (2) issues of data sovereignty and trust between providers and users of data and technology; (3) institutional arrangements associated with the governance of data platforms. This paper examines the case of Australia's dairy herd milk recording system, arguably one of agriculture's first cases of ‘big data’ use, which collects, analyses and uses farm-level data (milk production, lactation and breeding records) to provide individual cow and herd performance information, used by individual farmers for farm management decisions. The aim of this study was to 1) examine the use of big data to add value to farm decision making; and 2) explore factors and processes, including institutional arrangements, which influence farmer engagement with and use of big data. This paper traces the Australian history of the organisation of dairy herd recording (established in 1912 and digitalized in late 1970s) and then uses findings from a longitudinal study of 7 case study dairy farms, which were incentivised to become involved in herd recording in 2015. Applying a conceptual framework linking path dependency in farm decision making and collaborative governance capacity, we find three new important dimensions of the farm user context influencing farmer demand for big data applications: 1) the transition to a new business stage; 2) the additionality farmers seek from data generated in one component of the farm system to other subsystems, and 3) the use of data in long term or strategic decision making. Further, we identified critical attributes of support services in addressing digital literacy, capacity and capability issues at farm level, including diversity in data presentation formats and facilitation of the on-farm transition process through intermediary herd test organisations. The role of farmers as governance actors, or citizens in the decisions of the trajectory of big data applications, adds to understanding of the nature of collaborative governance arrangements that support farm engagement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: Urban partnerships are an instrument of urban governance common in major urban development projects. However, the potential for these traditional urban policy instruments to promote climate-adapted greenfield development remains largely untested. This study examines this potential through an analysis of four urban development partnerships for master-planned estates in two rapidly urbanising regions of Australia. We interview private property developers, government land organisations and municipal level actors. The analysis focuses on the convergence, and tensions, between partners' goals of affordability, profitability and sustainability; benefits and risks of partnering; and, the management of assets over time, in light of environmental risks. The partnerships studied contributed to the state's capacity to implement policy efficiently, encourage innovation and de-risk projects for private partners. However, these initiatives also transferred longer term environmental risks to the broader planning system and to non-partners. The central role of the state in coordinating these arrangements presents opportunities to redress these limitations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

Abstract: Using an index of corporate governance quality (CGQ), we provide the first robust evidence of the determinants of stock liquidity in Australia. We assume that CGQ affects stock liquidity because effective governance decreases information asymmetries between insiders (e.g. managers) and outsiders (e.g. investors), as well as among outsiders, by improving information transparency of a firm. Consistent with agency theory, this study, using 435 large capitalization firms over the period from 2001 to 2008, finds a significant positive relationship between CGQ and stock liquidity, suggesting that better governed firms have a higher level of stock liquidity. These findings are robust to alternative proxies of CGQ, stock liquidity and endogeneity bias. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract: Vietnamese ‘blue boats’ – small wooden-hulled fishing boats – are now entering the territorial waters of Pacific Island countries and illegally catching high-value species found on remote coastal reefs. Crossing several international boundaries and traversing a distance of over 5000 km, these intrusions have alarmed Oceanic countries, including Australia. Lacking administrative capacity as well as jurisdictional authority to effectively control the vast stretches of island coastlines individually, governments and intergovernmental bodies in the region have called for strengthened coordination of surveillance efforts while also pressuring Vietnam diplomatically. This paper reviews these latest developments and is the first to provide a focused assessment of the issue. Through the lens of Copenhagen School of securitisation theory, we analyse responses of national and regional actors and their portrayal in online media to understand how blue boats are constructed as a security threat within a narrative of maritime, food and human security. Arguably, Australia together with the Forum Fisheries Agency, who advise on the governance of offshore tuna resources, have so far acted most decisively – in a way that might see them extend their strategic role in the region. We propose a comprehensive empirical research agenda to better understand and manage this nascent, flammable and largely unpredictable inter-regional phenomenon. © 2019 The Authors.

Abstract: This article analyses expectations and experiences of digital public spaces that facilitate community engagement with urban planning. While viewing digital spaces as part of an expanding repertoire of public spaces and events – physical and digital – that signify theparticipatory turn in municipal governance, we argue that local officials and residents are overly optimistic about the democratic and administrative capacities of the digital sphere. Through a case study from Melbourne, Australia – a city with significant growth pressures – we argue that the experience of new participatory digital platforms falls short of expectations, for both residents and officials. Data show that well-documented problems with established modes of community engagement such as agenda control and ‘black boxing’ of responses, are replicated in on-line settings. The wariness residents have of administrators and elected officials are overlaid by new concerns of digital distrust and digital exclusion. For officials, using these digital spaces effectively requires time to develop and apply new skills. Our study suggests that digital spaces are not homogenous but are made up of diverse and complex practices and interrelationships The multiplex relationships making up these digital spaces suggest that strategic and contextual combinations of online and offline engagement may be a path towards inclusive and democratic community engagement. © 2021, Articulo - Journal of Urban Research.

Australia’s drug safety governance has the characteristics of large information sharing channels,increasing the transparency of government work,carrying out targeted education and enhancing the governance capacity of participants etc. It has achieved significant improvement in the occurrence of drug recall events,and significant increase in the satisfaction of stakeholders in the communication activities of drug regulatory authorities. In contrast,the participation consciousness and ability of relevant entities in China are still not strong,and the system to ensure the participation of these entities is not yet sound. It is recommended that China should pay more attention to the communication between the upper and lower levels of governments,conduct targeted education or training for principals of non-government entities, implement the policy consultation rights of non-government entities, as well as guide self-discipline based on self-management ability of industry entities so as to initially establish drug safety governance system in China,and enhance the governance efficiency. © 2020 Editorial Office of China Pharmacy.

Abstract: Responsibility for solving collective action problems in invasive species control has conventionally been assigned to government. The large continuing costs arising from invasive species demonstrate the limitations of government-centred (monocentric) approaches to governance in this domain, and indicate a need for polycentric alternatives which complement government capacities with those of landholders and their community organisations. We sought to add to existing knowledge about collective action problems for invasive species management, and to explore the potential for community-based, polycentric approaches to improve management in this domain, through workshops and a survey of landholders regarding the weed serrated tussock (Nassella trichotoma) in two regions of New South Wales, Australia. Serrated tussock threatens the private interests of a substantial proportion of landholders in the two regions. Private landholders recognise how management of this weed on their own properties poses a collective action problem, where success is dependent on the diligent control efforts of neighbouring private and public landholders. They are more likely to consider issues relating to horizontal social capital (e.g. relationships with public and private neighbours) as barriers to effective serrated tussock control on their own property, than issues relating to information and education about this species. Community-based approaches to this weed have the potential to improve its management across the landscape, and a great majority of private landholders appear willing to participate in such a program. Such an approach will require the active participation of public land managers, continued coercion of non-cooperative landholders, and can be developed from the foundation of existing institutional arrangements for land management, taking into account unique regional relationships and characteristics. It should complement and build on, rather than replace existing legislative, research, and extension approaches. © 2016.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The approaching pilot for One Health governance index

Abstract: Background: One Health approach advocates realizing the best health and harmonious symbiosis of human, animal and natural environment through cross-border, multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation. The good governance model is the leading factor for the performance of One Health governance. In order to tackle the complex problems in the One Health governance at the global level, the variation of One Health governance in different countries was analyzed by a set of indicators within the One Health system. Method: The capacity of One Health governance was assessed after establishment of a set of indicators for the One Health governance index (OHGI) following the methodology of the global One Health index. The data to calculate OHGI was collected from various database sources, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and official health-related institutions of various countries. Eight indicators (including 19 sub-indicators) were employed in the OHGI system to comprehensively evaluate the capacity of One Health governance in 146 countries of the world. Results: Among the 146 countries scored in the OHGI system, the average score was 34.11, with a median score of 31.49, ranged from 8.50 to 70.28. Most countries with higher OHGI scores come from Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific and North America, while countries with the lower OHGI scores are almost from sub-Saharan Africa. Six countries scored more than 65 points, including Australia, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, the United States of America and Finland, indicating that these countries are relatively mature in most aspects of One Health governance. However, there were some developing countries with OHGI scored lower than 15. Therefore, the gap between countries with higher OHGI scores and those with lower OHGI scores is more than 60. Conclusions: Good governance on One Health is an important indicator to measure One Health’s governance capacity. The political stability, the level of rule of law and economic conditions in different regions are significantly correlated with the One Health governance capacity. Actions need to be taken urgently to close the gap of One Health governance between different regions. © 2023, The Author(s).

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Evaluation of a hospital-based integrated model of eye care for diabetic retinopathy assessment: A multimethod study

Abstract: Objectives Diabetic eye disease is a leading cause of blindness but can be mitigated by regular eye assessment. A framework of issues, developed from the literature of barriers to eye assessment, was used to structure an examination of perceptions of a new model of care for diabetic retinopathy from the perspective of staff using the model, and health professionals referring patients to the new service. Design Multimethod: interviews and focus groups, and a separate survey. Setting A new clinic based on an integrated model of care was established at a hospital in outer metropolitan Sydney, Australia in 2017. Funded jointly by Centre for Eye Health (CFEH) and the hospital, the clinic was equipped and staffed by optometrists who work alongside the ophthalmologists in the existing hospital eye clinic. Participants Five (of seven) hospital staff working in the clinic (ophthalmologists and administrative officers) or referring to it from other departments (endocrinologists); nine optometrists from CFEH who developed or worked in the clinic; 10 community-based optometrists as potential referrers. Results The new clinic was considered to have addressed known barriers to eye assessment, including access, assistance for patients unable/unwilling to organise eye checks and efficient management of human resources. The clinic optimised known drivers of this model of care: providing clear scope of practice and protocols for shared care between optometrists and ophthalmologists, good communication between referrers and eye professionals and a collegial approach promoting interprofessional trust. Remaining areas of concern were few referrals from general practitioners, fewer referrals from hospital endocrinologists than expected and issues with stretched administrative capacity. There were also perceived mismatches between the priorities of hospital management and aims of the clinic. Conclusions The new model was considered to have addressed many of the barriers to assessment. While there remain issues with the model, there were also unexpected benefits. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Abstract: Understanding citizens’ use and trust in media are essential during a global health crisis when governments need to provide reliable information to enact public measures to reduce rates of illness and death. This chapter examines these relationships through repeated surveys in two comparable liberal democracies, the USA and Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It finds that news engagement increased markedly in both countries in 2020 during the pandemic with television and newspapers being the most relied upon sources. Media trust was higher for citizens who prioritized established news sources and medical experts for coronavirus information. Yet, there is clear evidence that people’s news preferences are associated with their level of concern about the virus and support for government measures to contain it. Trump supporters were more inclined to trust information from family and friends on social media than from professional journalists. They were the group least concerned about catching the virus and most dissatisfied with government lockdown measures. The chapter finds greater political and media polarization and partisan distrust of experts in the USA compared to Australia. It concludes that polarization has serious real-world consequences for governments’ capacities to protect public health in this time of crisis. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Peter Van Aelst and Jay G.

Abstract: Indicator-based frameworks for assessing the sustainability of commercial fisheries have become well-established in the consumer sector. Within fisheries management, there are only a few jurisdictions, notably Australia, where sustainability frameworks are regularly used across the full spectrum of management functions, including planning, decision making, and evaluation. In Canada, a “sustainable fisheries framework” has been proposed but implementation has been limited to date. The Canadian Fisheries Research Network (CFRN), a six-year collaboration between Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the commercial fishing industry, and academic institutions, included as one of its major outputs the development of a comprehensive framework-based approach to evaluate the sustainability of commercial fisheries in Canada. Although most fisheries sustainability frameworks focus on the ecological domain, the CFRN explicitly recognized the social, economic, and institutional domains as having equal importance in a holistic treatment of sustainability. Following an iterative research and development process, a subgroup within the CFRN produced a novel sustainability indicator framework that combines a hierarchical subject matter structure consisting of domains, dimensions, and elements with a formula approach to developing indicators that utilizes a system of variables, or attributes. These two aspects of the sustainability indicator framework are linked in a way that helps to enforce comprehensive and routine methods for identifying objectives and relating those to specific indicators. The careful balancing of scope and depth makes for a powerful tool that can be used across a range of fisheries management contexts within Canada and in other jurisdictions that have a similar governance structure and high degree of institutional capacity. We present a detailed account of how the sustainability indicator framework was developed, the logic of its construction, and its potential application in fisheries management. © 2019 by the author(s).

Abstract: Highlights: What explains variation in the energy-related climate policies that nations implement? In this paper we present a theory of energy-related climate policy in democratic countries, emphasizing the distributional effects of policies on important energy-related industries, public sentiment, and the institutional capacity of governments, in determining energy-related climate policies implemented cross-nationally. As to the form of the policy, we expect the government to favor regulatory instruments over fiscal policies (taxes, subsidies) when it has enough institutional capacity in the relevant public agencies. For empirical evidence, we analyze national climate policies in four industrialized democracies: Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United States. © 2015.

Abstract: Australian local government does not enjoy the status of its counterparts in comparable democracies and has long sought acknowledgment in the federal constitution. As these campaigns have consistently failed, this study considers how, and in which forms, local government obtains its own political legitimacy within a governance system centered on the citizen–state relationship, in addition to evaluating the relationships between the different forms of legitimacy. We find that positive perceptions of local government effectiveness are associated with higher levels of support for constitutional change, but that local governments need to pay more attention to systems of accountability and oversight, how building and planning issues are handled, and how they communicate with residents. Generally, and unsurprisingly, local government is appreciated more by those who rely on their services yet who are not always the loudest voices in public debates. Constitutional legitimacy is more likely when other sources of legitimacy are enhanced.

Abstract: Bordering practices have been a central and controversial feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Closed borders, lockdowns, and restrictions on movement and individual "freedoms”have revived concepts of the biopo- litical "state of exception”and state control. In this article, we argue that biopolitical critiques of responses to the pandemic fail to grasp the op- portunity to rethink worldmaking and instead base their critiques on a desired "return to normal”which foregrounds human-centric individual- ism at the expense of alternative worldmaking that accounts for the more- than-human. To do so, we bring the virus and the virome into our discus- sion to rethink bordering practices and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects bodies, worlds, and politics. We focus primarily on the Australian case, where the pandemic response began with lockdowns and then gave way to a militarized and individualistic approach. Responses to the pandemic have failed to produce a reimagining of human and more-than-human re- lations. Opportunities for ethical engagement have been missed, resulting in limited responses that stem from the failure of state capacity and en- trenched modes of inequality that are harmful to vulnerable others, both human and more-than-human. This requires an ontological reframing of how we relate to a complex world from a more-than-human perspective. © The Author(s) (2024).

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Connecting land-use and water planning: Prospects for an urban water metabolism approach

Abstract: The current fabric of urban areas is largely the result of past land development and land-use planning decisions. Historically, there was relatively little consideration of the impact of these decisions upon hydrological systems within and outside urban areas. Despite their close relationship, urban and regional planning and water resources management have typically been carried out separately and guided by different institutional arrangements. The range of impacts of urbanisation on hydrological systems at the city-region scale, and the dependence of urbanised areas upon these systems, call for better integration between the sectors of urban and regional planning and water resources management to ensure the sustainability and resilience of cities and their regions to future changes and uncertainties. This paper evaluates the extent to which planning mechanisms currently support integration between land-use and water resource sectors. The evaluation draws on a comparative analysis of 113 statutory and non-statutory planning mechanisms in three Australian capital city-regions: South East Queensland, and the Melbourne and Perth Metropolitan regions. Results indicate that the function of water at the city-region scale, including its role in supporting environmental connectivity, needs to be better understood and considered by land-use planning systems; improved institutional capacity is required to enable both sectors to deal with future changes and uncertainties related to water resources; and emergent planning trends supportive of the consideration of water connectivity at the city-region scale are yet to be fully implemented. Based on the results, the paper concludes by exploring how the concept of urban metabolism may facilitate better integration between the two sectors, along with the identification of best suited planning mechanisms and needed changes in governance and institutional arrangements conducive to integration. © 2016

Abstract: The purpose of this article was to explore the impacts of climate change on human health in Australia in general, and the state of Queensland in particular. We evaluated health-related services and adaptation challenges in the health sector and indicate possible remedies. The scientific consensus on the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is convincing. Climate change will have potentially devastating human health effects including increased morbidity, mortality and injury in the near future. Its impacts will be unevenly distributed among geographical regions and population groups. The elderly, children and people who are chronically ill and economically disadvantaged will be more vulnerable than others. Adaptation is a valuable tool for minimizing the effects of climate change on human health, but the mechanisms involve various societal, cultural, economic, political, environmental, information and technological challenges that need to be addressed rigorously and cautiously. Developing and designing appropriate healthcare systems to meet the challenges involved with adaptation is equally important in reducing the health effects of climate variability. There is an increased need for information about climatic impacts on human health and a need to increase institutional capacity, social and human capital, leadership, communication and partnerships as well as promoting stakeholders’ engagement in the adaptation processes in order to ensure success. © Inter-Research 2020

Abstract: Rapid urban population growth promotes the outward expansion of cities and strengthens demand for outer metropolitan infrastructure. In a practical sense, creating sustainable greenfield communities is problematic given the expensive, multidimensional nature of infrastructure. Inwardly-looking metropolitan imaginaries can result. Although urban political economy perspectives acknowledge variability in local public-private sector relations, thereby raising the prospect of developer obligations, the latter are not without limited. To further strengthen understanding of sub-national government capacities and outer metropolitan infrastructure policy, additional institutionalist interpretations are necessary. Alongside or in between the limits of developer contributions and ad hoc public funding streams, this paper confirms the importance of extended policy perspectives by identifying and evaluating three state level policy responses on the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia: spatially designated funding, public private partnerships (PPPs) and community infrastructure brokers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the experience and involvement of academics in learning analytics (LA) due to its potential for improving teaching and learning. However, findings often reflect an educational culture which is indicative of the institutional or national context where the study has occurred, resulting in bias regarding LA perspectives. Therefore, this study seeks to compare and contrast the experiences of LA among academics in Australia and Malaysia, with intentions to learn from each other's experience. Areas of comparison were: (1) academics' involvement in LA activities; (2) academics' responses to the institutional capacity in supporting LA; and 3) academics' concerns about the ethical issues surrounding LA. A survey of 353 Australian and 224 Malaysian academics revealed similarities and differences. It is evident from these results that the context and infrastructure for LA are at different stages of development in both countries. Nevertheless, the results provide an interesting reflection on academics' needs, institutional understanding, policies, and educational cultural biases in applying LA in teaching and learning in higher education institutions. © 2018 Australasian Journal of Educational Technology.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Broadening Experimentation through Research-Industry Collaboratives in the Australian Water Sector

Abstract: Whether urban climate experimentation is productive for climate-resilient sustainability transitions is determined by the extent to which experimentation provides impulses to radical change that are embedded in and strategically connected with on-going policy and planning processes, thus building on and boosting new governance capacities. We analyse the transformative and orchestrating capacities manifest in the urban climate experimenting processes in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Transformative capacity enables developing and embedding novelty. Orchestrating capacity serves to coordinate multi-actor processes to facilitate and align experimentation. While actors in Rotterdam are successfully employing experimentation as a new governance mode to address climate change, sustainability and resilience, this approach is mainly legitimised by marketing the city internationally as a frontrunner in climate adaptation. As a result, individual innovations remain stand-alone initiatives. We can identify several capacity gaps, which point to mismatches between experimentation and on-going policy and planning processes, as well as across (strategic and operational) governance levels. © Cambridge University Press 2018.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of CEO incentive-based compensation on earnings management, taking into account the influence of institutional settings and corporate governance systems. Design/methodology/approach: Using archival data of 3,000 British, Australian, German, and Austrian firm-years between 2005 and 2014, the study applies fixed-effect estimator to reduce risks of endogeneity bias. Findings: The findings reveal that institutional factors influence the relationship between CEO incentive-based compensation and earnings management. Particularly, firms from countries within the Anglo-American model (the UK and Australia), which provide greater protection for investor, stricter legal enforcement, and higher quality of corporate governance, tend to have lower level of earnings management. However, besides corporate governance quality, it is relevant to consider weaker investor protection and legal enforcement to motivate earnings management in firms from countries within the Euro-Continental model (Germany and Austria). Originality/value: The study suggests that robust implementation of corporate governance, derived from either model, helps in restraining CEO opportunistic behavior. Importantly, more qualified institutions have higher impact on the relative adequacy of CEO incentive-based pay formulas in mitigating earnings management concerns. This can be extended by future research through comparative studies using other contexts or influential institutions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss is one of the most significant drivers of ecosystem change and is projected to continue at a rapid rate. While protected areas, such as national parks, are seen as important refuges for biodiversity, their effectiveness in stemming biodiversity decline has been questioned. Public agencies have a critical role in the governance of many such areas, but there are tensions between the need for these agencies to be more “adaptive” and their current operating environment. Our aim is to analyze how institutions enable or constrain capacity to conserve biodiversity in a globally significant cross-border network of protected areas, the Australian Alps. Using a novel conceptual framework for diagnosing biodiversity institutions, our research examined institutional adaptive capacity and more general capacity for conserving biodiversity. Several intertwined issues limit public agencies’ capacity to fulfill their conservation responsibilities. Narrowly defined accountability measures constrain adaptive capacity and divert attention away from addressing key biodiversity outcomes. Implications for learning were also evident, with protected area agencies demonstrating successful learning for on-ground issues but less success in applying this learning to deeper policy change. Poor capacity to buffer political and community influences in managing significant cross-border drivers of biodiversity decline signals poor fit with the institutional context and has implications for functional fit. While cooperative federalism provides potential benefits for buffering through diversity, it also means protected area agencies have restricted authority to address cross-border threats. Restrictions on staff authority and discretion, as public servants, have further implications for deploying capacity. This analysis, particularly the possibility of fostering “ambidexterity” —creatively responding to political pressures in a way that also achieves a desirable outcome for biodiversity conservation—is one promising way of building capacity to buffer both political influences and ecological pressures. The findings and the supporting analysis provide insight into how institutional capacity to conserve biodiversity can be enhanced in protected areas in Australia and elsewhere, especially those governed by public agencies and/or multiple organizations and across jurisdictions. © 2016 by the author(s).

Abstract: Climate change is the greatest global health threat of the 21st century, with numerous direct and indirect human health consequences. Local governments play a critical role in communities’ response to climate change, both through strategies to reduce emissions and adaption plans to respond to changing climate and extreme weather events. Australian local government environmental health officers (EHOs) have the relevant skills and expertise to inform and develop adaptation plans for health protection in the context of climate change. This study used an online survey followed by phone interviews of local government management to determine the extent to which EHOs are involved in adaptation planning in health protection climate change plans. Questions were also asked to determine whether local councils are aware of EHOs’ capability to contribute and to gauge the willingness of management to provide EHOs with the workload capacity to do so. The findings demonstrated that although climate adaptation and mitigation planning is occurring in local government, it is not including or considering the public health impacts on the community. Primarily, it was found that this oversight was due to a lack of awareness of the health impacts of climate change outside of a disaster or emergency scenario. Currently, EHOs are an untapped source of knowledge and skills that can contribute to climate change adaption planning. To support this, a framework of local environmental health practice was developed to assist the reconceptualization of the scope of practice required for the planning and response to climate change. © 2023 by the authors.

Abstract: Introduction The delivery of services to improve Aboriginal health and well-being must centre culture and integrate a social and emotional well-being understanding and approaches. These approaches are essential in increasing access to, and engagement with, health services, as well as ensuring culturally safe, person-centred and community-centred care. This study will evaluate the Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia's social and emotional well-being model of service being piloted in five Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services across five of Western Australia's regions. The model of service includes the establishment of interdisciplinary social and emotional well-being teams and a four-pillar approach to service delivery. Methods and analysis An Aboriginal Participatory Action Research methodology will be undertaken which calls for Indigenous leadership and governance, capacity-building of community co-researchers and engagement in reflexive practice. The evaluation will take a mixed-methods approach to data collection, including at each pilot site, yarns with up to five clients engaging with social and emotional well-being services; qualitative interviews with up to five service providers at each site, and up to five key knowledge holders from stakeholders including funders and commissioning bodies; the collection of clinical data; facilitated discussion using the social and emotional well-being Systems Assessment Tool; and document analysis and cost-estimation. Analysis will be guided by a client journey mapping framework, and data will be collectively analysed through a socioecological framework to understand the connections and inter-relatedness between client outcomes and experiences, social and emotional well-being team and service provider experiences, service systems and governance structures. Ethics and dissemination This evaluation was approved by the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (HREC1204). The findings will be disseminated through the production of an evaluation report and academic publications and presentations. Findings will also be disseminated through community forums and plain language summaries. These outputs will detail evaluation findings and recommendations, the process of evaluation through an Aboriginal Participatory Action Research approach and the collaborative stakeholder relationship-building that underpinned the project.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Towards institutional fit? The reality of institutional capacity through two food security exemplars

Abstract: Global challenges face many local governments, which in turn, need to rapidly build their capacity to respond. Local government requires alignment with organizational partners, higher levels of government, external societal actors and local constituents, through the concept of institutional fit, to acquire the capacity to respond to global challenges. Institutional fit discursively enables local government to increase its reach and collective capacity. We analysed institutional fit in two local government case studies in Australia that aimed to improve food security through addressing equity and other social aspects to the challenge. Case study analysis was based on in-depth interviews, primary document analysis and secondary data analysis pertaining to the food security initiatives. Findings show that collaborative partnerships can provide greater understanding of the goals, roles and higher-level commitment needed for institutional fit. Aligning capacities and roles between and within organizations and institutions is also required because local government is severely restricted without whole-of-institutional commitment to similar goals. We found, however, that local government is constrained in its response to change because of the complex nature of the challenge and because neoliberalism militates against fit within the wider domain of the entire institutional response. We argue that institutional fit needs to be embedded within any change process. More nuanced and targeted understandings of the roles of each organization can then be understood, along with the role of power within the institutional domain, so that appropriate planning occurs to identify and target which responses are achieved and by whom. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: The Australian government's response to the Millennium Drought (1997–2010) has been met with praise and contestation. While proponents saw the response as timely and crucial, critics claimed it was characterized by government overreach and mismanagement. Five months of field research in farm communities in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) identified two dominant discourses: administrative rationalism and a local community-based discourse I have termed community-centrism. Administrative rationalism reflects the value of scientific inquiry in service to the state and is the dominant research-based problem-solving model used by water and natural resource agencies (Dryzek in The politics of the earth: environmental discourses, Oxford University Press, 2013; Colloff and Pittock in Aust J Water Resour, 23(2):88–98, 2019). Community-centrism was identified through discussions with farmers and represents a bottom-up approach to environmental planning and management that seeks to incorporate local knowledge, planning, and direct participation. This investigation reveals how discourses define problems and policy choices. While market-based government interventions were likely necessary to address the crisis in the MDB, community-centred responses could have enhanced the government’s capacity to respond to problems. This paper argues that the long-term sustainability of water management in the Basin will require a reorientation on the part of farmers, academics, and governments to develop a community-centred approach to water policies impacting agriculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

Abstract: Dam failures that cause significant adverse downstream impacts continue to occur globally. Hence, effective, adequately resourced dam safety regulation is critical for the safety of dams and downstream communities. This paper explores options for regulatory funding and resourcing according to a selected set of relevant key factors along a continuum of dam safety assurance. An international comparative analysis of 15 jurisdictional case studies against the key factors identifies trends representing indicative precedents. A procedure is developed to help identify increasingly relevant precedents for guiding target jurisdictions on potentially suitable options. Illustrative application to a real case in Australia is provided. © The work of John Pisaniello and Joanne Tingey-Holyoak is © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Abstract: Innovative design labs were created by public authorities of the USA, Australia, Singapore, Finland, Canada, the UK, Switzerland, Denmark, China, and other countries to accelerate changes and develop modern public service. This paper provides further insight to establishing external innovation accelerators for strengthening capacity of public institutions. The study aims to define the development opportunities for innovative design labs for the public sector in Ukraine's regions by the case of the Laboratory of Intellectual Development for Empowering Regions (LIDER). The study was conducted at two stages: (1) exploring the features of innovation implementation in the public sector and outlining the main problems of innovation capacity of public institutions; (2) defining the development opportunities for the LIDER via SWOTanalysis. To substantiate the study results, the correlation analysis between autocratic, bureaucratic, competitive, self-protective, and participative leadership behaviors of CEOs and innovation index based on data from 18 countries was performed, as well as a survey of 195 public servants of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine and an interview of 9 experts were conducted. The following key development opportunities for the LIDER were detected: Promoting the introduction of incremental innovations in public institutions by using design thinking methodology; assisting the development of pro-innovative culture and participative leadership via individual-centric and system-oriented approaches; developing effective tools for performance management and supporting public institutions in project activity; organizing the competitions for regional innovative projects; assisting in creation of radically human systems in public institutions. © Dmytro Dzvinchuk, Mariana Orliv, Brigita Janiunaite, Victor Petrenko, 2021.

Abstract: Background: Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are increasing worldwide. This is especially paramount in low and middle income countries in which ESRD patients are struggling to access specialist services e.g. hemodialysis (HD). Benchmarking analysis of the offered healthcare packages in several countries and comparison of the utilized alternative healthcare models for ESRD patients may be auspicious for institutional capacity-building in the existing healthcare facilities. Main aim of this study was to perform a benchmarking and evidence-informed gap analysis of the ESRD care provision in Iran and recognize the gaps that cause diversification in care quality for ESRD patients that hinder efforts for care quality improvement in the Iranian National Healthcare System. Methods: Dimensions of the Australian Anglicare Southern Queensland Clinical and Care Governance Framework (ASQCGF) were utilized as corner stones of a comprehensive clinical care plan that is essential in responding to HD patients’ needs in Iran. An extensive literature search was performed at the next stage to recognize the gold standard core elements. The ascertained components were assigned to the five separate dimensions of the ASQCGF and a preliminary draft (comprehensive package of care for HD patients) was prepared. A checklist was developed at a later stage which was sent to a panel of expert consisting professional healthcare providers in nephrology and hemodialysis wards for their opinions. A gap analysis was conducted to evaluate current care processes of the Iranian HD patients align with the elements of the gold standard framework. Results: The identified deficits were classified in five areas in accord with the elements of ASQCGF as follow: A) supply of resources, medical devices and equipment support B) recruitment and endorsement of clinics and general work force C) infection prevention and controlling procedures D) care effectiveness monitoring and quality improvement E) provision of safe environment for both HD patients and hospitals’ staff. Conclusions: The study findings revealed considerable gaps in providing quality HD services to the Iranian HD patients that herald their therapeutic unmet needs and the shift that is needed to narrow down the widening organizational failure which fuels the current disenchantment among the both healthcare providers and HD patients. © The Author(s) 2024.

Abstract: How does local experience of climate change alter voters' policy preferences and voting decisions? After exposure to a climate disaster, voters may elect politicians prioritising robust disaster prevention policies, or conversely, immediate economic relief. In turn, elected representatives will either mitigate or exacerbate the severity of future climate events. In this study, I leverage a climate event with a high degree of local geographic variation – a pre-election drought in Australia – to see how it shaped political beliefs and behaviours in 2019. Using a longitudinal panel survey, I show that voters in drought-exposed areas increasingly prioritised individual economic security, rather than broader climate-mitigation policies. Moreover, I find that regional micro-parties in drought-affected regions gained vote share. In other words, voters at the front-lines of climate change sought out immediate and local economic relief. Unless local politicians can propose climate policies with short-term economic benefits, disasters may limit governments' capacities to pursue long-term climate resilience. © 2021

Abstract: In this article, we reveal the nature and effects of data infrastructures on the authorisation of data that represent students and educational practitioners, including how such data can misrepresent and govern educational policy and practices in sometimes problematic ways. To better understand the governance capacities of data infrastructures, we draw upon notions of discursive practices and materiality, and apply these to a specific school management system, OneSchool, in Queensland, Australia. We show how data infrastructures both promote and impede educational practitioners’ use of data in decision making and daily practices. This includes precluding information about students’ (positive) behaviours and omitting important enrolment information about students’ Indigenous languages. By doing so, we show how data infrastructures govern in ways that authorise the preclusion and omission of data, thereby representing students and schooling. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Abstract: Background: Workplace violence prevalence has attracted significant attention within the international nursing literature. Little attention to non-mental health settings and a lack of evaluation rigor have been identified within review literature. Objectives: To examine the effects of a workplace violence training program in relation to risk assessment and management practices, de-escalation skills, breakaway techniques, and confidence levels, within an acute hospital setting. Design: A quasi-experimental study of nurses using pretest-posttest measurements of educational objectives and confidence levels, with two week follow-up. Setting: A 440 bed metropolitan tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants: Nurses working in specialties identified as a ‘high risk’ for violence. Method: A pre-post-test design was used with participants attending a one day workshop. The workshop evaluation comprised the use of two validated questionnaires: the Continuing Professional Development Reaction questionnaire, and the Confidence in Coping with Patient Aggression Instrument. Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. The paired t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of changes in the clinical behaviour intention and confidence scores from pre- to post-intervention. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated to determine the extent of the significant results. Results: Seventy-eight participants completed both pre- and post-workshop evaluation questionnaires. Statistically significant increases in behaviour intention scores were found in fourteen of the fifteen constructs relating to the three broad workshop objectives, and confidence ratings, with medium to large effect sizes observed in some constructs. A significant increase in overall confidence in coping with patient aggression was also found post-test with large effect size. Conclusions: Positive results were observed from the workplace violence training. Training needs to be complimented by a multi-faceted organisational approach which includes governance, quality and review processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: This study examines the role of resource abundance in the cross-country differences in the impacts of the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008–2009. Using forecasts from the unobserved components model and exponential smoothing technique, we estimate the output levels a country would reach in 2009 and 2013 in the absence of the GFC, and compare these with the realised output levels. We find large variations in the output losses across 72 countries. The mineral-rich countries have been found to be in a strong position to survive any adverse shocks stemming from the GFC. Income per capita, trade openness, and institutional quality and government effectiveness are also found to be key factors determining the differences in output loss in the post-crisis period. These findings have strong implications for resource-rich countries such as Australia and are expected to shed new light on alternative policy designs and appropriate strategies to deal with any future economic crisis. © 2019 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.

Abstract: Using an online panel, we surveyed a representative sample of 500 each in Australia and New Zealand during July 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. We find trust in government has increased dramatically, with around 80% of respondents agreeing government was generally trustworthy. Around three quarters agreed management of the pandemic had increased their trust in government. Over 85% of respondents have confidence that public health scientists work in the public interest. Testing four hypotheses, we find that income and education predict trust in government and confidence in public health scientists, as does voting for the political party in government. Trust in government and confidence in public health scientists strongly predict Covid-19 phone application use, largely through convincing people the App is beneficial. Trust in government then is both an outcome and antecedent of government effectiveness. Building trust is important for governments implementing difficult policy responses during a crisis. © 2021 Institute of Public Administration Australia

Abstract: The escalating environmental crisis and pressing water resource conservation issues globally necessitate comprehensive research. This study investigates urban green space regulations and water resource conservation challenges in Indonesia and Australia. Employing a comparative analysis, it examines the legal frameworks, policies, and implementations in both countries. The research aims to identify innovative and sustainable strategies for water resource protection. Findings reveal substantial disparities in regulatory approaches, public involvement, and the integration of green technologies in green space management between the two nations. Indonesia needs help enhancing institutional capacity and integrating green space policies into urban planning, while Australia focuses on climate change adaptation and sustainable water resource management. The study advocates cross-sectoral collaboration and ecosystem principles in green space regulations for practical water conservation objectives. It contributes fresh perspectives on legal and policy frameworks for addressing water resource conservation challenges through urban green space management, offering recommendations for cohesive and sustainable policy development. © 2024, Lembaga Contrarius Indonesia.

Abstract: Developing and nurturing resilience is critical to the social and emotional wellbeing (SEWB) of Indigenous Australian adolescents and their continuing life trajectories. The attendance of many Indigenous adolescents from remote communities at boarding schools creates a need to prioritise and proactively create opportunities that build and nurture student resilience. This requires sustainable and multi-dimensional school-wide approaches. Despite this need, there are no documented SEWB or resilience building approaches for Australian Indigenous students who attend boarding schools. We describe the use of participatory action research to develop and implement a two-year STEP-UP intervention with boarding schools, designed to create supportive environments for improving psychosocial resilience and wellbeing of remote-living Indigenous students. The intervention consisted of three components implemented annually across eight schools: a site-specific STEP-UP action plan; staff capacity development; and an annual Schools and Communities Conference. Thematic analysis of a systematic literature review, documented action planning, conference group processes, resilience theory and survey findings from the associated broader resilience study resulted in the identification of six resilience building domains: valuing culture and identity; developing cultural leadership; nurturing strong relationships; building social and emotional skills; creating safe, supportive environments; and building staff capacity. These domains became the resulting framework for STEP-UP planning and enabled focused examination of practices and future planning. Learnings from the intervention process suggest principles to consider when designing interventions: utilising a strengths-based approach; design responsiveness; collaborative partnerships; institutional capacity; and sustainability. A resilience toolkit website was developed to enable knowledge translation and sustainability beyond the study. © Society for the Provision of Education in Rural Education. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: In recent decades, a number of sustainable strategies and polices have been created to protect and preserve our water environments from the impacts of growing communities. The Australian approach, Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD), defined as the integration of urban planning and design with the urban water cycle management, has made considerable advances on design guidelines since 2000. WSUD stormwater management systems (e.g. wetlands, bioretentions, porous pavement etc), also known as Best Management Practices (BMPs) or Low Impact Development (LID), are slowly gaining popularity across Australia, the USA and Europe. There have also been significant improvements in how to model the performance of the WSUD technologies (e.g. MUSIC software). However, the implementation issues of these WSUD practices are mainly related to ongoing institutional capacity. Some of the key problems are associated with a limited awareness of urban planners and designers; in general, they have very little knowledge of these systems and their benefits to the urban environments. At the same time, hydrological engineers should have a better understanding of building codes and master plans. The land use regulations are equally as important as the physical site conditions for determining opportunities and constraints for implementing WSUD techniques. There is a need for procedures that can make a better linkage between urban planners and WSUD engineering practices. Thus, this paper aims to present the development of a general framework for incorporating WSUD technologies into the site planning process. The study was applied to lot-scale in the Melbourne region, Australia. Results show the potential space available for fitting WSUD elements, according to building requirements and different types of housing densities. © 2011 WIT Press.

Abstract: Although there is widespread consensus in human geography that neoliberalism is achieved through the intersection of multiple scales and states, there has been growing emphasis in recent years on the hybrid qualities of neoliberalist-styles of governance. Because hybrid approaches draw attention to the wide range of actors and contradictory agendas underpinning the always uneven expression of neoliberalist projects, they are particularly suited to the identification of residual state capacities in contexts where neoliberalist forms dominate economic and political life. Drawing on two cases of large-scale residential development in New South Wales, namely Warnervale Town Centre on the New South Wales Central Coast and the Australian Defence Industry site at St Marys in Sydney's west, the present paper adopts an hybrid approach in order to identify current state capacities. Through a comparison of both sites, it identifies the potential for socially and ecologically balanced development in the outer suburban context.

Abstract: Grace Ikombi was eighteen years old in the early 1990s when he fled his dusty village in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), for the capital city of Kinshasa. His father was dead after succumbing to malaria, a disease that can be cured with a $2 treatment. His mother had been murdered by Congolese rebels for providing medical care to loyalists of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Ikombi was exhausted and hungry. "I heard that the rebels at least were eating," he shrugged. "So I joined them."1 In Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 1,500 miles to the northwest of Kinshasa, stories like Ikombi's are familiar. Morifère Bamba, a member of a rebel group operating out of an Abidjan slum, quit school at the age of twelve. His family was mired in poverty. His mother died and his father could no longer provide for him. So Morfère moved to Abidjan. "The city," he said, "would give me the ability to realize my dream." Yet Morfère found his road to employment blocked by violence on the street. He drifted between criminal gangs before landing in a rebel group. The rebellion offered him an identity as well as sustenance. Indeed, French researcher Ruth Marshall-Fratani observes of Côte d'Ivoire: "The gap between aspirations and possibilities has widened incredibly in the last fifteen years."2 Côte d'Ivoire was once one of the most prosperous countries in Africa, relying heavily on agricultural exports to build its economy. To demographers and development experts, it was the "Ivorian Miracle" in a region marked by deep poverty.3 But as commodity prices dropped in the 1980s and 1990s, state coffers were depleted, investors fled, and conditions began to deteriorate. Corruption and mismanagement-such as kickbacks from cocoa producers and extortion by the police-weakened the government's financial base and eroded public trust in government. The infrastructure fragmented. By the late 1990s, only 55 percent of the adult population was literate and 58 percent had no access to potable water.4 Soon, Côte d'Ivoire fell into the same war-ridden cycle of impoverishment and conflict that has enmeshed the DRC. In the fall of 2002, war between rebel insurgents from the poorer northern region and government loyalists in the more prosperous south erupted in Côte d'Ivoire, fueled in part by cultural and political factors. As the state descended into civil war, it was ill-equipped to extinguish an insurgency fed by a volatile cocktail of soaring unemployment rates and a sharp economic downturn.5 Across the developing world, poverty undermines state capacity to create jobs, educate people, and provide basic health services. Today, civil conflict is by far the most common form of armed warfare, and its occurrence is overwhelmingly concentrated in poor countries that lack the capacity to govern.6 In 2005, 90 percent of armed conflicts occurred in low- and lower-middle-income countries.7 From Sierra Leone and Angola to Tajikistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, civil wars erupt disproportionately in countries and regions facing endemic poverty, sharp economic decline, or both. Overall, civil wars in the developing world have claimed more than 16 million lives in seventy-three countries and displaced 67 million people since 1945.8 Scholarship on the causes of civil war reveals a complexity of interacting factors, but the bottom line has become increasingly clear: countries with low income per capita face a substantially higher risk of civil war.9 Less clear are the specific circumstances under which poverty increases the risk of war, as the mechanisms vary from country to country. Still, one central trend is that poverty decreases state capacity, weak states create more opportunities for rebellion, and civil wars then lock poor countries into a spiral that further entrenches poverty. Because poverty undermines state capacity, it creates conditions that insurgents can exploit to launch, perpetuate, and restart rebellion. Poverty and state weakness contribute to each phase of conflict: the initial spark before conflict erupts, recruitment during an insurgency, sustained violence during a full-blown civil war, and recurrence after civil war has ended. Economists invoke this "conflict trap" to explain the puzzle of what Oxford University's Paul Collier calls the "bottom billion": the 1 billion people mired in poverty in developing countries that, in contrast to the rest of the world, have failed to grow in recent decades.10 The conflict trap also explains why, absent developed country interventions, poor and conflict-ridden countries are unlikely to improve their predicament on their own. Civil war disrupts economic activity, diverts resources from public services, can create massive flows of refugees, increases crime and homicide rates, and promotes the spread of diseases that kill millions of people every year, long after the fighting has stopped.11 Humanitarian concerns are not the only reason that Americans should care about the implications of war in distant countries. Wars in those places now have far-reaching implications for U.S., regional, and even global security. Most recent mass atrocities have occurred in countries engulfed in civil war. Furthermore, mounting scholarship confirms that civil war in one country strongly increases the likelihood of violence breaking out in neighboring states.12 In Central Africa in the mid-1990s, the conflict between Hutus and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi helped to ignite a massive civil war in Zaire. Vital U.S. security interests are at stake in several other parts of the developing world where violence has spilled across borders and affected entire regions. In the Horn of Africa, for instance, conflict in Somalia continues unabated despite the presence of African Union peacekeeping forces. Somalia's anarchy has prompted neighboring Ethiopia to intervene militarily and continues to provide international terrorists and pirates with a base of operations. Global security, including that of Americans, is also compromised when conflict zones incubate transnational threats. Conflict zones in countries from Afghanistan to the Philippines, Sierra Leone, and Somalia have proved to be ideal operating environments for transnational terrorist networks. Al Qaeda gained a foothold in Afghanistan in the 1990s during the brutal civil war that followed the withdrawal of the Soviet Union. Most global drug production takes place in conflict or postconflict countries.13 The routes traffickers follow from the country of origin to American, Australian, and European markets also go through conflict and postconflict countries. Diseases also spread more quickly in conflict zones, ultimately threatening people in distant countries. States in conflict or bordering on conflict zones in the 1990s had much higher HIV/AIDS rates than peaceful countries.14 All of these factors convey a strong message to U.S. policymakers: that it is imperative for them to assign far greater priority to breaking the cycle of poverty, state weakness, and violence in developing countries. © 2010 The Brookings Institution.

Abstract: Transitioning to more sustainable urban water management is widely accepted as an essential societal objective. While there has been significant progress in developing technical solutions to the challenges faced, numerous barriers remain at the regime level, indicating that further investigation into the regime is required. This paper reports on a social research project aimed at identifying capacity attributes of a more sustainable urban water management regime. Attributes were identified for the administrative and regulatory framework, inter- and intraorganisational and individual regime spheres. Over 125 urban water practitioners specialising in sustainability in Sydney and Melbourne were interviewed to identify the attributes of a more sustainable regime. The attributes reveal that a sustainable urban water management regime emphasises learning, diverse policy tools and institutional arrangements, together with interaction among stakeholders and professional disciplines. The interaction is characterised by respect, trust and mutual understanding. The sustainable regime attributes are compared to the traditional regime and reveal that while progress has been made towards a sustainable regime, additional improvement is required. Attributes identified across multiple regime spheres indicate potential focus areas for capacity building programs or reform efforts to more effectively enable regime change towards sustainable urban water management. © IWA Publishing 2010.

Abstract: In order to deepen understanding of path dependence in urban transport, this article presents a case study of urban passenger transport institutions in Melbourne, Australia over 50 years. The institutional capacity of the roads and public transport sectors are explored separately and the trends are then compared and contrasted. The main components of the analysis are: structural changes to the organisations, participation on planning committees, access to financial resources, accountability frameworks, membership of forums and relationships with other actors. The conclusion is that, whilst the historical picture is complex, the trend is a strengthening of road planning institutions, and weakening public transport planning.

Abstract: The Murray-Darling Basin contains Australia's most important surface water resource. Ecological damage and threatened water security have led to a cap on further diversions, presently amounting to ̃45% of the total water resource. An increase in environmental flows representing 2% of the total resource is now sought to restore river health. At the same time, there are threats which may reduce water resources by 10-20% in 2020, including climate trends, afforestation, bush fire vegetation recovery, induced losses to groundwater, and reduced irrigation return flows further downstream. We outline the relative magnitude and characteristics of each threat, and highlight the need for improved observation networks, system-wide water accounting integrated modelling, and institutional capacity to support future water management.

Abstract: Purpose: Institutional governance theory is used to explain voluntary corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting in the context of a market governance system in the absence of climate change public policy. This paper seeks to hypothesise that GHG reporting is related to internal organisation systems, external privately promulgated guidance and EU ETS trading. Design/methodology/approach: A two-stage approach is used. The initial model examines whether firms' GHG disclosures are associated with internal organisation systems factors: environmental management systems (EMS), corporate governance quality and environmental management committees as well as external private guidance provided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 187 ASX 300 firms. EU ETS trading is also included. Determinants of the extent and credibility of GHG disclosure is examined in the second stage where an index constructed from the GHG reporting standard "ISO 14064-1" items for a sub-sample of 80 disclosing firms as the dependent variable. Findings: Firms that voluntarily disclose GHGs have EMSs (uncertified and certified), higher corporate governance quality and publicly report to the CDP, tend to be large and in the energy and mining and industrial sectors. The credibility and extent of disclosures are related to the existence of a certified EMS, public reporting to the CDP, and use of the GRI. Firms that disclose more credible information are more likely to be large and in the energy and mining, industrial and services sectors. Originality/value: The paper shows that some proactive but pragmatic Australian firms are disclosing their GHGs voluntarily for competitive advantage in the current market governance system in the absence of public policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to severely impact the natural and human environment. The urban environment is particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change because of a range of geographic and social factors. This chapter aims to investigate the institutional capacity of the private urban development sector in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia to respond to the task of climate change adaptation and, in turn, investigate the role of private financial institutions in funding climate adaptive urban development. The project methodology included a desktop literature review, an online questionnaire survey and a series of semi-structured interviews and focus groups held with members of the SEQ development sector that included developers, consultants, state and local government staff, architects, solicitors, planners and financiers. Larger developers tended to have more capacity to include climate adaptive features in their developments. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. All rights reserved.

It identifies the intended functions of the Council, which include: acting as a mechanism for coordinating approaches to negotiations with the Commonwealth; operating as a clearing house for policy ideas in Australia and internationally; harmonising regulatory frameworks; and developing improvements to service delivery in areas of state responsibility. Informed by interviews with key players involved with its establishment and documentary sources, this article assesses CAF's performance during its first 18 months of operation. It explores the hopes and aspirations of key CAF stakeholders, and some of the issues that have confronted the fledgling organisation. Personnel changes among the cohort of state and territory leaders, and the election of a federal Labor government in November 2007 have altered the dynamics of CAF. The article argues that CAF's emergence is an attempt by sub-national governments to develop new capacity and leverage to address the asymmetries that characterise contemporary Australian federalism. However, there are questions about CAF's future, particularly about state and territory governments' capacity to pursue collaborative agendas given the pace and scope of Kevin Rudd's 'new federalism' reforms and the demands it is placing on their policy and administrative systems. © 2008 National Council of the Institute of Public Administration Australia.

Abstract: For Tasmanians accessing Government services has traditionally required visits to various Lead Agency locations, as service delivery was fragmented and bureaucratic. The Tasmanian Government adopted a customer-focused approach implementing 'Service Tasmania' a One-Stop-Shop service delivery concept. This paper investigates what led to the success of this public service reform and in particular what change management practices were applied during the change effort. Ten common factors of successful change have been identified in the literature; these are explored determining their relevance throughout this initiative. Data were collected with semi-structured interviews conducted with 63 staff plus senior management. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach and open coding was applied during the first pass through the data to reach the initial codes identifying critical terms and generic key issues. Findings confirm that several management interventions were necessary to address resistance and conflict issues and keep the government reform project on track. © 2014 National Council of the Institute of Public Administration Australia.

Abstract: As transnational programs are often advocated as a knowledge transfer opportunity between the partner universities, this case study investigated the knowledge transfer (KT) processes between Indonesian and Australian universities through an undergraduate transnational program partnership (TPP). An inter-organisational KT theoretical framework from the business sector was adapted and used to guide the study. The data were generated through semi-structured interviews with key university officers and document analysis from two partner universities. Based on the thematic analysis of the data, the findings demonstrated that the curriculum mapping process facilitated KT. However, different intentions of the partner universities in establishing the program led to declining interest to conduct more KT when expectations were not met. The Indonesian university’s existing knowledge, acquired from other sources through processes that were serendipitous and based on individual lecturers’ personal experience, meant that KT opportunities through the TPP were not always pursued despite written agreement to exchange knowledge with the Australian partner. While KT most evidently resulted in institutional capacity development for the Indonesian university’s school that managed the TPP, dissemination of knowledge to other units within the university was more challenging due to communication problems between the units. Hence, other universities seeking to conduct KT through TPPs need to understand each partner university’s intention in establishing the partnerships, identify the institutions’ needs before seeking knowledge input from the partner university and improve the communication between and within the universities for sustainable benefits. © 2015, Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

Abstract: The history of river management in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin demonstrates the effective limits of political and financial power in a federal system. While the financial power rests overwhelmingly with the federal government, state governments with greater knowledge and administrative capacity have pursued their own different goals. Backed by a funding package of over $12 billion Australian over ten years the federal government is currently implementing a comprehensive Basin Plan. This involves not only a shift in responsibility for high level policy to the national government but also an attempt to make river management sustainable from a basin-wide perspective The Council of Australian Governments has unanimously agreed that reform is needed but the proposed policy and institutional changes introduced by the federal government are being widely resisted by state governments . This chapter places the current debate within its historical context and discusses a new set of institutional arrangements that are emerging unplanned and unintended but which could prove quite robust and moderately effective. © Oxford University Press, 2015.

Abstract: This paper traces key policy challenges facing Australia's metropolitan cities as a result of multi-scaled shifts in their governance contexts. These shifts, related both to the neoliberal erosion of a national commitment to universal social provision and to the adoption of a 'competitive city' governance paradigm at the urban scale, have produced a set of governance challenges, especially concerning urban social inclusion and cohesion. Moreover, a range of institutional obstacles continues to hinder the generation of urban governance capacity to address these challenges. The paper works through the nature of these obstacles and takes a pragmatic approach to identifying existing and fledgling opportunities to mobilize and re-energize the capacity to govern in Australia's big cities. In particular it points to the need for a national urban governance agenda addressing a stifling institutional fragmentation, the need to move beyond the limits of the 'competitive city' governance paradigm to mobilize the resilient capacities of State intervention, and the need to harness private resources and capacities more effectively to public policy rather than market-driven aspirations. In working through these needs, the paper also considers the potential of recent initiatives of the newly elected Rudd Federal government, which recognize and provide policy responses in each of these domains, to boost existing opportunities and to enhance substantially capacities for the governance of Australia's major cities.

Abstract: The international spread of antitrust suggested the historical process shaping global capitalism. By the 1930s, Americans feared that big business exceeded the government's capacity to impose accountability, engendering the most aggressive antitrust campaign in history. Meanwhile, big business had emerged to varying degrees in liberal Britain, Australia and France, Nazi Germany, and militarist Japan. These same nations nonetheless expressly rejected American-style antitrust as unsuited to their cultures and institutions. After World War II, however, governments in these nations – as well as the European Community – adopted workable antitrust regimes. By the millennium antitrust was instrumental to the clash between state sovereignty and globalization. What ideological and institutional factors explain the global change from opposing to supporting antitrust? Addressing this question, this book throws new light on the struggle over liberal capitalism during the Great Depression and World War II, the postwar Allied occupations of Japan and Germany, the reaction against American big-business hegemony during the Cold War, and the clash over globalization and the WTO. © Tony A.

Abstract: Payroll-tax thresholds make firms smaller than they would otherwise be and concentrate firms at just below threshold employment. We estimate the resulting dead-weight losses under perfect and monopolistic competition. Under monopolistic competition, the threshold-induced dead-weight loss in Victoria is approximately 10 per cent of payroll-tax collections over a wide range of threshold levels. Because payroll-tax design affects the size distribution of firms, it also affects the Commonwealth Grants Commission's assessment of a State's capacity to generate payroll taxes. This violates a principle of the Commonwealth Grants Commission that its grant to a State be independent of the State's policies. © 2004. The Economic Society of Australia.

Abstract: Several recent works have emphasised new relations of hierarchy within international society, primarily involving the claim by certain Western states of the authority to intervene in particular territories in order to build state capacity and the institutions of sound liberal democratic governance. While several scholars have identified these new hierarchies, few have provided a satisfactory account of what informs their formation and reproduction. This article investigates why new hierarchies have emerged within international society, arguing that they are underpinned by a 'liberal social logic of risk', which simultaneously constructs liberal democracies as inherently peaceful and prosperous and non-liberal or weak states as inherently risky and dangerous. Confronted by new forms of debounded security risks, Western societies have sought to manage these risks via interventions in identified 'risky zones' aimed at building liberal political and economic institutions. This argument is illustrated by the example of Australia's new interventionist development agenda in the Asia-Pacific, notably its leading role in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). This interventionist agenda is, in effect, a new mechanism of regional risk management that informs new modes of hierarchical governance in the Asia-Pacific. © 2009 Australian Institute of International Affairs.

Abstract: In light of the best practice recommendations released by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in March 2003, this study tests the relationship between initial public offering (IPO) firm performance and board governance quality, captured by board size, board leadership, board composition, and director"s share ownership. Based on a sample of Australian IPO firms that lodged prospectuses with ASX between 1994 and 1999, we do not find evidence that links underpricing to board structures at the time of IPO. IPO firms' board structures are insignificant in explaining the level of IPO underpricing, and board size is the only board governance variable significant in explaining long-run aftermarket performance, after controlling for the size of the firm. That is, IPO firms with larger boards at the time of issuance perform better in the long-run, consistent with the resource dependence theory. Thus, we conclude that ASX"s best practice recommendations are likely to distort the market-driven practices already in place, and our findings lead us to question the role played by the board of directors in signalling firm quality.

Specifically, we study links between the 'quality' of a firm's corporate governance (CGQ) and the informativeness of its disclosures. We employ six indicators of informativeness. They include document counts, properties of analysts' forecasts and a 'timeliness' metric, in the spirit of b4Ball and Brown (1968), that reflects the average speed of price discovery throughout the year.

Abstract: We compare Australian and New Zealand parliamentary demands on executive governments to 'do something' about globalisation, noting that parliaments are distinctive institutionally - functioning as umbrellas protecting arenas of adversarial competitiveness, with little scope for cohesive institutional capacity. We define 'globalisation' as it is defined by the parliamentary actors themselves: that is, quite broadly with different actors taking different postures towards globalisation depending on party and on political and institutional perspectives. Whether parliaments can respond effectively to globalisation depends on their institutional capacity and political composition - their political resources. We establish the international context in which the two parliaments operate, establishing our hypotheses about institutional capacity from Lisa Martin's book Democratic Commitments: Legislatures and International Cooperation . We conclude that both parliaments have made significant, if often unnoticed, contributions to the political management of globalisation.

Abstract: Commercial success in universities in the USA and Canada has resulted in many other countries taking steps to emulate this performance and major technology transfer and commercialisation support programmes have been launched in UK, Europe, Australia, Japan and many other countries - including South Africa. Unrealistic expectations have, however, been generated by the spectacular successes of a relatively few institutions and it is not always realised that the success from commercialisation is proportional to the magnitude of the investment in research. Without a well funded, high quality research system, it is not possible for technology transfer to make any significant contribution to economic development. The possible economic returns to higher education institutions from commercialisation of research can be estimated using international benchmarks. This forecast uses a combination of an institutional return on investment model and a simple economic projection. The model is generic and can be adapted for use in any institution. As more data becomes available from local (and international) sources, the model will be refined to give better estimates. The model is dynamic and shows, quantitatively, why it can take up to 10 years for an institution, and 20 years nationally, to attain a positive rate of return from an investment in research and technology transfer. The model enables the long-term impact of policy decisions, in an institution and nationally, to be examined and alternative scenarios explored. The performance of individual institutions is, however, highly variable and unpredictable. This is even for those institutions that are comparable in size and maturity. A large portfolio of patents and licences is required to give a reasonable probability of positive returns. This may be possible at a national level, but is problematic in smaller institutions - and smaller countries. Because the benefits of the innovation system are captured largely at national level, with institutions having a high uncertainty, public sector support to reduce the institutional risk is necessary to assist institutions to make the necessary investments. Technology transfer is of course only one element of the overall research and innovation value chain. All elements must be functioning effectively to derive the economic and social benefits from research. In addition to a strong research system, adequate incentives must exist to encourage academics to participate, particularly with regard to the crucial initial step of invention disclosure. After disclosure, sufficient institutional capacity must be in place to take an idea, evaluate it, protect the intellectual property appropriately and then seek a path to commercialisation through either licensing or start-up company formation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to identify the basis of regional competence in industry sectors that are not key performers at the national level. The paper examines the ICT sector in two regions: Dresden (Germany) and Adelaide (Australia). The performance of Australia and Germany in ICT is not high by OECD standards. However, both Dresden and Adelaide have some competence in parts of the ICT sector that departs from national patterns. In Dresden the development of the ICT sector is more advanced than in Adelaide. In both regions, there are distinctive institutional features and policies that explain the development of the ICT sector. Further, in Dresden, the state has coordinated the ICT sector within the regional space, giving focus to institutional strengths in research and training, such that it is possible to describe the institutional environment as 'thick and coherent'. As such, the regional space of Dresden has experienced an agglomeration of ICT and can be regarded as more successful than Adelaide, where institutions and state initiatives are fragmented and incoherent.

Abstract: Purpose – The purpose of this study is to develop a governance typology which identifies governance issues and outcomes. Multi-owned properties (MOPs) are a unique property type due to the incorporation of a private governance association. Although there are jurisdictional differences, these associations are generally responsible for the management, maintenance and control of the commonly owned property; determining the contributions payable by each lot owner to the operation of the association; enforcing the rules of the association; and ensuring that records meet legislative requirements. Legislation for MOP schemes was enacted in different jurisdictions to guide the governance and management of these matters. However, challenges relating to the governance of MOPs have continued to be a problem as identified in the literature and practice. Design/methodology/approach – The study first reviewed the legislation in three Australian states to identify specific governance categories and the legislative requirements related to those categories. To gain group opinion about the specific governance issues and outcomes, the Delphi method was utilised whereby industry experts participated in a two-round survey questionnaire. Findings – A typology was developed as a result of consensus found between participants. The findings identified key governance issues and outcomes for MOPs. Practical implications – The governance typology forms the basis for the development of a more comprehensive audit tool for the assessment of governance quality in individual schemes. Originality/value – This paper is the first of its kind to collate issues impacting upon effective owners’ corporation governance and the potential outcomes associated with poor governance practices in MOPs. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: Assessment of the quality of governance has so far relied on socioeconomic statistics and expert opinions, while largely neglecting citizens perceptions. Using AsiaBarometer 2008 data, this paper examines the factors affecting citizens satisfaction with their government in six Asian-Pacific countries: America, Australia, China, India, Japan, and Russia. I found citizen satisfaction with the public services they receive, such as education, healthcare, and public safety, matters most in their assessment of government performance. Individual satisfaction with income, job, and housing also matters. The respondent will disapprove government performance if he or she thinks corruption is serious in government, or elected officials stop caring about citizens once voting is finished. In terms of macro variables, economic condition of a country seems to matters significantly. Especially, if a country's economy is growing fast, citizens are much more likely to be satisfied with government performance. Large within-country variations exist in countries such as China and India, where citizens of different cities or regions may give rather different assessments of government, suggesting many contextual variables not captured by this study. Lastly, citizens satisfaction with government performance seems to be highly divergent from international organizations evaluation of governance quality, such as the World Bank Governance Index. This raises both methodological and normative issues regarding the proper approaches to measuring good governance. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2010.

Abstract: The sustainable urban water management system is likely to be characterised by complex and flexible governance arrangements, increased inter-organisational interaction and wide stakeholder participation, which contrasts significantly with the traditional approach. Recently there has been significant financial investment in urban water reform, however the reforms have not been as successful as anticipated and numerous institutional barriers remain. Understanding and assessing institutional capacity is central to addressing institutional impediments. Institutional capacity comprises individual, intra- and inter-organisational and external rules and incentives capacities. This paper reports on the first case study of a social research project that aims to develop an institutional capacity assessment framework. Empirical data from semi-structured interviews with 59 water industry experts in Sydney, Australia, and a broad literature survey were used. The key capacity attributes identified could form the basis of an institutional capacity assessment tool and reveal common and differing attributes across stakeholder groups which provide insight into stakeholder relations. Synthesis of the results revealed that intra- and inter-organisational capacities were facing particular challenges and should be explicitly addressed in reform, policy and capacity development initiatives. © IWA Publishing 2009.

Abstract: This paper argues that neoliberalism should be viewed not as a unified coherent project but as a series of complex and overlapping strategies that produce hybrid and always emergent forms of governance. To substantiate this argument, the paper reflects on the recent history of Sydney's metropolitan planning and rejects any simple characterisation of its having been transformed from a social-democratic to a neoliberal form of governance. Instead it traces the unevenness with which neoliberalist aspirations and forms of governance have been enacted through metropolitan planning. In particular, it examines the enduring scope of state institutional capacity to pursue desired spatial and distributional outcomes through planning and suggests that the current reinvigoration of Sydney's metropolitan planning is an opportunity to enhance that capacity and to pursue 'after-neoliberalist' planning possibilities. © Institute of Australian Geographers 2005.

Abstract: State interventions to govern social vulnerability highlight the complexity of contemporary states, marked by neoliberal agenda but also by progressive interventions and the desire for effectiveness. This paper draws on collaborative research with government agencies on social vulnerability in the Hunter region to assess the desirability of undertaking critical geographies with the state. We see states as contested terrains invested with the institutional capacity to mobilise diverse political projects. We argue that critical research in partnership with states is possible, as are mobilisations of the agency of state institutions to promote progressive policy development. The paper explores how we might use engaged research to intersect with the production and circulation of texts, technologies and practices within the state apparatus to achieve desirable change. While critical research with the state involves uncertainties and compromise, with no permanent resolutions, we conclude that states must remain centred in our critical conversations and praxis. In this paper we advance the case for the critical possibilities of policy-oriented research with the state. We reflect on experiences of an engaged research project with state government agencies in the NSW Hunter Region involving the production and use of the texts and technologies as state interventions in social vulnerability. Working through the project's reflexive, collaborative methodologies and our use of critical GIS, we highlight the creation of opportunities to change how the components of social vulnerability were conceptualised, contest policymakers' view of what was "relevant", and shift framing rationalities and resultant state practices. As such the paper contributes to our knowledge of strategic research practices for pursuing critical, progressive projects with the state. Such engagement involves uncertainties and contingent compromise. Yet, as terrains of contestation wherein diverse political projects are assembled and propelled, states must remain centred in our critical conversations and in our critical praxis. © 2012 The Author.

Abstract: This chapter serves to clarify some of the key concepts with respect to the political independence of the police. By graphically illustrating the relationship between degrees of 'control' and degrees of accountability it is argued that the two concepts are not incompatible. The term 'independence' is used in the chapter to refer only to decision making that falls in what is pictured as the fourth quadrant: 'full accountability' with 'no control.' The chapter then outlines the scope or range of the potentially independent decision-making tasks. Relationships between the police and governments have proven to be a source of persistent difficulty and controversy in many countries of the world. In this chapter the experiences of and debates over this relationship in Britain, Australia, and New Zealand during the last three decades are reviewed and discussed. The analysis discloses that, despite similar legal and constitutional traditions, the relationships between the police and governments have played out quite differently in the three jurisdictions. There is, however, a common trend towards greater and more detailed political accountability of the police in all three countries. Somewhat ironically, in Britain, the birthplace of the now common notion of 'police independence,' recent developments have most threatened this doctrine of police autonomy from political influence and direction. In all three countries, however, the impact of more generalized public service reforms (the so-called new public management) has made more inroads into the practical political independence of the police than any explicit retreat from established legal doctrine on this subject. A growing disparity between the practices of governments and the conservatism of judicial pronouncements on police independence is apparent in all three jurisdictions. This is most clearly manifest in movements towards legislative specification of the parameters of the police-government relationship, in preference to reliance on judicial rulings on the subject. In all three countries, however, governments have been reluctant to concede to police any right to complete immunity from political influence or direction with respect to the handling of major public order challenges, such as political demonstrations. © University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2007.

Abstract: Indigenous Australians have a growing capacity to extract monetary payments from mineral development on their traditional lands. Considerable controversy surrounds the possible use of these payments to fund services such as health, housing and education for the Indigenous groups concerned. Critics of such an approach argue that government should provide basic public services to all citizens, and that use of 'mining payments' for service provision denies Indigenous people specific compensation for the negative impacts of mining and an important opportunity to enhance their economic status. There is also a danger that government may reduce its existing spending on services, leaving Indigenous people no better off as a result of allowing mining to occur. This article argues that while there are certainly risks involved in using mining payments to fund services, Indigenous groups can generate substantial net benefits by doing so. Mining payments can leverage additional government spending; fund services at a level or of a sort that government will not provide; give Indigenous people greater control over service provision; and help develop Indigenous organisational skills and governance capacity. A strategic approach is required to minimise risk and maximise the available benefits, and the article identifies policy principles that can be applied to secure such an outcome.

Abstract: The permissive conditions for business-related human rights abuses today are created by a misalignment between economic forces and governance capacity. Only realignment can fix the problem. In its operations in the Indonesian province of Papua, the U.S. mining company Freeport-McMoRan has been accused of assisting in serious human rights abuses, including torture committed by military and private security forces in Freeport facilities and on Freeport property. In the Sudan, a number of corporations, including the Canadian company Talisman Energy and the Swedish company Lundin Oil AB, have been the targets of campaigns claiming that the companies willfully ignored, or positively assisted in, forcible depopulations occurring in and around their oil mining concession regions. The U.S. company Unocal Corporation settled out of court a lawsuit alleging that it had knowingly used forced labor in its extractive operations in Myanmar. More recently, the Australian company Anvil Mining came under investigation for providing the vehicles that facilitated a military operation by state forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an operation that allegedly involved the commission of a number of war crimes, including rape, arbitrary detentions, and summary executions. In the context of contemporary global economies, allegations of corporate involvement in breaches of international human rights standards are unfortunately not uncommon. In some cases the nature and extent of wrongful conduct in which corporations are being implicated might be classified as international crimes. International crimes include slavery, crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and torture. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

Abstract: The state of governance in Bangladesh has a chequered history. The country's battle for independence, and its history of military dictatorships and dysfunctional democracy, have brought challenges in terms of establishing a sound system of governance. The five pillars of public governance have posed formidable obstacles to establishing and reforming key institutions, refining processes and strategies of management and guiding the country towards a more efficient and effective system. Here we analyse the backgrounds of legislators elected to parliament in 1991, 1996 and 2001, legislative accountability, functional mechanisms, and the constraints of regulatory, administrative and economic institutions in order to examine how poor governance practices have created high levels of patronage in return for short-term political gains.

Abstract: Australia has one of the lowest population densities in the developed world (ABS 2012) and a long and sparsely populated coastline. Institutional capacity for adaptation at the local government scale is vital in Australia, because it is at this scale that many discussions around adaptation occur and decisions are made. In parallel to the institutional analysis, an economic model is created to calculate the distribution of the expected costs of storm surge inundation and the potential benefits of adaptation in terms of avoided costs. The chapter considers the three most discussed economically model-able adaptation options within the 'protect' (seawall), 'accommodate' (changed minimum floor heights) and 'retreat' (retreat) categories. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract: Since September 2001, the United States has increased focus on radical Islamist and terrorist groups in Southeast Asia, particularly those in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. Southeast Asia has been a base for terrorist operations. Al Qaeda penetrated the region by establishing local cells, training Southeast Asians in its camps in Afghanistan, and by financing and cooperating with indigenous radical Islamist groups. Indonesia and the southern Philippines have been particularly vulnerable to penetration by Islamic terrorist groups. Members of one indigenous network, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which has had extensive ties to Al Qaeda, helped two of the September 11, 2001 hijackers and have confessed to plotting and carrying out attacks against Western targets. These include the deadliest terrorist attack since September 2001: the October 2002 bombing in Bali, Indonesia, that killed approximately 200 people, mostly Westerners. Since the Bali bombing in 2002, crackdowns by various governments in the region-encouraged and in some cases supported by the U.S. government and military- are believed to have weakened JI to such an extent that it essentially is no longer a regional organization, but rather is one confined to Indonesia, with some individuals still operating in the southern Philippines. The degrading of JI's leadership structure is believed to have altered the group's strategy. More violent, anti-Western JI members have formed breakaway cells. In September 2009, Indonesian authorities claimed they had killed the leader of one such cell, Noordin Mohammed Top. Noordin is believed to have been responsible for organizing the near- simultaneous July 17, 2009 bombings of the J.W. Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta. The bombings were the first successful anti-Western terrorist attack in Indonesia in four years. Their sophistication triggered speculation that Al Qaeda had renewed ties with Top. To combat the threat, the U.S. has pressed countries in the region to arrest suspected terrorist individuals and organizations, funded and trained Indonesia's elite counter-terroristunit, and deployed troops to the southern Philippines to advise the Philippine military in their fight against the violent Abu Sayyaf Group. It has also launched a Regional Maritime Security Initiative to enhance security in the Straits of Malacca, increased intelligence sharing operations, restarted military-military relations with Indonesia, and provided or requested from Congress substantial aid for Indonesia and the Philippines. Also, since 2001, Thailand and the United States have substantially increased their anti-terrorism cooperation. The responses of countries in the region to both the threat and to the U.S. reaction generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics. In general, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the United States and Australia, whereas Indonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to its citizens. Since that time, Indonesian authorities have been aggressive in their pursuit of terrorists and extremist groups. Many governments view increased American pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the political sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream Islamic and secular nationalist groups. The Muslim insurgency in southern Thailand has escalated in recent years as has terrorist activity in southern areas of the Philippines. The report looks at the rise of Islamist militancy and the JI network, and discusses terrorism in the region, concluding with options for U.S. policy. Strategies include placing greater emphasis on attacking institutions that support terrorism, building up regional governments' capacities for combating terrorist groups, and reducing the sense of alienation among Muslim citizens. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Abstract: The integration of urban water cycle management with urban planning and design is referred to as 'Water Sensitive Urban Design' or 'WSUD' in Australia; one of the key elements of WSUD is the management of urban stormwater. In early 2006, the Victorian Government released the Yarra River Action Plan, which allocated $20 million towards tackling urban stormwater pollution. To help ensure this money is allocated in an equitable and transparent manner across all metropolitan local governments a multi-criteria assessment tool has been developed. This paper presents an overview of the multi-criteria assessment tool developed and adopted for selecting WSUD projects that are eligible for funding through Melbourne Water's Stormwater Program. This tool considers three types of indicators: environmental, engagement (engagement with stakeholders and local government capacity building) and financial. Within each category, a series of indicators of different weightings are applied to score a project. Where initial concept designs do not meet the Program criteria, additional work is undertaken to refine and improve the project. The tool and its use are illustrated with a case study. © IWA Publishing 2010.

Abstract: In urban and suburban areas, stormwater runoff is a primary stressor on surface waters. Conventional urban stormwater drainage systems often route runoff directly to streams and rivers, thus exacerbating pollutant inputs and hydrologic disturbance, and resulting in the degradation of ecosystem structure and function. Decentralized stormwater management tools, such as low impact development (LID) or water sensitive urban design (WSUD), may offer a more sustainable solution to stormwater management if implemented at a watershed scale. These tools are designed to pond, infiltrate, and harvest water at the source, encouraging evaporation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and re-use of stormwater. While there are numerous demonstrations of WSUD practices, there are few examples of widespread implementation at a watershed scale with the explicit objective of protecting or restoring a receiving stream. This article identifies seven major impediments to sustainable urban stormwater management: (1) uncertainties in performance and cost, (2) insufficient engineering standards and guidelines, (3) fragmented responsibilities, (4) lack of institutional capacity, (5) lack of legislative mandate, (6) lack of funding and effective market incentives, and (7) resistance to change. By comparing experiences from Australia and the United States, two developed countries with existing conventional stormwater infrastructure and escalating stream ecosystem degradation, we highlight challenges facing sustainable urban stormwater management and offer several examples of successful, regional WSUD implementation. We conclude by identifying solutions to each of the seven impediments that, when employed separately or in combination, should encourage widespread implementation of WSUD with watershed-based goals to protect human health and safety, and stream ecosystems. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract: The worldwide spread of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis (TB) bacteria is out of control and incidents of harder-to-cure TB illness are rising. This article explores the present and potential impact of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB)-a deadly, contagious and virtually incurable disease-on human health and state capacity. Detected cases of XDR-TB can occasion the implementation of extraordinary control measures, because some governments are sufficiently fearful of the disease as to frame it as an issue of national security. Such framing has the potential to precipitate more financial resources and stronger legal powers to bolster public health, but it might also increase the risk that emergency response measures will be counterproductive and/or unjust. Framing XDR-TB as a security issue is empirically plausible, and doing so is a good thing provided that increased response efforts promote rather than hinder the provision of universal access to adequate TB treatment over the long term. Two disease control measures that are motivated particularly by security concerns are border control and patient isolation. This article offers an assessment of each measure by reference to public health ethics in order to differentiate good and bad securitisation.*This article is part of a project on infectious diseases, security and ethics sponsored by the Australian Research Council.

Abstract: Considerable effort in recent years has gone into rebuilding fragile states. However, the debates over the effectiveness of such state-building exercises have tended to neglect that capacity building and the associated good governance programmes which comprise contemporary state building are essentially about transforming the state - meaning the ways in which political power is produced and reproduced. State capacity is now often presented as the missing link required for generating positive development outcomes and security. However, rather than being an objective and technical measure, capacity building constitutes a political and ideological mechanism for operationalising projects of state transnationalisation. The need to question prevailing notions of state capacity has become apparent in light of the failure of many state-building programmes. Such programmes have proven difficult to implement, and implementation has rarely achieved the expected development turnarounds or alleviation of violent conflict in those countries. In this article it is argued that, to identify the potential trajectories of such interventions, we must understand the role state building currently plays in domestic politics, and in particular, the ways in which processes of state transformation affect the development of different and often conflicting power bases within the state. This argument is examined using examples from the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. © The Author(s), 2009.

Abstract: The last decade has seen increasing attention to institutional arrangements and policy outcomes affecting the governance of the world's seas and oceans. Governance is linked to institutional capacity and to the effectiveness of public organizations drawing attention to tools and approaches underpinning effective and efficient institutional arrangements. Australia has taken a high profile in oceans governance, with international actions matched by the development of a number of national initiatives including a national Oceans Policy. Australia has numerous laws and policy instruments addressing aspects of the management of the marine environment, reflecting the federal nature of this policy area where responsibility is shared between the Commonwealth (federal or Australian) government and Australian state and territory governments. The Oceans Policy, implemented by the Commonwealth and applied within Commonwealth jurisdiction, has been a major initiative but its implementation highlights a number of challenges. This article outlines Australia's approach to ocean governance and assesses, through reference to the concept of effectiveness, current governance arrangements integral to the Oceans Policy.

Abstract: Ecological modernisation (EM), in theory and practice, has increasingly become central to contemporary state environmental reform agendas. EM's allure lies in its central tenet that the contemporary institutions of capitalism can be ecologically adapted to achieve ‘win–win’ economic and environmental outcomes. How government policy can best accomplish this aim is contested, however, with weak and strong EM approaches advocating different roles for the state in facilitating ecological restructuring. The latter approaches argue that for EM processes to be successful, state intervention via ecological industrial policy is required. This article makes a unique contribution to the industry policy and EM debate by assessing the manner in which EM was conceptualised and implemented within the Australian government's automotive industry policy between 2007 and 2013. This analysis raises issues about the institutional capacity of states to pursue either weak or strong forms of EM. © 2015, Australian Political Studies Association.

Abstract: Urban local governments are important players in climate governance, and their roles are evolving. This review traces the changing nexus of Australia's climate policy, energy policy and energy efficiency imperatives and its repositioning of urban local governments. We characterise the ways urban local governments' capacities and capabilities are being mobilised in light of a changing multi-level political opportunity structure around energy efficiency. The shifts we observe not only extend local governments' role in implementing climate change responses but also engage them as partners in conceiving and operationalising new measures, suggesting new ground is being opened in the urban politics of climate governance. A review of the Australian context provides important insights for the new politics of energy in the city as, internationally, energy efficiency is reframed as a climate change issue and the city is repositioned as an important strategic space in energy politics and the governance of energy systems. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2014.

Abstract: This paper presents the local institutional and organizational development insights from a five-year ongoing interdisciplinary research project focused on advancing the implementation of sustainable urban water management. While it is broadly acknowledged that the inertia associated with administrative systems is possibly the most significant obstacle to advancing sustainable urban water management, contemporary research still largely prioritizes investigations at the technological level. This research is explicitly concerned with critically informing the design of methodologies for mobilizing and overcoming the administrative inertia of traditional urban water management practice. The results of fourteen in-depth case studies of local government organizations across Metropolitan Sydney primarily reveal that (i) the political institutionalization of environmental concern and (ii) the commitment to local leadership and organizational learning are key corporate attributes for enabling sustainable management. A typology of five organizational development phases has been proposed as both a heuristic and capacity benchmarking tool for urban water strategists, policy makers, and decision makers that are focused on improving the level of local implementation of sustainable urban water management activity. While this investigation has focused on local government, these findings do provide guideposts for assessing the development needs of future capacity building programs across a range of different institutional contexts. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The National Gst and Commonwealth-State Financial Relations: A Neglected Issue

Abstract: While the introduction of the GST continues to dominate economic and political debate in Australia, in terms of its efficiency, equity and compliance cost implications, a neglected but important aspect of the tax reform package focuses on Commonwealth-State financial relations. A central feature of the reform is the replacement of a set of narrowly based and inefficient indirect taxes levied by the Commonwealth and State Governments with the national GST. This is accompanied by substantial reductions in personal income tax rates, giving rise to important implications for the degree of vertical fiscal imbalance (VFI), the efficiency of the States' tax regimes and the capacity of the States to maintain discretion over their fiscal regimes. The Queensland Government has claimed that the initial State compensation arrangements were grossly inequitable, and that subsequent features of the initiative will impede the Queensland Government's capacity to maintain its low taxation status.This paper concentrates on the themes of equity, VFI, State tax efficiency and the question of whether Queensland's days as a low tax State have been ended. Although the degree of VFI can be expected to increase, the elimination of selected State taxes and their replacement with the national GST should facilitate efficiency gains. Moreover, it is concluded that the capacity for the Queensland Government to adjust the remaining components of its tax base, together with the reapplication of the Commonwealth Grants Commission methodology for distributing GST revenues to the States from 2002-03, effectively means that the national GST need not pose a substantial threat to the Queensland Government's capacity to maintain its low tax status. The paper does not attempt to assess the precise impact of the national GST on the economic performance of particular industries in Queensland, which would require extensive econometric and statistical modelling and is outside the scope of this paper. © 2001 Economic Society of Australia (Queensland) Inc.

Abstract: The 2010 devastating floods in Pakistan have starkly reminded the world of the two critical, interrelated challenges confronting Pakistan: economic development and security. And whilst the Pakistan government's capacity to deal with these two issues before the flood was already shaky at best, its position now is even more precarious given the enormity of the task of rebuilding the infrastructure that has been destroyed in this latest natural disaster. Nuclear-armed Pakistan is a large and strategically important country, critically located on one of the world's most important geopolitical crossroads. It is a pivotal player in a region-covering the Middle East, Central Asia and South Asia-which has much potential, but which also has unresolved conflicts and various degrees of instability. Accordingly, because Pakistan is so important to the stability of the region and the world at large, it is vital that it be able to address successfully these twin challenges. © 2012 Copyright Australian Institute of International Affairs.

Abstract: Over the last two decades, recovery plans have emerged as one of the most widespread policy and management responses for endangered species. Often these plans include public and private lands, and the associated government departments and private landholders. Toolibin Lake, in the West Australian (WA) wheatbelt, is a case in point, with a recovery plan focused on an internationally recognized wetland on public land within a predominantly privately owned, agricultural catchment. This paper draws on recent questionnaire and interview-based research with landholders, to evaluate the influence of the recovery plan on conservation activities. Almost all landholders in the Catchment (93%) are involved in revegetation activities, with the availability of subsidies from the WA Government playing a strong role in adoption and its extent. The main constraints to adopting conservation actions, such as revegetation and fencing remnant vegetation, were cost and logistics. Correspondingly, the greatest incentive was financial inducement. Strengths of the recovery plan were identified as increasing awareness, demonstrating government effectiveness, and making funding available to landholders. The communication efforts by the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM), the agency leading the recovery process, were lauded while at the same time the need for improved liaison was noted. Weaknesses were the lack of information and direction from CALM, bureaucracy, limited funding for CALM, and variable adoption across the Catchment. Recovery planning in this Catchment and other similar settings could be improved by a continuing commitment to two-way communication between all those involved, ongoing recognition of the complexities of the government-community interface in recovery planning, and continuing subsidies for conservation actions on private lands where high biodiversity values are at stake.

Abstract: While the economic benefits of the resources boom in Australia have been considerable so, too, have the impacts upon host communities. These are particularly profound in settled regions where intensive mining presents amenity problems, housing shortages, increasing demands on infrastructure, environmental degradation and conflicts with other industries such as agriculture. Attempts to manage these challenges commonly occur through a 'governance' approach involving partnership and hybrid arrangements between a whole host of stakeholders from the corporate, state and community sectors. As the closest tier of government to the local level, local government has found itself playing a central role in mining governance, particularly in responding to and managing community concerns. This paper examines the role of, and challenges facing, local government in managing the impacts of mining - both alone and in collaboration with other governmental actors. It documents these issues as they relate to the resource needs, planning strategies, human capital impacts, service provision and institutional capacity of local governments in some of the most mining-intensive regions in Australia. © 2014.

Abstract: The commitment to recover water for the environment in the Murray–Darling Basin is unprecedented internationally. However, the use of water markets to reallocate water for the environment first occurred in the Western United States in the late 1980s as part of water reforms that remain ongoing. This paper explores lessons from institutional innovations in the Western United States, including design principles to coordinate environmental water management across jurisdictions and adapt to unintended consequences caused by socioeconomic and hydrologic interactions at multiple scales. Two decades of implementation experience in the Western United States suggest a middle path between top-down and bottom-up approaches: nested governance arrangements that invest in local institutional capacity while ensuring complementary state and federal roles for basin-scale integration and accountability. © 2011 The Economic Society of Australia

Abstract: This article cross-nationally compares the choice of performance indicators in two core fields of state activity, tax administration and social security. Exploring the selection of performance indicators in six countries (Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and the US), the article analyses the driving forces for the choice of particular indicators in the context of national administrative traditions and more recent reform agendas on the one hand and the trend towards international exchange and 'benchmarking' on the other hand. The article explores the relative significance and interaction of different driving forces of choice and how this shapes the development and application of performance indicators. To that end, it combines instutionalist approaches with the literature on the mechanisms and effects of international exchange and policy diffusion. Our analysis suggests that existing broad similarities are linked to similarities in core activities and values underlying contemporary public service reforms. Variation in the choice of performance indicators (PIs) reflects domestic factors such as governance arrangements through which broad reform trends are filtered. These arrangements also mediate any direct international learning. Points for practitioners: This article aims to contribute to the debate around how organizations could learn from the experience of others in designing performance indicators and management systems. Potential for cross-national and cross-sectional learning is particularly high in categories where a particular organization has not yet developed performance indicators but others have done so already. But any cross-reading from other countries' choices should take into account that the definition and use of performance indicators is to a substantial extent driven by domestic institutional traditions, governance arrangements and wider national approaches to performance management. The design of performance indicators should in particular take into account the accountability relations in which agencies are embedded. © 2008 IIAS, SAGE Publications.

Abstract: This article examines recent debate over core or 'independent' integrity institutions in the Victorian and Commonwealth governments to highlight some of the need, and potential, for more careful deliberation over options for building the capacity of integrity systems - the second of the analytical themes used in Australia's national assessment. The first part compares resourcing of major integrity institutions by Australian governments over the past 15 years. Staffing and finances are seen as a useful basic measure of capacity, helping lift attention away from the assumption that creation of new bodies necessarily increases capacity. The data also show that some jurisdictions - including Victoria - may yet have some way to go if they wish to match other governments. The second part of the analysis identifies eight further issues for consideration in deliberations on institutional design. Our conclusion is that by working through such issues more systematically, it may be possible to identify new or different institutional options for configuring integrity resources. This could help avoid inappropriate choices - whether unnecessary new bodies, overloads on existing ones or the import of frameworks that do not necessarily 'fit' local conditions - of particular relevance to current proposals for a new Commonwealth anti-corruption agency. © National Council of the Institute of Public Administration, Australia 2005.

Abstract: This monograph examines the challenges facing major city regions in coping with dynamic processes of societal change. Particular attention is paid to the structure of metropolitan governance and the contribution of strategic spatial planning frameworks in managing urban development processes, focusing on recent experiences in Greater Manchester, Metropolitan Melbourne and the Greater Toronto Area. The study exemplifies the processes and inherent tensions involved, focusing on issues of economic competitiveness, social equity and cohesion, and the promotion of sustainably compact urban form. Institutional capacity-building measures are set firmly, however, within overarching neo-liberal perspectives, generating considerable tensions that clearly demonstrate the difficulties of translating metropolitan-wide visions into local implementation realities. The study concludes that the growing complexity of multi-nodal metropolitan structures and the increasing significance of interactional networks, linkages and flows within and beyond metropolitan boundaries, makes the task of metropolitan governance problematic.

Abstract: Acute skills shortages increasingly affect governments' capacity to conduct policy. Yet, responses to the challenge remain patchy. In Australia, as elsewhere, the public service is facing growing divergence between its own urge to undertake systematic workforce planning and slow, inadequate or inexistent response by most of its line agencies. This article analyses recent survey, audit and administrative data to uncover the roots of this puzzle. Current trends are evaluated and illustrated through five case studies, which suggest important roles for leadership commitment, organisational culture, and the geostrategic exposure of organisations. © Australian Human Resources Institute 2010.

Abstract: This paper documents the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party's (FPLP) approach to globalisation under four different leaders, starting with Paul Keating in the early 1990s, and ending at the early stages of Mark Latham's leadership in 2004. It argues that, despite some notable differences, there was a considerable degree of consistency in Labor attitudes to globalisation under successive party leaders: globalisation was seen as inevitable, irreversible, as beneficial for the majority of the population, and as destructive to states' capacity to intervene in the economy. The paper suggests that a number of factors explain Labor's continued support for globalisation in the face of growing public discontent, including the pressures of international institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and big business, ideological factors, and comparatively low levels of economic growth, both in Australia and internationally. © 2005 Australasian Political Studies Association.

Abstract: The issue of why so many young adolescents around the world are disengaging from school and making the choice to drop out is one of the most intractable, vexed, perplexing, and controversial issues confronting educators. Tackling it requires courage and a radical rethinking of school reform around issues of power, ownership of learning, and the relevance of schooling and curriculum for young lives. This means a heightened institutional capacity to "listen." This article describes an instance of a disadvantaged urban Australian government school that realized it had little alternative but to try new approaches; "old ways" were not working. The article describes an ensemble of school reform practices, philosophies, and strategies that give young adolescents genuine ownership of their learning. This school stands out as a beacon that school reform is possible, even for young adolescents from the most difficult of circumstances. However, such approaches look markedly different from where mainstream educational reform is taking us at the moment. Copyright © by Teachers College, Columbia University.

Abstract: Introduction. Institutions play a central role in advancing the field of reproductive health in humanitarian settings (RHHS), yet little is known about organizational capacity to deliver RHHS and how this has developed over the past decade. This study aimed to document the current institutional experiences and capacities related to RHHS. Materials and Methods. Descriptive study using an online questionnaire tool. Results. Respondents represented 82 institutions from 48 countries, of which two-thirds originated from low-and middle-income countries. RHHS work was found not to be restricted to humanitarian agencies (25%), but was also embraced by development organizations (25%) and institutions with dual humanitarian and development mandates (50%). Agencies reported working with refugees (81%), internally-displaced (87%) and stateless persons (20%), in camp-based settings (78%), and in urban (83%) and rural settings (78%). Sixtyeight percent of represented institutions indicated having an RHHS-related policy, 79% an accountability mechanism including humanitarian work, and 90% formal partnerships with other institutions. Seventy-three percent reported routinely appointing RH focal points to ensure coordination of RHHS implementation. There was reported progress in RHHSrelated disaster risk reduction (DRR), emergency management and coordination, delivery of the Minimum Initial Services Package (MISP) for RH, comprehensive RH services in post-crisis/recovery situations, gender mainstreaming, and community-based programming. Other reported institutional areas of work included capacity development, program delivery, advocacy/policy work, followed by research and donor activities. Except for abortion-related services, respondents cited improved efforts in advocacy, capacity development and technical support in their institutions for RHHS to address clinical services, including maternal and newborn health, sexual violence prevention and response, HIV prevention, management of sexually-transmitted infections, adolescent RH, and family planning. Approximately half of participants reported that their institutions had experienced an increase in dedicated budget and staff for RHHS, a fifth no change, and 1 in 10 a decrease. The Interagency RH Kits were reportedly the most commonly used supplies to support RHHS implementation. Conclusion. The results suggest overall growth in institutional capacity in RHHS over the past decade, indicating that the field has matured and expanded from crisis response to include RHHS into DRR and other elements of the emergency management cycle. It is critical to consolidate the progress to date, address gaps, and sustain momentum. © 2015 Tran et al.

Abstract: The regulatory approval for commercial cultivation of biotech cotton in USA, China, Australia, Mexico and Argentina was given as early as 1996, but it was not until 2002 and 2005, that it was approved in India and Brazil, respectively. Such trends of asynchronous approvals and late adoption are common with other biotech crops, too. There are several reasons: lack of regulatory system or framework, institutional capacity of risk assessment, overcautiousness of the public and governments, location-specific needs, intensive protests by anti-GM lobbies, and strengths of private sector breeding and R&D capacity.This study confines itself to examining the regulatory systems/frameworks and biosafety requirements in countries where biotech cotton is grown so as to understand the factors governing approvals, the lessons learnt in dealing with cultivation of the first generation of GM crops – genetically engineered (GE) cotton – and future trends. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

Abstract: The Philippines enacted the Clean Air Act 1999 (CAA) to provide a comprehensive air pollution control policy in the country, adopting an ambient air quality and emission-based monitoring and regulatory framework. Other major policy features of the CAA include introduction of market-based approaches, a ban on incineration, and the conversion of the Environmental Management Bureau from a staff to a line bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. With such key policy shifts, there has been an expectation that the CAA would improve air quality, particularly in urban centres where health-related costs of air pollution have been estimated to be around US$430 million per annum. However, the CAA has suffered implementation difficulties. This article analyses the institutional, regulatory and policy approaches adopted by the CAA and identifies the various issues besetting its implementation, from unfunded mandates to lack of institutional capacity. The paper concludes that the lack of political and financial support has resulted in a series of telling implementation gaps. Additionally, the legislation of stringent uniform ambient quality and emission standards and the imposition of compliance deadlines have only aggravated the implementation deficit. The policy and regulatory strategies need to be redefined to fit the political, socio-cultural and economic realities of the country. © Australian Centre for Environmental Law Sydney 2005.

Abstract: Private nature reserves created by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are increasing, and their growing number and extent means that they can potentially contribute to biodiversity goals at a global scale. However, the success of these reserves depends on the legal, economic and institutional conditions framing their creation and management. We explored these conditions, and the opportunities and challenges facing conservation organizations in managing private nature reserves, across several countries, with an emphasis on Australia. Results from 17 semi-structured interviews with representatives of private conservation organizations indicated that while private reserves may enhance the conservation estate, challenges remain. Legal frameworks, especially tenure and economic laws, vary across and within countries, presenting conservation organizations with significant opportunities or constraints to owning and/or managing private nature reserves. Many acquired land without strategic acquisition procedures and secured funding for property acquisition but not management, affecting the long-term maintenance of properties. Other typical problems were tied to the institutional capacity of the organizations. Greater planning within organizations, especially financial planning, is required and NGOs must understand opportunities and constraints present in legislative frameworks at the outset. Organizations must establish their expertise gaps and address them. To this end, partnerships between organizations and/or with government can prove critical. © 2011 Fauna & Flora International.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: New development: Financial reform and good governance

Abstract: It has taken almost 15 years for an Australian government to again proceed with major financial reform. Earlier this year, the then minister for finance when introducing new legislation implementing the reforms under one Act (the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013) noted that the system was 'not broken' but that it 'creaks at times'. That Act represents about one half of the proposed reforms but is central to their success. One of the more interesting aspects of the reforms is that they were developed in an open process with the involvement of both public and private sector advisers over a three-year period and oversight by the Department of Finance, similar to the approach taken with the ground-breaking public service reforms in Australia in the 1990s. The focus is largely on financial reform as part of good governance, stressing performance and accountability, but also giving prominence to risk management and the associated notion of 'earned autonomy' and less 'red tape'. In addition, attention is given to the need to establish a governance framework that recognizes the increasing co-operation and collaboration across agencies and entities, across governments at all levels and across sectors of the economy. We continue to learn from research in both the UK and Canada in particular, recognizing both the similarities and differences between the public and private sectors. © 2014 © 2014 CIPFA.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The governance of financial regulatory reform: The australian experience

Abstract: The dominant perspective in the literature linking governance, globalization and public policy argues that globalization undercuts state capacity, weakening a government's ability to effectively regulate its domestic affairs. This paper shows otherwise with special reference to the Australian experience in financial regulation. It challenges the conventional wisdom that the Australian state is weak and cannot adopt anticipatory industrial policies. This paper argues that the adoption of the 'twin peaks' model of financial regulatory arrangements is an example of the existence of government-led steering in Australia which can adopt a proactive approach to financial regulation by steering and coordinating policy networks. 'Governance through hierarchy' in the financial services industry may be a function of the government's political entrepreneurship; its skill in setting and implementing an agenda; and an ability to create new policy communities and networks. © 2009 The Author.

Abstract: Royal Dutch/Shell will construct a LNG terminal in Baja California, on Mexico's west coast, for which Shell has already contacted the supply of some 7.5 million ton/yr of LNG from the Asia-Pacific region. The project joins a list of others proposed for Mexico that hope to capitalize on forecast gas demand growth in Mexico and the western US. Gas demand in Mexico will increase by 2.9%/yr until 2010. EIA predicts that consumption will double from 1.3 tcf in 1999 to 2.6 tcf in 2020, with a 3.4%/yr increase. Shell's Baja plant will have send-out capacity of ≤ 1.3 bcf/day. The facility worth around $500 million will come onstream in 2006. Shell and El Paso would construct a regasification terminal on Mexico's east coast, in Altamira, Tamaulipas state. Capacity at the $300 million unit will expand to 1.3 million cu ft/day and will come onstream in 2004. El Paso and Phillips Petroleum plans another terminal in Baja, which will take 4.8 million ton/yr of LNG sourced from a facility being developed by Phillips near Darwin, Australia. The receiving terminal should be onstream in 2005 with output of 680 million cu ft/day. Marathon Oil together with Pertamina of Indonesia, Bermuda-based Golar LNG, and Grupo will bring a 750 million cu ft/day plant that will come onstream in 2005. The terminal will be constructed south of the US-Mexico border city of Tijuana.

Abstract: This article focuses on an ad hoc body, the UK Local Government Pay Commission, as a means of developing a broader argument on the relationship between collective dispute resolution and the nature of public service reform. It suggests that the character of disputes in this sector and the 'fitness for purpose' of those institutions designed to resolve them are critically related to an industrial relations agenda, which is in turn shaped by changing forms of public service provision. An extended period of public service 'modernization' in local government led to a restructuring of collective bargaining with substantive and procedural consequences: new issues emerged and related tensions arose that could not be managed by the traditional bargaining machinery or by the use of existing third-party conciliation or arbitration mechanisms. It required relatively novel arrangements in the form of the LGPC whose nature and operation and lessons are discussed. © Industrial Relations Society of Australia.

Abstract: Municipal planning represents a key avenue for local adaptation, but is subject to recognised constraints. To date, these constraints have focused on simplistic factors such as limited resources and lack of information. In this paper we argue that this focus has obscured a wider set of constraints which need to be acknowledged and addressed if adaptation is likely to advance through municipal planning. Although these recognised constraints are relevant, we argue that what underpins these issues are more fundamental challenges affecting local, placed-based planning by drawing on the related field of community-based environmental planning (CBEP). In considering a wider set of constraints to practical attempts towards adaptation, the paper considers planning based on a case study of three municipalities in Sydney, Australia in 2008. The results demonstrate that climate adaptation was widely accepted as an important issue for planning conducted by local governments. However, it was yet to be embedded in planning practice which retained a strong mitigation bias in relation to climate change. In considering the case study, we draw attention to factors thus far under-acknowledged in the climate adaptation literature. These include leadership, institutional context and competing planning agendas. These factors can serve as constraints or enabling mechanisms for achieving climate adaptation depending upon how they are exploited in any given situation. The paper concludes that, through addressing these issues, local, place-based planning can play a greater role in achieving climate adaptation. © 2011 The Author(s).

Abstract: For reporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2004, Australian companies were required to disclose the expected impact of applying Australian equivalents of International Financial Reporting Standards effective from 1 January 2005. The objective of this paper is to examine the association between the level of disclosure and corporate governance quality. Using a sample of listed companies with 30 June balance dates, we find that the quantity of disclosure was positively related to some aspects of superior corporate governance, such as the frequency of board and audit committee meetings and the choice of auditor. © 2007 The Authors.

Abstract: This study examines two aspects of corporate social responsibility (social and environmental CSR) in 15 Asian countries. The performance of firms in these Asian countries on the two types of CSR is also assessed relative to country economic, political and social conditions, and compared with those of other regions (Western Europe, East/Central Europe, Australia/New Zealand, US/Canada, Middle East and Africa). Drawing from over 8700 surveys of firms in 104 countries, this study demonstrates substantial country and regional differences in CSR. Firms are embedded in different country contexts, with differing underlying institutional capacities. Strong revealed relationships between CSR and country economic, political and social contexts reflect the importance of a country's development of such institutional capacity to promote and support CSR practices.

Abstract: The imperative of “think global, act local” takes on a pressing urgency in any strategic discussion of reforming local government functions and capabilities. A crisis management “literacy” would indicate a more comprehensive reform and re-design agenda for local government than is currently being recognized. This paper identifies a crisis management literacy appropriate for broadening and enhancing local government capabilities within a globalizing context. It identifies major reforms undertaken recently in Australian local government and, clearly, reinforces an awareness of the inadequacy of managerialist and economistic reforms undertaken from the perspective of managerial and governance capacities required to respond to identifiable vulnerabilities and predictable “creeping crises” manifest within local government communities. A new globally-informed “localism” is urgently required within on-going debates about the extent, and adequacy, of the reform agenda in Australia. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Abstract: This paper analyses how effectively local government in Australia performs its functions as a key element of subnational governance. Service delivery and local democracy are identified as the core functions of local government. The analysis takes into account paradigms of public administration, democracy and management, the public organization, accountability and capacity. The concept of 'capacity' brings together many of the issues discussed in this paper. Questions of capacity relate to whether local governments are effectively performing their institutional functions, how they do so with regard to principles of good governance, and whether the dimensions of their capacity can be reformed if there was the need to meet additional demands. © 2015, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Abstract: Confronted by limited resources and the pressures of cutback management, reductions in force (RIFs) have received much attention from both practitioners and scholars in the public sector in recent years. It has often been argued that a RIF constitutes a very difficult task for administrators, who are universally reluctant to lay off personnel, and that enormous levels of organizational stress are experienced when workforce reductions become necessary. Nevertheless, a strategically planned RIF, along with other productivity improvement strategies, may help conserve valuable human resources even in uncommonly bad economic times. This article examines best practices followed in managing a RIF in the Australian Public Service and suggests factors that should be considered for successful RIF processes in the public sector elsewhere, should the necessity arise. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

Abstract: Protected areas that are created to safeguard environmental values such as Indigenous culturescapes may in fact significantly fail in this task. This study concerns such an instance in far north-west Tasmania, where the government adopted a multiple-use resource conservation-development management model for the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area (APCA). The model offers protection of cultural heritage values whilst permitting numerous community recreational and commercial uses. One particular objective is to protect 'an extraordinary richness of Aboriginal cultural heritage' in one of Earth's great archaeological regions (DPIWE, Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area Management Plan, 2002, p. iii). Yet under the auspices of multiple use, Aborigine and others report unremitting damage and loss of ancestral values. To examine how this is so in an actively managed protected area, perceptions of 16 environmental professionals and local residents engaged in APCA planning and management are used to identify three major challenges for appropriate custodianship of the Aboriginal cultural landscape: Aboriginal-Eurocentric conflicts; limited community governance capacities; and deficient regulatory provisions. It is concluded that APCA multiple-use management of heritage conservation is ineffectual and that an alternative governance model is required urgently. The management challenges examined here offer insights for problematic Indigenous cultural heritage conservation in other jurisdictions of Australia and elsewhere.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Terrorism in Southeast Asia

Abstract: Since September 2001, the United States has increased focus on radical Islamist and terrorist groups in Southeast Asia, particularly those in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. Southeast Asia has been a base for terrorist operations. Al Qaeda penetrated the region by establishing local cells, training Southeast Asians in its camps in Afghanistan, and by financing and cooperating with indigenous radical Islamist groups. Indonesia and the southern Philippines have been particularly vulnerable to penetration by Islamic terrorist groups. Members of one indigenous network, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which has had extensive ties to Al Qaeda, helped two of the September 11, 2001 hijackers and have confessed to plotting and carrying out attacks against Western targets. These include the deadliest terrorist attack since September 2001: the October 2002 bombing in Bali, Indonesia, that killed approximately 200 people, mostly Westerners. Since the Bali bombing in 2002, crackdowns by various governments in the region-encouraged and in some cases supported by the U.S. government and military- are believed to have weakened JI to such an extent that it essentially is no longer a regional organization, but rather is one confined to Indonesia, with some individuals still operating in the southern Philippines. The degrading of JI's leadership structure is believed to have altered the group's strategy. More violent, anti-Western JI members have formed breakaway cells. In September 2009, Indonesian authorities claimed they had killed the leader of one such cell, Noordin Mohammed Top. Noordin is believed to have been responsible for organizing the near- simultaneous July 17, 2009 bombings of the J.W. Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta. The bombings were the first successful anti-Western terrorist attack in Indonesia in four years. Their sophistication triggered speculation that Al Qaeda had renewed ties with Top. To combat the threat, the U.S. has pressed countries in the region to arrest suspected terrorist individuals and organizations, funded and trained Indonesia's elite counter-terrorist unit, and deployed troops to the southern Philippines to advise the Philippine military in their fight against the violent Abu Sayyaf Group. It has also launched a Regional Maritime Security Initiative to enhance security in the Straits of Malacca, increased intelligence sharing operations, restarted military-military relations with Indonesia, and provided or requested from Congress substantial aid for Indonesia and the Philippines. Also, since 2001, Thailand and the United States have substantially increased their anti-terrorism cooperation. The responses of countries in the region to both the threat and to the U.S. reaction generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics. In general, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the United States and Australia, whereas Indonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to its citizens. Since that time, Indonesian authorities have been aggressive in their pursuit of terrorists and extremist groups. Many governments view increased American pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the political sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream Islamic and secular nationalist groups. The Muslim insurgency in southern Thailand has escalated in recent years as has terrorist activity in southern areas of the Philippines. The report looks at the rise of Islamist militancy and the JI network, and discusses terrorism in the region, concluding with options for U.S. policy. Strategies include placing greater emphasis on attacking institutions that support terrorism, building up regional governments' capacities for combating terrorist groups, and reducing the sense of alienation among Muslim citizens. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Abstract: This paper looks at the tension between official multiculturalism, understood as a nation-building project that seeks to incorporate migrants into a unified national community even while recognising and fostering their difference, and the extra-national identifications, connections and practices that characterise really existing or everyday multiculturalism in Australia. This tension will be explored by way of the experiences of Vietnamese, Lao, Cambodian, Turkish and Burmese Mon communities in Sydney and Canberra. It argues that the 'new' multicultural subjects dwell between assimilation and transnationalism in a way that challenges our ability to theorise them, and the multicultural nation-state's capacity to recognise and engage them. In future research on migration in Australia, we will need to continue to take cognisance of the established nature of migrants' claims to national belonging and the reality of their local cultural becomings and hybridities; and at the same time take account of the lithe and multi-scalar nature of their identifications beyond the boundaries of proximate community, locality and nation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Abstract: Purpose: The aim of this paper is to identify the factors that are responsible for the slow development of the renewable energy sector in the Pacific Island countries (PICs), and suggest ways of overcoming them. Design/methodology/approach: The paper compares the energy situation in Australia and Germany to that in the PICs, and the state of energy development in the PICs to its African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) counterparts. Findings: The paper finds that policy frameworks are important pre-requisites to the development of renewable energy. In addition, the absence of a science and technology base in the PICs is a serious impediment to the development of the renewable energy sector in these countries. It is found that the PICs are lagging behind in policy frameworks and institutional capacity building requirements as compared to other ACP countries. Practical implications: Policy frameworks must be established as an essential pre-requisite to the development of renewable energy in the PICs. In addition, ways and means must be found to address the lack of proper attitudes amongst decision-makers to the value of a science base in development. Originality/value: The paper identifies the underlying impediments to the rapid development of the renewable energy sector in the PICs, and suggests what could contribute to the lack of an appropriate science base that is considered as a requirement to development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Abstract: This article explores how organizational policy capacity can be developed, drawing on a study conducted in a large human services agency in Australia. Building policy capacity within government agencies is widely acknowledged as important for successfully responding to complex policy problems. The existing literature suggests a range of strategies for building organizational capacity. Findings from interviews with policy workers support the principles for building policy capacity identified in the literature but uncovered a surprising degree of scepticism pointing to significant barriers to their realization. These barriers are identified as emerging out of the tensions between policy capacity and two other domains of governing capacity: administrative capacity and state capacity. These tensions however are highly contingent and dynamic; managing them requires a degree of discretion and judgement, in brief, policy leadership. A focus on developing policy leadership at the level of policy units and teams may present a strategic approach to building organizational capacity for policy work. © 2011 The Editor.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: The role of organisation structure, relationships and networks in building australia's community housing sector

Abstract: Community housing organisations are set to become a key vehicle to build and manage a significant increase in Australia's stock of affordable rental properties. Given that organisations in the sector vary considerably in terms of size, activity, institutional capacity, rate of growth, urban/rural location and regulatory environment - are there any insights from current practice that can guide new housing policy initiatives? Based on a non-random qualitative survey by the Community Housing Federation of Australia (CHFA) of 21 diverse community housing organisations nominated by their state peak body, this paper finds two main common themes. First, there is a shared determination to develop sustainable organisational structures, while there is increasing divergence between growth and traditional housing providers. Second, there is an understanding that community housing organisations need to carefully manage relationships, particularly with state governments and tenants, and overcome capacity constraints through building stronger networks. The paper concludes with recommendations on capacity building initiatives to help frame the delivery aspects of affordable housing policy in Australia, and provides suggestions for future research.

Abstract: Sustaining our community infrastructure and assets is potentially the greatest challenge faced by Local Governments across Australia. At risk is the continued sustainability of assets which support the delivery of many of our community services. Most states have identified a substantial emerging gap in Local Government's capacity to renew it assets. We suggest the problem is broader than the conventional asset management activities and fundamentally requires that we have informed debate at both the national and local levels. In order to have such an informed debate we need access to reliable, consistent and relevant information. However, experience has shown that trying to obtain this information is difficult. In most cases it does not exist and where it does exist it is frequently inadequate. This paper outlines a project that is currently in progress that aims to develop a national framework for the exchange of community asset information. As a result we hope to be able to inform the debate that must occur if we are to solve the issue of the renewal gap for community assets.

Abstract: Recent work on industry policy argues that group and state capacity are important in underpinning (or undermining) the capacity to govern industrial development. Put simply, group capacity - alongside state capacity - is deemed an important ingredient in any recipe for (re)developing national industry. This article further develops the literature on governance and transformative capacity, adding deliberative networking as a key facet. Examining the development of the organic farming sector in Australia, it is argued that the absence of transformative capacity frustrates development. Specifically, although the state has slowly come to see a need for some interaction and facilitation of organic industry development, particularly of a national domestic standard, this intervention is made difficult by the absence of: (i) capable organic industry organisations; (ii) 'in-house' departmental expertise; and (iii) venues capable of fostering policy deliberation. We argue that the reworked concept of transformative capacity can have wider application in making sense of industry development in other infant industries. © 2008 Australasian Political Studies Association.

Abstract: The expanding provision of affordable housing by non-profit community housing organisations, coupled with possibilities of substantial stock transfer from State Housing Authorities, suggest Australia's social housing sector may be entering a transformative phase. Based on a review of restructuring in Britain, where over the last 25 years, traditionally owned and managed 'council housing' has been reduced from over 90 per cent to less than 30 per cent of overall social housing stock, this article considers possible policy implications for Australia. In particular, it analyses British experience which could inform Australian decisions on organisational size, institutional vehicles and governance structures within the context of the future programme of stock transfers envisaged by many commentators on the Australian housing scene. © 2010 Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research.

Abstract: Formulating sustainable forest policy has become a crucial issue today with the increased awareness of global environmental problems including global warming and climate change. Public participation has been identified as an integral part of sustainable forest policy. However, formulating ecologically sustainable forest policy has been a highly contentious and divisive issue. One of the stand out difficulties has been the inadequate institutional capacity to harness the benefits of community participation in forest policy making. Forest institutions frame how society use and manage forest resources. They also determine how society acquires scientific and behavioral information and how this information is communicated and applied in the forest policy process. This chapter examines the community participation in the Australian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) process from an institutional economics perspective. The RFA is regarded as the most ambitious, comprehensive and expensive land-use planning exercise ever to be undertaken in Australia. It was designed to minimize problems associated with resource conflicts related to conservation and development. Participatory and deliberative approaches have been used under the RFA to accommodate a wide range of environmental and socio-economic values. However, the achievements to date have been unsatisfactory. The failures can be attributed to poor rule configurations that constrain or direct action during community consultation, lack of integration of community values into the policy process and inadequate conflict resolution mechanisms. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Abstract: This concluding article summarises the case study findings comprising the Special Issue on 'Advising Australian Federal Governments: Assessing the Evolving Capacity and Role of the Australian Public Service', identifies and discusses cross-cutting issues, and considers strategic implications for future practice and research. It reviews key findings from six case studies - Treasury, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Intergovernmental Relations, Housing, the BER Stimulus program, and Defence - and assesses the policy advising capacity of the Australian Public Service, with a focus on the policy-political interface between governments and officials. Putting recent experience in historical context, it considers the performance of the Commonwealth's policy advisory system, the impact of prime ministers and centralisation, the link between advising and analytic capacities, the system's resilience and readiness, whether recent dissatisfaction over APS advising reflect lack of capacity or a culture clash, and the responsibility for ensuring high-quality policy advice. It recommends developing a more systematic approach to assessing policy advising capability, building on recent APS reforms. © 2012 The Authors Australian Journal of Public Administration © 2012 National Council of the Institute of Public Administration Australia.

Abstract: We report on the establishment of communities of practice at four Australian institutions and evaluate their effectiveness and durability as a means of building staff and institutional capacity for interdisciplinary teaching. A community of practice approach is a potentially valuable methodology for overcoming dynamics of fragmentation, isolation and competition within universities. The communities we established were anchored by a shared focus on the topic of climate change and they worked collaboratively to build relationships of trust and reciprocity between teachers in a wide range of disciplines. The aim of each community was to improve the teaching of climate change through enabling members to integrate diverse disciplinary perspectives, to teach collaboratively, to promote innovation through exchange and to demonstrate leadership within their institutions. The key factors that made our communities effective and durable are: (1) designation of two leadership roles, activator and facilitator, (2) provision for institutional autonomy in domesticating the model to fit local circumstances and (3) a pragmatic emphasis on opportunities for teaching innovation and leadership within existing administrative structures, teaching programs and workloads. We conclude that suitably designed and resourced communities of practice are a viable means of improving interdisciplinary teaching of complex problems by facilitating both staff development and institutional learning. © 2013 HERDSA.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: Why did Divisions of General Practice implement some Access to Allied Psychological Services mental health initiatives and not others?

Abstract: Objective The Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) programs implemented through Divisions of General Practice (now Medicare Locals) enables general practitioners (GPs) to refer consumers with high-prevalence mental disorders for up to 12 individual and/or group sessions of evidence-based mental health care. The great strength of ATAPS is its ability to target vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations. Several initiatives have been introduced that focus on particular at-risk populations. This study aimed to determine the factors that had influenced Divisions' decisions to implement the various Tier 2 initiatives. Methods An online survey was sent to all Divisions. The survey contained mostly multiple choice questions and sought to determine which factors had influenced their decision-making. Results The most common factors influencing the decision to implement an initiative were the perception of local need and whether there was an existing service model that made it easier to add in new programs. The most commonly cited factors for not implementing were related to resources and administrative capacity. Conclusions This research provides valuable insights into the issues that primary care organisations face when implementing new programs; the lessons learnt here could be useful when considering the implementation of other new primary care programs. What is known about the topic? Previous evaluations of ATAPS have shed light on some of the factors that act as barriers to the implementation of new mental health initiatives by Divisions operating in primary care, but there is nothing known about why Divisions choose to implement some programs over others. Previous research suggests that 'barriers' to change, as reported by organisations, may be constructions that are used to make sense of a situation and that the real impediment to change are intra-organisational factors such as the self-identity of organisations. What does this paper add? This paper reports on a survey that was undertaken with Divisions regarding the reasons they chose to implement particular mental health initiatives. The paper provides insight into the barriers that Divisions perceived when implementing new mental health programs. They were primarily cited as funding and resource barriers. The findings also provide further indirect evidence of the role of the self-identity of organisations in change. What are the implications for practitioners? The study has some implications for government policy development both locally and internationally. For instance, it is likely that primary care organisations such as Divisions, especially smaller ones, require support in terms of increased funding and resources if new mental health initiatives are to be successful. Mandating the delivering of initiatives also contributes to their successful uptake. It is likely that as primary care organisations become more experienced with implementing new mental health programs, the perceived barriers will reduce and implementation will occur with more ease. © 2015 AHHA.

Abstract: The Henry Tax Review is a work in progress, but it has already advanced sufficiently to constitute an important case study of state capacity in Australia. Using the Henry Tax Review as a case study, this paper sheds light on the question of whether the national political system is capable of devising and implementing long-term reforms. Whilst specific policy failures inevitably have a contingent dimension in the form of poor strategy and leadership or unfavourable economic conditions, the paper discusses the erosion of institutional and relational structures which, arguably, has diminished systemic political capacity. This is tantamount to a structural weakening of state capacity in Australia, a development which has the potential to erode the potential of any government to enact significant strategic policy change. © 2011 Australian Political Studies Association.

Abstract: Water markets have featured prominently in the reallocation of water rights to restore freshwater ecosystem health. Incentive-based water rights acquisition and transactions have emerged as a market-oriented policy approach to reallocate water resources from existing uses to enhance the provision, regulation, and sustainability of freshwater ecosystem services. This paper develops a conceptual framework to examine factors enabling and constraining successful policy reform and implementation in market-based environmental water allocation. This analysis distills and extends the findings and lessons of a September 2007 workshop in Brisbane, Australia on environmental water transactions. Two case studies were selected in water stressed basins - the Columbia (U.S.A) and Murray-Darling (Australia) Basins - where transactional approaches to environmental water allocation first emerged. The case studies draw upon practitioner perspectives and previous policy and economic analysis in two regions where shared political economic and physical conditions lend a strong analytical basis for comparison. A common set of policy and regulatory reforms has occurred in both cases - albeit in different forms and via distinct paths - to develop three enabling conditions: (1) establishment of rights to and limits on freshwater extraction and alteration; (2) recognition of the environment as a legitimate water use; and (3) authority to transfer existing water rights to an environmental purpose. However, these elements of policy reform are necessary but not sufficient for effective implementation; a second set of driving forces, barriers, and adaptations explains the ability to achieve larger scale ecological outcomes. These conditions include the physical, social and economic factors driving demand for environmental water allocation; administrative procedures, organizational development and institutional capacity to effect transfers; and adaptive mechanisms to overcome legal, cultural, economic, and environmental barriers. The case study analysis suggests that environmental water transactions can play an important role in establishing environmental water allocations, although water markets require ongoing institutional capacity and adaptive governance. The conceptual framework and empirical lessons generated through this cross-case comparison provide the basis for an expanded research agenda to evaluate the design and performance of market-oriented reforms as implementation experience accrues and new programs emerge in diverse ecological and political economic settings. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: In many cases, when governments commit themselves to green policy targets, they also imply the development of 'green' industries to reach those targets. But, how do governments foster the development of such industries? This is particularly relevant because such industries are often in a very early stage of their evolution. Taking the case of organic farming, we argue that the state's ability to foster 'policy capacity' is critical to the emerging development trajectories of such industries. Focussing on the state's ability to generate policy capacity in the Danish and Australian organic food sector, this article suggests that policy capacity develops as a result of high levels of state and associative capacity and the ability to create conditions favourable for corporatist deliberation. The comparative study undertaken demonstrates that these conditions are met in the Danish case, resulting in a high level of policy capacity. By contrast, Australia suffers from a low level of policy capacity as a result of low state and associative capacity and lack of corporatist deliberation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract: New public management (NPM) has been the dominant orthodoxy in analysing public service reform with major implications for employment relations. Drawing on comparative studies of major OECD countries, including Australia, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United States, this article examines recent reforms of public service human resource management. It refutes the proposition that reforms indicate convergence towards an NPM model and argues that the 'varieties of NPM' thesis is also unconvincing. Several reform trajectories exist which have sought to modernize public sector pay, performance and working conditions, but these highlight the existence of alternative models rather than a shift towards NPM or even the emergence of 'varieties of NPM'. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

Abstract: Recognising both the importance of intertidal wetlands and their role in mosquito-borne disease we discuss wise management to conserve wetland values and to reduce vector borne disease health risks. First we summarise the mosquito-borne diseases associated with intertidal wetlands in sub-tropical and tropical Australia. We consider the Ramsar Strategic Plan, its reflection in some key Australian statutes and the relationship between environment-focussed legislation and health legislation. This is followed by a brief overview of mosquito control and its impact on human health. Using a salt marsh example of an integrated process, we describe the development of what was, in the 1980s in Australia, a novel method of habitat modification (runnelling) for mosquito control. Runnelling modifies the tidal water flow on salt marshes, reducing mosquito larval numbers and minimising environmental impacts. The approach is related to two of the Ramsar goals (wise use and institutional capacity and effectiveness). We then describe the extension of its rationale to a complex mangrove system. Finally, with a concept model, we consider the convergence between minimal habitat modification for wetland conservation and human health protection using an interdisicplinary approach involving multiple stakeholders. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The experience of these senior managers and policy workers is then reinterpreted in terms of a nodal governance model. The findings from the Australian study on policy capacity, interpreted in the context of nodal governance, is then used to discuss the features of "governance capacity" as articulated in the matrix model of policy capacity developed by Wu, Ramesh and Howlett (2015).The article concludes with propositions for strengthening policy capacity across the governance regime so depicted.

Abstract: This paper reports and analyses findings from a qualitative study that explored the impact of organizational policy, cultures and support structures on the research pathways of early career researchers within one Australian university. The author captured the perspectives and experiences of six early and six senior researchers and examined the degree to which respondents perceived their university was effective in supporting the early career researcher to sustain and progress their research. As this paper explores, giving voice to academics' lived experiences of research raised questions as to the efficacy of existing institutional support structures as significant gaps between internal research policy and the lived research experience on the ground were revealed. Ultimately, understanding academics' lived experiences of research may not only build institutional knowledge to inform and enhance institutional capacity to more effectively sustain and grow quality research, but also strengthen advocacy for much-needed and targeted external research funding. © 2012 Copyright European Higher Education Society.

Abstract: In their Institutions for the Earth (1993), Haas, Keohane and Levy argue that, at the international level, three fundamental conditions must be met for the effective management of environmental problems. They summarise these conditions as the three 'Cs' - the building of concern; the existence of a suitable contractual environment; and the growth of state capacity. We applied the Haas, Keohane and Levy (HKL) model to three case studies at the national level, in order to ascertain the extent to which the three Cs explained the emergence of successful institutional regimes. We found that two of the three variables - improvements to the contractual environment and increases in state capacity - had considerable explanatory power. Concern was important in providing the motive force for change, but high levels of concern did not lead to effective institutional regimes unless the other two factors were present. We found a strong reciprocal relationship between state capacity and the contractual environment - the ability to monitor solutions and to generate policy-relevant 'trustable' information, was positively associated with improved negotiating structures and outcomes.

Abstract: Liberal democratic states like Australia manage criminal justice issues in ways which reflect an inbuilt tension between liberal and democratic values. Liberal democracies are responsive both to liberal claims and to democratic claims. As a result, policy debates and strategies can oscillate between (on the one hand) liberal sensitivity to individual rights and opposition to enhanced state capacity and (on the other hand) democratically legitimised community norms and collective values. Four crime-related policy debates - about the creation and operation of the National Crime Authority, about strategies for combating drug-related crime, about gun control legislation and about identity systems to counter money laundering, tax evasion and public benefit fraud - illustrate the characteristic liberal democratic mode of politics in operation. The spectrum of policy responses to crime issues within liberal democratic political systems corresponds to an analogous spectrum within criminology which encompasses individualistic and structuralist conceptions of the nature and causes of crime.

Abstract: A remarkable process of reform of intergovernmental arrangements was initiated in Australia in 1990 designed, according to its proponents, ‘to improve our national efficiency and international competitiveness and to improve the delivery and quality of services governments provide’. Unlike previous ‘new federalisms’ in Australia (and elsewhere) the reform process on this occasion was neither totally unilateral, nor top‐down in design and implementation. Rather, while reflecting the commonwealth (federal) government's frustrations at the limits imposed by the federal system on its political power and administrative capacity, the process intentionally was cooperative, incorporating all state and temtory government leaders, and including representatives of local government. In the context of a review of the origins, nature and objectives of the reform initiative, this article points both to the valuable innovations embodied in its processes, and to the risks of reduced political access and citizen participation created by its attempts to apply ‘single‐government’ managerialist principles to the redesign of intergovernmental arrangements in federal systems. Political and bureaucratic objectives, combined with a lack of adequate appreciation of federal principles, led, in our view, to an attempt to supplant participatory politics with relatively less accessible and responsive managerial structures.

Abstract: Performance measurement and programme evaluation have been promoted as a central mechanism of recent Australian public sector (APS) reform. Outlines recent reforms in the APS and identifies links between evaluation and performance information. Identifies the major issue of credibility, when performance information is produced internally and not verified externally. A lack of performance systems and standards can create difficulties for both internal and external programme evaluations. Concludes that: reforms introduced to evaluate performance in the APS were promoted with high expectations which have only partially been fulfilled; the present system is internally focused with a narrow role for evaluation and a lack of credibility because of the independence issue; the present systems associated with the performance approach and its evaluation are not providing enough information to deal with the tough questions of the effectiveness of government programmes. Proposes that a middle ground between internal and external programme evaluation strategies be adopted. This allows the strengths of internal evaluation to be retained. At the same time, it allows the possibility of improving programme evaluation by adding external independent verification and an extended effectiveness role.

Abstract: In the context of calls for a 'third way' which proposes the abandonment of many of the social democratic and statist commitments of the postwar era, this paper reviews both the responsibilities accepted by peak bodies such as ACOSS and those that ought to be retained by government. It is sceptical of claims that social policy debates in Australia lead to the conclusion that welfare state development here has been satisfactory. Social democratic objectives (derived from intellectual contributions in the 1940s and 1950s as well as from the comparative political economy of the 1980s and 1990s) emphasize more decommodified provision of services than can be readily admitted in Australia. If the demand for social welfare and social policy continues to increase to the extent suggested by past and present circumstances, serious implications emerge for both public and private providers.

Abstract: Abstract:  Since World War Two, the role of non profit think tanks in the United States has grown and diversified. Today, the United States' government and Congress is advised on many matters of policy‐making and implementation by such think tanks. The Westminster system of parliament, as practised in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, has rarely provided a fertile ground for the creation and sustained existence of such privately operated institutions. Despite limited links with similar United States' organizations, the seeds have never really flourished outside the United States of America. Australian Commonwealth governments have been most antagonistic in this regard. On the other hand, management consulting companies, many of which have headquarters in the United States, lobbyists, and corporate representation flourish in the quasi‐corporatist political environment carefully constructed by the Australian Labor party (ALP) government since 1983. Policy‐related research divisions and statutory authorities have likewise grown in size and importance within the departmental agencies of government itself. Energy, agriculture, immigration, and social service research “arms” have been encouraged within the ministerial arena of policy analysis and advice. Especially important has been micro and macro‐economic research, urban and infrastructural planning, the Industry Commission, and the Bureau of Industry Economics, respectively. This paper will analyse the growth of these specialized forms of government think tanks, study the range of their ministerial advice, and speculate about their changing role in an increasingly “managerialist” type of Westminster‐style parliamentary setting. Sommaire:  Aux États‐Unis, depuis la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, le rôle des groupes de réflexion à but non lucratif, ou think tanks, a pris de l'ampleur et s'est diversifié. Aujourd'hui, ces groupes prodiguent des conseils au gouvernement et au Congrès des États‐Unis sur de nombreuses questions de définition et de mise en oeuvre de politiques. Le système parlementaire de Westminster, tel que pratiqué au Royaume‐Uni, au Canada, en Nouvelle‐Zélande et en Australie, a rarement favorisé la création et l'existence de telles institutions exploitées par le secteur privé. Malgré certains liens limités avec des organisations américaines similaires, elles ne se sont jamais vraiement épanouies à l'extérieur des États‐Unis. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Abstract: Given the increasing importance of constitutional modification in Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Africa, Europe, and Australia, it is imperative to study systematically the conditions under which formal constitutional amendments are likely to fail. In this paper, the authors isolate conditions whereby the instrumental objectives of participants in the politics of constitutional modification threaten to overload the institutional capacity of the amending process. The proximate cause of amendment process overload is indeterminacy regarding the redistributive impact of the proposed change. Redistributive indeterminacy is a function of a rigid amending process, an institutional structure that encourages a large number of constitutional players and amendments which provide broad scope for judicial interpretation. The authors isolate two critical factors: the intensity of mass and elite preferences surrounding constitutional proposals and the structure of the amending process itself. They next trace these factors back to institutional variables to create a model to explain and predict constitutional failure in a range of contexts.

INFO:root:Prompt: Title: THE FORGOTTEN ROYAL COMMISSION: PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA

Abstract: The publication Public Service Inquiries in Australia edited by R.F.I Smith and Patrick Weller (1978) concentrated on the wave of inquiries that swept Australia in the 1970s with most attention being given to the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration (RCAGA). While the focus of the book was on contemporary developments, Roger Wettenhall's chapter 2 outlined “A Brief History of Public Service Inquiries” so as “to set the present generation of inquiries more firmly in a historical context” (1978, p.15).
